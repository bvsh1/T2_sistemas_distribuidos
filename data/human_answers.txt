1-2 pounds a week is usually the amount that is healthy.  Just make sure that you are eating enough calories when your exercising, usually people tell you "You have to burn more calories then you're eating"  but when your exercising its extremely important to make sure you're eating the right calories, not empty ones.  Also if you have access to a free gym you should see if they have a nutritionist, most do now and you can have a consultation that works with your exercise program.  Don't get discouraged if you dont see a significant change in the first 6 weeks or so, it takes your body time to adjust and start burning that fat and building muscle.  good luck!
I assume we're talking about chronic stuffiness, right?  If so, I find that, in my personal experience, it's not so much what I eat as it is what I avoid.\\n\\nIf you were my client, I'd suggest that you keep a food diary for a couple of weeks and see if you spot any patterns.  Common foods that cause stuffiness include refined starches, rice and dairy.  (A plate of spaghetti will do it to me every time!)\\n\\nBest wishes.
The rules for eligibility for the draft varies depending on the league.  If a league allows 18 year olds to be drafted, like the NBA used to, then it's a matter of some team thinking that the player in question is good enough to be drafted.\\n\\nIn short, high school players get drafted because league rules allow it, and some team thinks that the player is worth drafting.

There are two basic skills needed to create software.\\n\\n1) Knowledge of the platform and tools to develop and test the code\\n\\n2) Knowledge of the subject matter the application deals with.\\n\\nThis is true if you are writing an Accounting package on an IBM mainframe, a game for a PS2, or a utlity for MS Windows.\\n\\nIf we are talking high school, Geometry (specifically proofs) is a good yardstick to measure your ability to follow a process flow (1 above).  Also, most schools offer "Business Computer Programming" which is better for those wanting to write business applications (1 and 2 above), and "Computer Science" for those wanting to go the technical/scientific/mathemetical route.  In college, look in the Business Administration department if you want to write business apps (1 and 2 above), and check out Computer Science for other things (1 above).\\n\\nThe standard Sciences (Bioology, Physics, Chemistry, etc) are important in you are going to write applications in those areas (the part 2 above).  Also, if you want to write Engineering applications, get heavy into Physics and Math.

I find it hard to believe that. If he lost to Mayorga, he would probably set a rematch for September 16th. He was looking forward to fighting Pretty Boy Floyd then, but how could he resist going out with a vengeance? ;D\\n\\nI do believe he's going to retire soon, but unless Mayorga finds a way to completely dominate Oscar (which I doubt), I see De la Hoya sticking to that one last fight he has planned.

Originally, there was enough to feed 135 people for 28 days, so 135 * 28 = 3,780 daily rations.\\n\\nAfter 9 days, there were 135 * 19 = 2,565 daily rations.  Now there are 36 additional people, making 135 + 36 = 171 people.  New rations are 3/4 the original size, so there are 4/3 * 2,565 = 3,420 "new rations".\\n\\n3,420 "new rations" / 171 people = 20 days.  Add back the original 9, and the food lasts 29 days.

Considering that the studio were attempting to cash in on the recent upsurge in Comic book adaptations then it is quite possible that they were looking to attract a certain audience. The first is easy, i.e. people like yourself who are readers of the comic and would go and see the movie just to see what they did with it. Second audience would be anyone who was remotely interested in Keanu Reeves, the biggest percentage being women aged between 15 and 45 therefore by not alluding to the bisexuality that is present in the comic they would not alienate this second and possibly bigger audience thus ensuring their profit margins. I know a little cynical but hey! and anyway throughout the movie Constantine doesn't seem really turned on by either male or female instead we are lead by the reactions of Rachel Weiz's character who seems more attracted to him than he is to her hence no kiss. But what do I know  - in scenes cut he might have been running around snogging everything that moved and wearing a pink feather boa interesting concept for the next movie no?
essays have to be lively and the reader should be interested in going through your piece. Try to associate the topic with your own life experience.. this will help you to put forward more vivid ideas in it. Try to avoid repetaticve words ..instead use different forms of the same word if it is required. give suitable quotations anf try to put some jolly and lively words or sentences in your esay so that the reader enjoys what you have written... But mind you... u have to decide very carefully what u write based on the topic u choose. for serious and debate type of topics  u have to be serious.... any way all the best for tomorrow

Since the government controls the internet in China, Yahoo (& Google) block those sites so they can still get traffic from China - since China has the largest population, they feel it is too much of a risk to be COMPLETELY blocked. So, they block a few sites, they continue getting those important "hits" to their web counters, the Chinese government censors "subversive" material and the only loser is the Chinese web surfer.
No no.. the English fans were taunting German supporters and that is how it escalated to the violent confrontation that ensued. Terrible behaviour.

I'm a woman and guess what, we get those same urges. Would you want your wife to follow her urge to fool around? Could you live with that kind of guilt every time that you look at your wife? I'm really not trying to belittle you or anything like that, I just want you to know that women get those same urges, but if you value what have made together with your wife you must take the time to think about how you would feel if it was her getting those urges. By the way it is normal for any age. We get comfortable and forget what it was like when we first met and fell in love.
15 lbs in 4 months is a very good pace. . . thats only about 3 or four lbs a month.  Basically you will need to eat about 500 calories less per day than what you need.  So lets say you are 180 lbs, and want to be 165.  you probably want to eat about 1800-1900 calories a day to maintain that weight.  so you want to eat about 1600-1700 day to lose weight gracefully.\\n\\n3500 calories=1 lbs.  adn to lose 15 lbs in four months, you should try to lose about 1 lb. a week!  Good luck!

In my first trimester, I had diarrhea instead of morning sickness.  And then came the constipation.  Make sure to eat lots of fiber, you will need it-apples and whole grain pasta, bread, and rice.

Indeed some do as stated above, usually due to the accretion forces of a supermassive black hole, like the 200,000 solar mass one at the center of our galaxy, or the 2,000,000 solar mass one at the center of galaxy M87. Surrounding them are dead stars in the form of dwarves, or even some very ancient population II stars.\\n\\nA few things that were incorrectly stated, are that galactic rotation CAN be measured, but it is immensely slow (we are talking one rotation across maybe a couple hundred million years or so, for small galaxies).  Considering that our average-sized milky way is 35,000 light years across, travelling linearly down the center, it would take our sun (going 60,000 km/h) 630,000,000 years to reach the other side. Since it is travelling circularly, it would take something closer to a billion or so years. Likely our solar system has completed about one or two "galactic years," but it is a slow, slow process.\\n\\nFurthermore, not all galaxies rotate, however. Newer galaxies, such as clusters, have no center point nor supermassive black hole, so they are for the most part stationary in terms of rotation.\\n\\nThe blackhole at the center of our galaxy, as I state above, is closer to 200,000 times the mass of our sun, not the giant underestimation of 1000 times as stated above.\\n\\nAnd despite what is says below there isn't a "blackhole at the center of our universe." They are the centroids of galaxies, not the universe. There is no central, universal rotation point as such. Also the explanation below fails to explain why galaxies are denser in their centers - and even then some aren't. Yet the user still complains about other answers' inaccuracies...

A crusty old Marine Sergeant Major found himself at a gala event hosted by a local liberal arts college. There was no shortage of extremely young, idealistic ladies in attendance, one of whom approached the  Sergeant Major for conversation.\\n\\n "Excuse me, Sergeant Major, but you seem to be a very serious man. Is something bothering you?" Negative, ma'am. Just serious by nature."\\n"The young lady looked at his awards and decorations and said, "It looks like you have seen a lot of  action." "Yes, ma'am, a lot of action."\\nThe young lady, tiring of trying to start up a conversation, said, "You know, you should lighten up a little. Relax and enjoy yourself."\\n\\n The Sergeant Major just stared at her in his serious  manner.\\n\\n Finally the young lady said, "You know, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but when is the last  time you had sex?" \\n"1955, ma'am."\\n\\n "Well, there you are. You really need to chill out and  quit taking everything so seriously! I mean, no sex since 1955! She took his hand and led him to a private  room where she proceeded to "relax" him several times.\\n\\nAfterwards, panting for breath, she leaned against his bare chest and said, "Wow, you sure didn't forget much since 1955!"\\n\\nThe Sergeant Major, glancing at his watch, said in his matter-of-fact voice, "I hope not, it's only 2130 now."\\n\\n (Don't ya love military time?!)

Actually, there are a few reasons for this.  Depending on how long you were together, and how serious it was, this is a major change in life and lifestyle, and the human psyche is highly against change, especially something like that which can upset so much else in life.\\n\\nSecondly, we live in a society where men are still encouraged to not have feelings, or to not express them.  Men who do are usually labeled as gay, no matter what their orientation.  It just isn't cool or macho.  Our society has brought men up to be control freaks over that one part of their life, some call it traditional family values, psychologists call it repression.  If you know this for a fact, dump him and move on with life.
depends what you want to train them on. Can be 10 days or 10 sec.

The Sens play an uptempo hockey that relies on accurate passing and quick skating.\\n\\nDuring the regular season, teams have limited opportunity to scout each other due to the crazy tight schedule. During the playoffs you play the same team, and you have tons of time to break down the opponent on tape and see what they do, pick their plays apart and discover other weaknesses. Buffalo, which is one of the most defensively sound teams in the NHL were able to shut down the Sen's passing game and slow down their attack. THey also managed to exploit the big ice surface that opens up as a result of the lightning quick Sens' forwards and their not so quick defenders, when getting puck possesion.\\n\\nAnother important point is that the level of officiating has changed dramatically during the play-offs, no doubt. What was hooking, holding and interference during the regular season is now washed out. This did affect the Sens' in that their forwards were not able to skate into open ice as quickly as they had done during the season, nor did they enjoy as many powerplays as a result of outskating and outpassing their opponents, but such is life in pro-sports.\\n\\nThere is of course more reasons to why Buffalo won... cause they did.. much more than the Sens lost, if that makes any sense. But I suggest you get on a hockey forum like www.hfboards.com, or something like that if you want to dig deeper into this.
I actually preferred a mountain bike with the narrowest semi-slick tyres I could find for riding regularly in London traffic, but thankfully I don't have to do this anymore. It looked strange with Marzocchi race forks, but had a good riding position, was fast, could jump over traffic islands and I never had an on-road accident on it in years of London (ab)use.\\n\\n Commuting just under 40 miles a day outside London, I used to mainly use an Italia fixed wheel machine from Condor in Grays Inn Road. This was practically maintainance free and very unattractive to thieves - the complete bike with aluminium frame and carbon forks should be around £600. This was also a wonderful bike for 50 mile training runs on a sunny spring morning and I even used it for youth hostelling.I had great fun on it until my knees gave out - and I'm not blaming that on the bike. The same frameset and forks with a Mirage groupset will cost around £800. A couple of clip on crud guards will make it more practical in British weather.\\n\\nF W Evans have several branches in South London and a huge stock of 2005 models at discounted prices. Check out http://www.evanscycles.com/ for details. They sell quality gear and the staff are enthusiastic and knowledgable - recommended.\\n\\nPersonally, I'd scour the ads in Cycling Weekly - I picked up a second hand pro level custom built cyclocross bike here for £500 at a time when the new frame and forks alone would have cost £650. Quality wheels plus Dura Ace and other top end components would have taken it way out of my price range new, but second hand it was cheaper than many entry level bikes. This has prooved to be an amazingly practical bike for everyday use with the addition of an USE suspension seatpost and using 32 mm tyres. There's plenty of clearance to fit clipon guards for road use in winter and it's an awesome tool for blasting down bridleways and canal towpaths in three seasons a year. Mine was made in 853 by a Manchester based firm called Atom.\\n\\nSteel will be more comfortable than aluminium and you can afford decent steel if you're buying second hand. Anything that fits you and has a Reynolds 531, 653 or 853 frame will be suitable, as would bikes using equivalent Italian steels from Deda or Columbus. The best all round compromise for speed, comfort and weather protection will be an audax bike. Anything by Chas Roberts, Bob Jackson, Brian Rourke or Condor is desirable and offerings from Mercian, Thorn, Ribble and Dawes are well worth investigating. Mine is a Condor which I bought new and there is no way I would want to part with it. It does everthing you want as long as you don't put much more than your wallet, passport, camera, keys, first aid kit and maps in the barbag - it gets twitchy on climbs when you're out of the saddle if you do. The only problem I've had is that the dynamo lighting system they fitted never did work, apart from in their workshop - I got so fed up with taking it in that I just gave up and scrapped it.\\n\\nI've just modified this after finishing training and hope it's of some small use. You know that whatever you choose is going to be the right choice. Just go for it and enjoy.

For you, it'll be like trying to ice skate uphill.  You are at a severe disadvantage.  First, you are nowhere near a good facility to practice.  I guess you could beat a ball against a wall (that's what I did for my first 2 years), but without someone to play against, you won't improve much.  Second, you don't have access to a good coach.  Without a coach, progress will be very slow.  If you're serious about going pro, find a coach - now.  If you can't afford a private coach, find some videos or DVDs that will show you drills that you can do on your own.  And never underestimate the importance of good footware.  I've gone through cheap shoes (US$20) in a single day of practice.\\n\\nGood Luck

Id talk to her about it first and guage her reaction.

I was hesitant about walking also, mainly because I really didn't know any of my peers in my graduating class either.  However, I did because there was that whole parental guilt trip thing "We've waited so long to see you graduate!"  I also did find out that some colleges, mainly the larger universities, don't even have ceremonies where their graduates walk.  All their graduates do is just stand up when their specific school/major is announced.  That's pretty lame because you get no recognition whatsoever.  So if your ceremony actually will call your name, I don't think it would be so bad to attend.

Tim, \\nGet as many small sites to link you as you can such as churches, small businesses, independent websites. It will grow.\\n\\nAn additional option is to find "the story", such as mine, that will eventually go national at some point because it's true , and the government can't suppress the truth forever, although the Kennedy - Oswald thing has made quite a run for 43 years.
:}\\nPeople change over time based on nutrition even environment. The theory of evolution depends on a concept called “survival of the fittest”. That theory works as far as our gene pool will allow it to. There are millions of possible combinations within our gene pool; at any given time those genes which best allow individuals to survive and prosper will emerge.\\nBut that is change within our genetic structure not evolution.\\nThe reason men do not evolve is that we cannot create new DNA or new and different genes and they do not occur by chance.
Sorry, to answer your question, I would need more information regarding the underlying reason for the internal bleeding.  Many things can lead to internal bleeding.  Some, such as trauma, may not pose any future threat of rebleeding.  Others, such as arteriovenous malformations in the GI tract, may put a patient at significant risk for recurrent bleeding.  Similarly, some causes can be avoided, such as the use of blood thinners.  Others, such as the aforementioned GI AV malformations, can be more difficult to manage.

u know what - i never thought of or knew that. It really burns me up. What happened to what our nation was founded on? What happened to Christian principles - the REAL ONES? Pretty soon we are not going to be able to be called Americans. We are not united anymore,we r divided. \\n\\nU know, my brother is in IRaq fighting for the rights and safety of this country - what for? we r handing our rights over. there is no reason to fight for them. we r just laying down like dogs and lettiing the rest of the world be our masters. Yes, we are dogs - compared to the Lord. I bow and worship Him no one else, no other person, 'god', religion, country NO ONE!! We need to stand up for what we believe n!

It is not necessarily the exercises rather how you do them. You should pick four or five exercises for each body part, chest monday, legs tuesday etc and do 4 sets each comprising of 15 to 20 repetitions making the last rep of each set very challenging. You only need to exercise a particular body part once every five to seven day seven being the best but really hit it when you do. This will firm and tone the muscles however to see your results you must diet and do cardio.

There are no strictly set rules. The Word of Wisdom says "hot drinks are not for the belly or the body" and we have been told that this means coffee and tea. However, we don't know whether this is indeed because of the caffeine, we just know that we are not supposed to drink coffee and tea. So no, we wouldn't drink de-caff either. And I do drink coke and eat chocolate, even though those contain caffeine.\\n\\nThe Word of Wisdom isn't just about what we can't do. It is an entire health plan which says that we shouldn't drink tea or coffee, shouldn't smoke or chew tobbaco, shouldn't drink alcohol or take harmful drugs, and should eat meat sparingly and eat lots of whole grains and vegetables. What is amazing is that this revelation was given in 1833, in an age where people still thought that vegetables were an inferior food to meat and smoking was good for the heart. And no one knew anything about caffeine or mouth and lung cancer.\\n\\nMormons who live the Word of Wisdom live an average of ten years longer than the general population. (OK, who said "It just feels like longer"??!?)
Any surface with air below it becomes colder quicker than others in the absence of solar radiation. Note how water freezes on a bridge before it does on other parts of a road, or how snow accumulates first on a deck before it does on the ground when the temperature is right around freezing. The ground is a good conductor of heat (warmth from below), air is a poor one. Same applies to frost on the blades of grass but not the bare ground in many spots.\\n\\nAdd to that the fact that especially during a calm, clear night, surfaces such as the top of a car or deck radiate heat to space and become cooler than the air above them. The air cools in response, but at sunrise the temperature of that surface may be 5-10° lower than the air at 2 meters above ground (which is reported).

What do you mean by shorts out?\\n\\ndo you mean that there is an actual electrical short, or that the sound cuts out every now and then?\\n\\nif the first, and there is a wiring problem, then it is because wire have come loose and are touching other exposed wires.  you can take off the cover (depending on the make and model of guitar, you may have to go in through the pick ups) and find the loose wire(s)  and solder them.  \\n\\nor, simply take the guitar to a guitar shop and have them look at it.\\n\\nit could be anywhere. in the guitar if this happens, but if it does, the guitar will most likely not work after the first time it does.\\n\\nIf it is the second, and the guitar cuts out every now and then while playing, it can be a few things.\\n\\none-the output jack that you plug the cable into is loose, and can be fixed with solder.\\n\\ntwo- the cable itself is shot, and should be replaced. you can troubleshoot this by pluging the guitar into the amp with another cord.\\n\\nthree-if you are using a pedal, try bypassing the pedal, just connect the guitar right into the amp.  and see if that changes anything, it may be a loose wire in the pedal.\\n\\nor, maybe the 9volt in the guitar is old, and can be replaced.
you may havc a sty if its localized to one area.  otherwise it may be cosmetic or product irritation.  apply a warm compress or chamomile tea bags from boiling water (have antiseptic properties)
Because water is polar.  Polar molecules can create favorable interations (hydrogen bonds) where + and - charges match up, for an energetically favorable configuration.  Lipids (fats and oils) are non-polar, and do not forma favorable interactions with water and other polar solvents.  Hence, they keep to their own--polar and polar go well together, and nonpolar goes with nonpolar.  Hence, hydrophobic (water fearing) and lipophilic (fat loving) mean the same thing.

In Dentistry, we try to save a tooth if possible. Extraction is the last resort (if a patient is willing to try other routes, as you have done). Sometimes, even with the best Dentist and the best intentions, a tooth is nonrestorable. Ideally, you should have had a crown on this tooth right after the root canal, (was this done/recommended) this is a way to avoid loosing more strucure. If a tooth is broken or decayed below the gum line it typically cant be saved. I cant say for sure what I would do if you were my patient as I do not know the entire history and cant see your tooth. If you fear you are being told this because for some reason this dentist can't fix your tooth or just doesnt want to for some reason, I would recommend a second opinion. Find a friend who is happy with their dentist and make an appointment for a consultation regarding this tooth. GOOD LUCK!

The stomach is the hardest area to get rid of it seems!  \\n\\nFirst off, please know that spot reducing is not possible. If it were possible to make an area lean by always working it, typists would all have super thin fingers! (which, sadly is not the case:) )\\n\\nThe formula for lean abs is clean eating, and cardio. The crunches do help- they will build the lean muscle, but the purpose of resistance training is to build muscle, not burn fat. You have to turn to the fat burner of fitness- cardio.\\n\\nI would suggest working your abs every other day and use a variety of movements. An example routine would be:\\n\\n15 crunches\\n15 reverse crunches\\n15 oblique crunches (each side)\\n15 dual crunches\\nRepeat the circuit 2 times. \\n\\nFor eating- cut out the white flours, and white rices. Eat whole foods, lower in fat. Try to pair protein and carbs with veggies at your meals, and be sure to eat enough- every 3 or so hours. This will keep your metabolism high, so you burn fat. \\n\\nFrom there, do your caridio. You can swim, jog, walk, bike, use machines, box, go to classes- but try to get in 30 minutes 5-6 days a week. Push yourself to where you can't sing, but can still talk a little. This will be your personal fat burning zone. \\n\\nPut it all together, and you will have a lean midsection in no time!\\n\\nBest of luck!

Not sure what you are asking
Yes! Any Historic house will ALWAYS be a good investment. Obviously these types of houses aren't being made anymore for various reasons. First off, the manner in which these older buildings were built is no longer economically feasible. It costs way too much to build new houses with real wood and brick, as a result you see a lot of fiberboard and cheaper building materials being used in new house construction. When a new home is built, they cut many, many corners compared to how an older home was built. You've probably heard the old adage that "They don't build them like they used to". In this case it's very true! Also most older homes are made with trees from what are known as "old growth forests" instead of "new growth forests". "Old growth" wood is substantially stronger, more rugged, and even harder than "new growth" wood. Wood producers have practical run out of "old growth" (from older, mature forests) and what little is left is a lot more expensive than the more common, and softer "new growth' woods (from newer, non-mature forests). Older homes as a result are built from much better, longer lasting materials. Next, let's talk about architecture. The style of the house is a product of the time during which it was built. Naturally, as times have changed so have the styles of newer buildings. What I'm trying to get at is that older homes are time capsules of bygone eras! In the same way that antique furniture is highly sought after and prized, so too will older, historical homes be sought after and prized (if the haven't been already). Older homes are rarer and harder to come by, and so over time should be worth considerably more than newer homes. Older homes, closer to the center of a town (downtown), usually go through what is known as "GENTRIFICATION" at some point. Please google, er um, I mean yahoo this term. All older neighborhoods experience gentrification at some point, the main question is WHEN! If your lucky enough to own the property before gentrification hits you'll be able to ride the wave of prosperity that it'll create (as well as the higher property tax bill)! Georgia is no exception when it comes to gentrification. By the way, just so you know I practice what I preach. I live in a 90 year old beauty in an older San Antonio neighborhood just north of downtown. My property's value has DOUBLED in the last five due to a renewed interest in the area (gentrification). Why, the property's value has increased 10% in the first quarter of 2006 alone! \\n\\n      Rentals are almost always serious money producers. If you have 3-5 units and if you play it right, your tenants can pay off most of your mortgage for you! On my property, the car garage in the back was converted into a small apartment by the previous owners. I collect enough rent from the person I leased it out to, to pay for 3/4s of my mortgage payment! Rentals are definitely good!\\n   \\n      As to what one should look for, I'd say that the basics are important. Make sure that the foundation of the house is solid, since foundation repairs can cost tens of thousands of dollars to repair. Make sure that the electrical wiring has been updated (a definite must), that the plumbing is in good repair, and that the roof is in good shape, that the A/C and heating works well, etc. Basicly, you don't want to buy a house that needs more repairs than it's worth. Also look to see what's around your neighborhood that would help to improve the quality of life of anyone who live there. Are there lots of restaurants, shopping centers, parks, museums, movie theaters, librarys, schools, colleges, etc. In my case there are three universities nearby, two city parks, and plenty of shopping centers and restaurants. I hope this has helped you.
I believe that the ban only applies to minor league baseball - the use of both chewing and smoking tobacco was banned beginning on June 15, 1993. (see link below) As you'll see in that article, the major league's players' collective bargaining agreement was seen as likely to block any efforts to institute a similar ban in the majors - in fact, the anti-tobacco regulations for minor leagues were written specifically to exclude any major league players who might be relegated to a minor league club on rehabilitation.\\n\\nThe NCAA banned smokeless tobacco in 1994, but one estimate suggests that 40% of all college baseball players are in violation of the rule.

I hate to say it, but how people look at interacial relationships will differ greatly from place to place. I personaly have no problem, and think that interacial relationships help broaden the perspectives of both individuals.  There will always be people against it, and it's hardest when one of your family members is truly against it.  All I can say is that if you love the other person it can be great, but stay light hearted with other people and understand that there are a**holes and there are open minded people.

In general, no, you don't need to pay off your old loans before you can borrow new ones.  In certain cases, your repayment status can affect whether you will be allowed to borrow new loans at your new school.  If you are in default on any federal loans, you need to resolve the default before you can get any new federal loans.  However, resolving your default typically entails making 6 months of on-time payments -- but not paying the loan off completely.\\n\\nIf you didn't default on the old loans -- if you're making payments when required, etc. -- you should be fine to borrow new ones. The only exception to this would be if, somehow, you have exceeded the aggregate debt limit for that loan type.  The undergraduate *Stafford* loan limit for dependent students is $23,000 (the limit for independent students is $46,000).  Do you currently owe that much?  If not, you'll be fine.\\n\\nJust file the FAFSA online at http://www.fafsa.ed.gov. When it is processed, you will receive a Student Aid Report (SAR) with the results -- the Comments section will let you know if there are eligibility issues that you need to tend to.

The great thing about America is that laws can be changed to reflect evolving societal standards.  That's why there are Amendments to our Constitution.\\n\\nRemember that the 18th Amendment made sale and transport of "intoxicating liquors" -unconstitutional- in 1919. It was repealed by the 21st Amendment in 1933, thus making liquor sale and transport -constitutional-, once again.\\n\\nOf course, making a student-led prayer at school functions constitutional would require "an act of Congress", both literally and figuratively..but it could happen.\\n\\nNote that if Congress wants to reenact a law the Supreme Court has found unconstitutional, they can try to amend the Constitution — no easy feat, since an Amendment must be passed by two-thirds of both the Senate and the House, and then voted on by the states.\\n\\nEven the Supreme Court has reversed decisions.  Why do you think there's all the hoopla about a new conservative bent in the high court?  The fear that Roe vs. Wade will be reversed is on the mind of every pro-choice individual in the country.\\n\\nLaws are constantly being re-interpreted or changed.

Cocaine is the most addictive (and most dangerous) drug.  It is an alkaloid found in leaves of the South American shrub Erythroxylon coca. It is a powerfully reinforcing psychostimulant. The drug induces a sense of exhilaration in the user primarily by blocking the reuptake of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the midbrain.  As a rule of thumb, it is EXTREMELY unwise to experiment with cocaine.  Scientists have found that the pleasure receptors in the brain experience ONE HUNDRED TIMES more stimulation when using cocaine than when having an orgasm!  Now that's a lot of pleasure!!!  Imagine how addicted you would be if you ever experienced anything like it!  Not to mention that it ruins your life, because nothing will ever bring you as much joy as it used to, now that you've experienced the new high.\\n\\nBut yeah, the answer to your question is crack cocaine.

I have a 3Com Super Stacker II 24 port hub added to increase the number of ethernet ports from 4 ports on board to 3 on board the router and 23 port usable on the hub, for a total of 26 usable port to my LAN. These are available used for about $20.
"Certain" means sure or absolute, as in "I am certain this is the correct answer.  "Certain" can also mean a particular thing, as in "I own a certain guitar".\\n\\nDo you feel certain you have it now?

Piccadilly (pĭk'ədĭl'ē) , street of the City of Westminster borough, London, England. Starting at Piccadilly Circus (London's center of traffic and amusement), it runs to Hyde Park Corner. The street is lined with shops, hotels, and clubs. The Albany, a club, was the residence of T. B. Macaulay, W. E. Gladstone, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, and George Canning.\\n\\nThe name arises from a tailor named Robert Baker, who owned a shop in The Strand in the late 16th century and early 17th century. He amassed a large fortune by making and selling picadils (stiff collars with scalloped edges and a broad laced or perforated border), that were then in fashion. With his great fortune he purchased a large tract of what was then open country to the west of London and in about 1612 he built a large house there. The mansion soon became known as Piccadilly Hall.\\n\\nThere was a British film made in 1929 called "Piccadilly".\\n\\n\\nPiccadilly is a major London street, running from Hyde Park Corner in the west to Piccadilly Circus in the east. The street is part of the A4 road, London's main western artery, and runs alongside a number of famous buildings and sites, including Green Park.\\n\\nIt is the location of Fortnum & Mason, the Royal Academy and The Ritz Hotel. Simpson, once amongst the nation's leading clothing stores, opened on Piccadilly in the 1930s. The store closed in 1999 and the site is now occupied by the booksellers Waterstones.\\n\\nThe Piccadilly Line of the London Underground takes its name from Piccadilly and part of the line travels under Piccadilly. Green Park, Hyde Park Corner and Piccadilly Circus tube stations all have entrances either on or near to Piccadilly.\\n\\n\\nPiccadilly (1929) was a British film directed by Ewald André Dupont, written by Arnold Bennett and starring Anna May Wong, Gilda Gray and Jameson Thomas. It has been re-released by Milestone Films after an extensive restoration. It appeared in theatres in 2004 at film festivals nationwide, and in 2005 it was released on DVD.

Democrats won both the House and Senate. Is that what you wanted to know?
Yes, you are right.  And, it was on Mt. Moriah.  This is where the Temple was later built.  It was all the same place.  The rock Abraham put his son on is the rock in the now present Dome of the Rock.\\n\\nInteresting question---------and an unusual one!  That is nice.
Rearrange them to x^3 + 3x^2 -4x -12 = 0\\n\\nThen group the first 2 and the second 2\\n\\n(x^3+3x^2) + (-4x - 12) = 0\\n\\nFrom the first group, you can pull out x^2; from the second group, you can pull out -4\\n\\nx^2*(x+3) -4*(x+3) = 0\\n\\nNow you can pull out (x+3)\\n\\n(x+3)(x^2-4) = 0 --- now x^2 - 4 is a difference of squares, which are factored a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b) so you can factor x^2-4 even further\\n\\n(x+3)(x+4)(x-4)=0
Where is the angle Θ?  Is it at the origin, or is it one of the sides of the trapezoid?\\n\\nEdit: from your description, it sounds like Θ is at the origin.  And the point at the upper right of the trapezoid would be (x,y).  This point is also (sin(Θ), cos(Θ))\\n\\nYou have an isosceles trapezoid formed by the points (1,0), (x, y), (-x, y), (-1, 0).  And x = cos(Θ), y = sin(Θ).\\n\\nThe area of a trapezoid is given by the formula:\\n(b1 + b2)/2 * h\\n\\nIn your case:\\nBase 1 goes from from (-1,0) to (1,0) for a length of 2.\\nBase 2 goes from (-x,y) to (x,y) for a length of 2x or 2 cos(Θ).\\n\\nSo the average of these two:\\n (2 + 2 cos(Θ))/2\\n= 1 + cos(Θ)\\n\\nAnd the height is y or just sin(Θ).\\n\\nSo putting it all together, a formula for the area of your trapezoid is:\\n\\nf(Θ) = sin(Θ) * (1 + cos(Θ) )\\n\\nAs requested, there is part (a)...\\n\\nFor part (b) ... take the derivative and set it to zero.  You will get a Θ between 0° and 90° (π/2 radians)... I suspect that the maximum area will be at Θ = 60° (π/3 radians).  Just thinking about it visually, that would be the top half of a regular hexagon...

I worked in a Steel Foundry.  It would take a temperature of about 2700 degrees F to completely melt steel.  It took a temperature of just over 3000 degree F to boil it.\\n\\nNow as for just heating it up to break it, that would be the temperature of the ovens where they put the steel in to heat treat it so that its glowing red and then before you put it in water or oil.  That temperature is around 1500 degrees F if I remember.  They used to break off unwanted parts of the casting at this temperature.\\n\\nDo, I google search on Heat treating Steel to get your temperature(that wasn't my department)\\n\\nP.S.  If your trying to get in a safe, use a plasma cutter.  It works better, lol

Hey Jodie, I thought you were supposed to be really smart.  Hydrogen is a gas.  Pi is an abstract concept (the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle).  Multiplying them makes no sense.  \\nIt's kind of like asking what is a cardboard box times anxiety.\\n\\nYes, I sort of figured you weren't the real Jodie Foster (I agree, she is great though).

Yes, but not due to hydrogen cells or pollution. Mainly it's increasing population pressure that will make water more valuable. I don't think that we'll reach the point of actually trading water like gold, but there are stocks which are sensitive to the demand for water. Powershares has a new "Water resources" ETF which tracks companies that provide the equipment to develop water resources: PHO. It was doing well for a while, until the recent market correction. Now it's back to its price about 5 months ago.

Science is not sure about the real nature of space. It's an old question: If you remove *everything* from inside a glass, would the walls touch each other? So can you remove space from inside the glass?\\n\\nIs a vacuum really empty? We know that there are on a quantum level things like so called vacuum fluctuations. The uncertainty of energy and time allows it for a very short ammount of time to borrow energy from nothing to create a pair of a particle and it's antiparticle, if they annihilate fast enough and give the "borrowed" energy back. This is experimentally confirmed and happens all the time.\\n\\nSo we can not create a vacuum as the "absence of everything".\\n\\nIn cosmology scientists had the idea of a "false vacuum" which would be a vacuum which is not in the lowest possible energy state. So you see even the word vacuum is not as simple as it seems.\\n\\nThe problem is, as you have realized: We don't know what space is made of, especially on a microscopic level. We need to "marry" quantum mechanics with Einsteins general theory of relativism, which would give a quantum theory of gravitation.\\n\\nUp to now no one was able to do that, there are some fundamental problems. But we have some approaches, one is for example the quantum loop theory which says that space on a very microscopic level has a foam like structure, another one are the super string theories, which say that particles are vibrating strings in a much higher dimensional space (the higer dimensions hve not "unrolled" and are attached to every point in space), but none of them has been experimental tested up to now.\\n\\nSo the answer to your question is simple: We don't know, but we're working on that.

Indeed some do as stated above, usually due to the accretion forces of a supermassive black hole, like the 200,000 solar mass one at the center of our galaxy, or the 2,000,000 solar mass one at the center of galaxy M87. Surrounding them are dead stars in the form of dwarves, or even some very ancient population II stars.\\n\\nA few things that were incorrectly stated, are that galactic rotation CAN be measured, but it is immensely slow (we are talking one rotation across maybe a couple hundred million years or so, for small galaxies).  Considering that our average-sized milky way is 35,000 light years across, travelling linearly down the center, it would take our sun (going 60,000 km/h) 630,000,000 years to reach the other side. Since it is travelling circularly, it would take something closer to a billion or so years. Likely our solar system has completed about one or two "galactic years," but it is a slow, slow process.\\n\\nFurthermore, not all galaxies rotate, however. Newer galaxies, such as clusters, have no center point nor supermassive black hole, so they are for the most part stationary in terms of rotation.\\n\\nThe blackhole at the center of our galaxy, as I state above, is closer to 200,000 times the mass of our sun, not the giant underestimation of 1000 times as stated above.\\n\\nAnd despite what is says below there isn't a "blackhole at the center of our universe." They are the centroids of galaxies, not the universe. There is no central, universal rotation point as such. Also the explanation below fails to explain why galaxies are denser in their centers - and even then some aren't. Yet the user still complains about other answers' inaccuracies...

Everyone likes Brasil because they don't know any other team or players and say to themselves, "hey other idiots like Brasil, so they must be good." People who actually know about football have their own pick to win it, not some band wagon pick that most of the population in the Americas have picked. And anyone who has half a brain knows that there is a big chance that Brasil won't win it all.

First of I would like to say......"I am proud of you!" So many people come here and expect everyone else to learn to speak their language and to have all signs, paperwork, groceries etc put into their language instead of learning to speak English. I think that if you want to live here, you need to learn the language. \\n\\n1. See if your local library has tapes/CDs that you can check out for learning English. If you don't see any, than ask the librarian if they can get them for you. Many times they can borrow them from another library.\\n\\n2. You can purchase language CDs from bookstores or online.\\n\\n3. Check out your local community colleges to see if they have any classes.\\n\\n4. Check out sites online. There are some sites that will help you for free and also some that you can pay to get help.\\n\\n5. Watch TV and listen to the radio as much as possile. \\n\\n6. Go on chat sites and find people that are willing to help you. \\n\\n\\nHere are some tips for learning English \\n\\nSpeak English as much as possible during school and try to make friends with students of other nationalities.\\n\\nRecognize that you might go through a “silent period” while you are learning a new language. Most learners do. During this time, you are listening to the sounds of the language before attempting to speak it. This period can last up to several months and it is a normal part of language learning.\\n\\nBecome involved in extra-curricular activities (athletics, drama, clubs, etc.). Involvement in school activities will help you become confident in English. It is a great way to make new friends, too!\\n\\n\\nGood Luck! *Hugs*\\n\\nS.S.

there are really lots of variables the size of the ad will it be in full color will there be multiple listings also the yellow pages are very expensive my ads (small) cost me about 800$ a year, try getting a website it seems to me more people are using the web more than ever, but you might have the guy come out and show you what they can do for how much you wont be obligated you might get a few phone calls from them you also need to know when the deadline is they only print once a year. i change my ads to the yellow book they were much cheaper they put you on the website and give you multiple listings
Also known as Rest Cramps. Especially in older adults, cramps at rest (often during the night) are very common. Rest cramps may be experienced at any age, however, including during childhood. While not life-threatening, night cramps can be very disruptive of sleep and otherwise quite disturbing. They sometimes recur frequently (that is, many times a night, and/or many nights each week) and are very painful. The actual cause of night cramps is unknown. Sometimes, such cramps seem to be initiated by making a movement that shortens the muscle, which then cramps. An example is pointing the toe down while lying in bed, which shortens the calf muscle, a common site of cramps.

Nothing happens until something is sold. Marketing is the means by which things are sold. Some people confuse marketing and sales. Sales is part of marketing and the sale is the ultimate goal, but they are different. Marketing involves all the psychology and attributes needed to get a product or service to the market and into the consumers hands. It is probably the most important part of business. Marketing involves research, advertising and sales. Most of your top executives come from a marketing background.

I don't say that this practice is 0%here, but it mostly prevails in the Muslim dominated areas of India. I do not blame Muslims for this, neither do I abuse them for the same, but it is so. And what I say is true, 'coz I am am an INDIAN. Here, the entire lives of people is dedicated to taking care of thein children. Those who have such habits, are simply boycoted.

Dogs don't think that way. You're projecting human thought patterns and behaviours onto animals, and that's simply not how their mind works. I read a great article about a month ago (I forget where) about an animal psychologist talking about this sort of thing, how a lot of problems with pets are caused by thinking about them in human terms. For example, one woman's dog started causing havok when she got a full-time job and left him home in the house. She thought he was angry at her, but that's not something dogs could even comprehend. No, it was rather that the dog was simply very confused and didn't understand what was going on, and figuring this out saved the dog from having to be put down (he almost bit someone).\\n\\nBasically, no. Chimpanzees and other such evolutionary cousins might, but your common house pets cannot think that way.
Because some people believe in their god so strongly that they cant have an open mind that possibly they could be wrong. I am not trying to put anyone down and do not want to be preached at, for Ive been there and done that. \\n It's just that some people don't want to admit that there could be some other explanation other than their god.

Normally it is set up like the NFL's where the top four teams get a bye, with 5vs12, 6vs11 and so.  The winner of the 5vs12 team would play the fourth team, while the winner of 6vs11 plays the third and so on.  The other option is to allow those four teams a bye, and reseed immideately after the first round.

You can try managing your time by prioritizing by importance and/or deadline.  You can start attending to requirements that are due at an earlier date.  It also helps if you regularly study as compared to studying (or craming) for a test the night before, because you are always prepared.  It will also be a good idea to start right away when projects are given, as also not to cram.  You'll feel less stressed.\\n\\nThere is no best time management for everyone.  Each one has his own time management technique, so try and find your own style that works best for you.\\n\\nI hope this helps!  Good luck!
BLACK FRIDAY (SHOPPING) - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_Sale\\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\\n\\nBlack Friday, the day after Thanksgiving in the United States, is historically one of the busiest retail shopping days of the year. Many consider it the "official" beginning to the holiday season. Most retailers will open very early and usually provide massive discounts on their products.\\n\\nAlthough Black Friday is typically the busiest shopping day of the year in terms of customer traffic, it is not typically the day with the highest sales volume. That is usually either Christmas Eve or the last Saturday before Christmas.\\n\\nOrigin\\n\\nThe first use of this term to describe the day after Thanksgiving is not exactly known. There are two popular theories as to its origin.\\n\\nAccounting practice\\n\\nOne theory is that stores traditionally operated at a financial loss for most of the year (January through November) and made their profit during the holiday season. When this would be recorded in the financial records, common accounting practices use red ink to show negative amounts and black ink would show positive amounts. Black Friday is the beginning of the period where they would no longer have losses (the red) and instead take in the year's profits (the black).\\n\\nStress from large crowds\\n\\nAnother theory comes from the fact that shopping experience on this day can be extremely stressful. The term is used as a comparison to the extremely stressful and chaotic experience of Black Thursday or other black days. According to The Word Spy:\\n\\nEarliest Citation:\\nChristmas decorations around Tampa Bay started going up in late October, and business has been brisk since then. And while Friday--known as Black Friday for the legendary hordes--will be the biggest shopping day for many area stores, others ring up the greatest sales the Saturday before Christmas.\\n—Marilyn Marks, "Retailers expect good sales this Christmas," St. Petersburg Times, November 27, 1986\\n\\nThere exists an earlier reference, speaking to the Friday after Thanksgiving:\\n\\nA BLACK FRIDAY.\\nThere have been many Black Fridays in recent history. Most of them have been days of financial panic. There has been none of blacker foreboding than last Friday. And the blackness is not loss or fear of loss in stocks and bonds.\\nNew York Times (1857-Current file).\\nNew York, N.Y.: Dec 3, 1922. pg. 38, 1 pgs\\nISSN/ISBN 03624331\\n\\nEmployees of retail stores have for years referred to Black Friday in a satirical way, to note the extremely stressful and hectic nature of the day. Heavy traffic and customer demands added to the long hours make it a difficult day.\\n\\n\\nBlack Friday on the Internet\\n\\nAdvertisements in advance\\n\\nCertain websites such as DealTaker.com offer information about Black Friday deals up to a month in advance. The text listings of prices are usually accompanied by adscans -- complete PDFs either leaked by insiders, or intentionally released by large retailers to give consumers insight and allow them time to plan.\\n\\nCyber Monday\\n\\nThe term Cyber Monday refers to the Monday immediately following Black Friday, which unofficially marks the beginning of the holiday online shopping season.\\n\\nIn recent years, Cyber Monday has become a busy day for online retailers, with some sites offering low prices and other promotions on that day.\\n\\nControversy\\n\\nResponse (Buy Nothing Day)\\n\\nAnti-consumer frenzy protesters have chosen this day as Buy Nothing Day in North America, where those concerned about the increasing power and influence of consumer corporations are urged to not make consumer purchases.\\n\\nDMCA\\n\\nIn recent years, some retailers (including Wal-Mart, Target Corporation, Best Buy, and Staples, Inc.) have claimed that the advertisements they send in advance of Black Friday and the prices included in those advertisement are intellectual property and protected by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).\\n\\nUsing the t
A good place to start would be the Shanghai area since you are going there. There are loads of factories around the area: Wenzhou, Zhejiang, Suzhou (there is a huge furniture place there - more than 10 huge malls on one street and you can take more than a couple of days just to view it) etc. \\n\\nAs for container pricing, it really depends on how much you need....there is a bulk discount if you do it in bulk. All the factories will know how to do it when you talk to them. Now...here is one important tip...everything a chinese manufacturer says is up for negotiations...EVERYTHING. Make sure you get all your tax numbers and export documents sorted out - especially for the UK side. \\n\\nThe Import/Export business is rather physically demanding here as you need someone around in China to make sure that everything goes smoothly. I am personally not in your line (more textiles) but I think that all exports work the same way. \\n\\nHope this helps

There are many rich people out there who want to help poor people.  But I have never heard of any rich person that individuals can write to for money.  Rich people usually donate to organizations, and these organizations help mostly people in desperate circumstances, who are staving or homeless or owing hundreds of thousands in doctor bills for their kids.  I don't think there is any organization that gives money to people like you. \\n\\nIf you need help, you can contact food banks in your area or talk to people at your place of worship.  Consider getting a loan, if possible.  \\n\\nPlease don't spend much time trying to hunt for these mythical "philanthropists".  They don't exist.
Well, not sure if this can be applied in all situations but your question reminded me of this response I got from an email that still cracks me up:\\n\\nWhat to say to a telemarketer! One of the things that has always bugged me (and I'm sure it has most of you, too) is to sit down to dinner only to be interrupted by a phone call from a telemarketer. I decided, on one such occasion, to try to be as irritating to them as they were to me. The call was from AT&T, and it went something like this: \\n\\nMe: Hello\\n\\nAT&T: Hello, this is AT&T.... \\n\\nMe: Is this AT&T?\\n\\nAT&T: Yes, this is AT&T.... \\n\\nMe: This is AT&T?\\n\\nAT&T: Yes. This is AT&T.... \\n\\nMe: Is this AT&T?\\n\\nAT&T: YES! This is AT&T. May I speak to Mr. Salem please? \\n\\nMe: May I ask who is calling?\\n\\nAT&T: This is AT&T. \\n\\nMe: OK, hold on. \\n\\nAt this point, I put the phone down for a solid 5 minutes thinking that, surely, this person would have hung up the phone. I ate my salad. Much to my surprise, when I picked up the receiver, she was still waiting. \\n\\nMe: Hello?\\n\\nAT&T: Is this Mr. Salem? \\n\\nMe: May I ask who is calling please?\\n\\nAT&T: Yes, this is AT&T.... \\n\\nMe: Is this AT&T?\\n\\nAT&T: Yes, this is AT&T.... \\n\\nMe: This is AT&T?\\n\\nAT&T: Yes, is this Mr. Salem? \\n\\nMe: Yes, is this AT&T?\\n\\nAT&T: Yes, sir. \\n\\nMe: The phone company?\\n\\nAT&T: Yes, sir. \\n\\nMe: I thought you said this was AT&T.\\n\\nAT&T: Yes, sir, we are a phone company. \\n\\nMe: I already have a phone.\\n\\nAT&T: We aren't selling phones today, Mr. Salem. \\n\\nMe: Well, whatever it is, I'm really not interested, but thanks for calling. \\n\\nWhen you are not interested in something, I don't think you can express yourself any plainer than by saying "I'm really not interested", but this lady was persistent. \\n\\nAT&T: Mr. Salem, we would like to offer you 10 cents a minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. \\n\\nNow, I am sure she meant she was offering a "rate" of 10 cents a minute, but she at no time used the word "rate". I could clearly see that it was time to whip out the trusty old calculator and do a little ciphering. \\n\\nMe: Now, that's 10 cents a minute 24 hours a day? AT&T: (getting a little excited at this point by my interest) Yes, sir, that's right! 24 hours a day! \\n\\nMe: 7 days a week?\\n\\nAT&T: That's right. \\n\\nMe: 365 days a year?\\n\\nAT&T: Yes, sir. \\n\\nMe: I am definitely interested in that! Wow!! That's amazing!! AT&T: We think so! \\n\\nMe: That's quite a sum of money!\\n\\nAT&T: Yes, sir, it's amazing how it adds up. \\n\\nMe: OK, so will you send me checks weekly, monthly or just one big one at the end of the year for the full $52,560? If you send an annual heck, can I get a\\n\\ncash advance?\\n\\nAT&T: Excuse me? \\n\\nMe: You know, the 10 cents a minute.\\n\\nAT&T: What are you talking about? \\n\\nMe: You said you'd give me 10 cents a minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. That comes to $144 per day, $1,008 per week and $52,560 per year. I'm just interested in knowing how you will be making payment.\\n\\nAT&T: Oh no, sir, I didn't mean we'd be paying you. You pay us 10 cents a minute. \\n\\nMe: Wait a minute here! Didn't you say you'd give me 10 cents a minute? Are you sure this is AT&T?\\n\\nAT&T: Well, yes, this is AT&T, sir, but.... \\n\\nMe: But nothing! How do you figure that by saying that you'll give me 10 cents a minute that I'll give you 10 cents a minute? Is this some kind of suliminal telemarketing scheme? I've read about things like this in the Enquirer, you know. Don't use your alien brainwashing techniques on me.\\n\\nAT&T: No, sir, we are offering 10 cents a minute for.... \\n\\nMe: THERE YOU GO AGAIN! Can I speak to a supervisor please?!? AT&T: Sir, I don't think that is necessary. \\n\\nMe: Sure! You say that now! What happens later? AT&T: What? \\n\\nMe: I insist on speaking to a supervisor! AT&T: Yes, Mr. Salem. Please hold. \\n\\nSo, now AT&T has
It's because Wiccans don't judge other religions the way Christians do.  They believe all religions are correct in their own way and that as long as you are living a good life and not harming others - there is nothing wrong with what you choose to believe.  Christians on the other hand - believe it's their way or the highway.  They think they are right and everyone else is wrong and anyone who doesn't believe what they believe is going to hell.  Basically - they're hypocrites.

I think you mean "adze."  It's a tool:\\nThe tool known as the adze [pronounced adds] serves for smoothing rough-cut wood in hand woodworking. Generally, the user stands astride a board or log and swings the adze downwards towards their feet, chipping off a piece of wood, and walking backwards as they go, leaving a relatively smooth surface behind. However, in general usage, the adze can be used for other cutting operations.\\n\\nThe head of the adze is oriented to the haft like a hoe, or plane, and not like an axe, whose cutting blade would be perpendicular to the blade of an adze.

All sports, including college, are all about the money.  With the amount of loyalty franchises seem to show players that have given the best of their careers to them it is no wonder that athletes have become money first.  In an erra when Mike Piazza can become a Met or Junio Seau can become a Dolphin I personally don't blame athletes for being "me first".\\n\\nThe only difference in college sports is that the stars don't get a piece of the unbelievable amounts of money.

Let's denote the number of fish he caught on day 1 as x.  Thus, here are the totals for each day:\\n\\nday 1 = x\\nday 2 = x+3\\nday 3 = x+6\\nday 4 = x+9\\nday 5 = x+12\\nday 6 = x+15\\nday 7 = x+18\\nday 8 = x+21\\nday 9 = x+24\\nday 10 = x+27\\nday 11 = x+30\\nday 12 = x+33\\nday 13 = x+36\\nday 14 = x+39\\n\\nAdding these together will get you the total fish = 385.  Solving, you get:\\n\\n14x + 273 = 385\\n\\nSolving, you get x = 8\\n\\nThus, these are the totals he caught each day:\\n\\nday 1 = 8\\nday 2 = 11\\nday 3 = 14\\nday 4 = 17\\nday 5 = 20\\nday 6 = 23\\nday 7 = 26\\nday 8 = 29\\nday 9 = 32\\nday 10 = 35\\nday 11 = 38\\nday 12 = 41\\nday 13 = 44\\nday 14 = 47\\n\\n---------------\\n\\nHope this helps

Trinitarians love to regurgitate philosophy, Greek, , and quotes from other Babylon-loving Trinitarians.

I've heard about 4 days.\\n\\nWhen I quit smoking several years ago... here's what I did.  I took a two liter bottle of water and went into a sauna.  I kept on drinking water.  When I started to sweat heavily, I would exit the sauna and take a quick shower... rinsing the sweat off of me.  \\n\\nI would then return to the sauna and repeat the procedure until I had drank all the water.\\n\\nI felt great!  That first day went fairly easily.  The next day was pure torture.  I think I sweated out all the nicotine that first day and had massive withdrawels on the second.  Still, my withdrawel lasted a much shorter time than other times I attempting quitting.\\n\\nGood luck!

Ocean surface waves are surface waves which occur at the surface of an ocean. They are mechanical waves that propagate along the interface between water and air; the restoring force is provided by gravity, and so they are often referred to as surface gravity waves. As the wind blows, pressure and friction forces perturb the equilibrium of the ocean surface. These forces transfer energy from the air to the water, forming waves. In the case of monochromatic linear plane waves in deep water, particles near the surface move in circular paths, making ocean surface waves a combination of longitudinal (back and forth) and transverse (up and down) wave motions. When waves propagate in shallow water, (where the depth is less than half the wavelength) the particle trajectories are compressed into ellipses. As the wave amplitude (height) increases, the particle paths no longer form closed orbits; rather, after the passage of each crest, particles are displaced a little forward from their previous positions, a phenomenon known as Stokes drift. A good illustration of the wave motion is given by *Prof. Robert Dalrymple Java applet.

The idea of some particle having a negative charge was needed to properly explain the results of experiments performed by scientists like Thompson, Rutherford, and Bohr.  Keep in mind that no one has actually seen an electron, but it is part of the atomic theory, and it is an idea that has been proven by experimentation.  More information on atomic theory can be found here:\\n http://www.scienceclarified.com/As-Bi/Atomic-Theory.html\\n\\nHere is another link to a paper called "The Nature of Electronic Charge."  It's pretty theoretical, but perhaps it will be of use to you.\\nhttp://arxiv.org/ftp/physics/papers/0408/0408053.pdf

One thing I dislike about the Democratic party is its inability to properly organize itself and its issues.  Our population is majority democrat, but so many democrats cannot or choose not to vote.  I also think that a lot of liberals have holier than thou values about Christianity (they think that the only smart people out there are atheists), which are kind of hypocritical of liberal ideals. \\n\\nI like the patriotism of a lot of Republicans.  They're really into that heartwarming, feel good to be an American stuff.  Even like the president running around with that soldier who lost his legs in Iraq.  I think that's just a pretty cool thing to do.

What does your fiancé think? - would be my main question here. Unless my fiancé was made of money, I would be extremely disappointed if he spent any significant amount of it on an item of purely symbolic value such as an engagement ring. I was much more impressed with the fact that my husband owned a home and managed his money well. But some women would rather see their husband-to-be in debt, and have a huge rock on their finger; so, it all depends.

What are you talking about? Theres already outsourcing going on and most of the ones that are creating this outsourcing are the people from India.\\n\\nSoon big companies will realize that customer satisfaction is more important to a company. Communication is key when it comes to servicing costumers. When a costumer cant understand what the heck the support person is talking about and if there is a language barrier, then it will turn costumers off. Big companies will realize that spending money on some BETTER sources for costumer support will be key to their business. \\n\\nI hope we get rid of outsourcing.\\n\\nI hate it when I'm on the phone with a tech support and they cant speak a word of english...or their accent is so bad, it just angers me more. I refuse to buy their product again if their customer support is THAT bad.
John Milton, in Paradise Lost said, "The mind is its own place and in itself can make a Hell of Heaven, a Heaven of Hell."  Thus, we create our own destiny anew in each and every moment.  Bitterness is a thorn deep below the skin of our consciousness that continues to fester as long as we harbor it.  To be free, one must let go of the past and take responsibility for their feelings and their actions.  It is irresponsible to blame one's feelings on another.  Where do the feelings emanate from?  Within ourselves, we create them.  Something outside may be the catalyst for such feelings, but we create them and react to our self-made feelings.  \\n     I have a question for your question - why wait until you are dead to find out?  Why not try to be free from our self-created suffering and live in peace right this second?\\n\\n  As the maxim goes:  To err is human.  To forgive, divine.

It all depends on the lie and the deepness or flatness of the bunker. Mostly you would use a sand wedge, but I have seen pro's putt out of a green side bunker. It also depends on where the bunker is. If it is a fairway bunker, you may choose any iron and again, I have seen pro's hit a wood out of a bunker if the lie is good and they have quite a distance to the green.

If I understand your question: Wrinkles can generally form when the material is in compression - it is a form of buckling, so try looking up 'buckling' or instability as a topic.  Plastics are not isotropic and exhibit different properties in different directions.  (Metals, in contrast, can be isotropic, but are subject to Poisson's ratio and exhibit different behavior depending on "plane stress" or "plane strain" conditions.)\\n\\nPlastics for the most part are not true crystalline solids; they are viscoelastic materials with properties of directionality depending on previous processing.  For most all plastics there will be some degree of creep under tensile stress.  Relaxation of the tensile stress allows the elastic component to retract in the opposite direction of the applied tensile stress, but the plastic component (the permanent set or "visco" component) won't contract.  Meanwhile, the stress direction at 90° to the tensile stress has likely experienced less stress and so has a larger or more elastic component.  What this means is that as the tensile component exceeds the yield point, the cross direction has not, and may have a tendency to buckle in the cross direction.  It also depends on how you're holding onto the plastic when stretching (biaxial or uniaxial?).  \\n\\nSome plastics have a strong tendency to align their molecules when stretch, and become more 'crystalline' in nature.  You can see this effect by 'stress whitening' when stretching a plastic grocery shopping bag made from HDPE.\\n\\nThis is kind of a complicated materials engineering question requiring a little more detail into the stress state, the exact material, even the environmental conditions play a role (how warm is the ambient, humidity level, etc.)\\n\\nHowever, for the most part, try looking up 'buckling' because that topic may give you more insight into why the wrinkles form.

If you love him with all your heart then that's the best thing you can ever give him. As for love making, you should let him know that your sexual preferences have just become different and he should try to understand.

A reduction reaction is only half of a reaction. It must occur with an oxidation reaction to be a full reaction, to be called a redox reaction. The reduction half-reaction is one where a species gains electrons, and the oxidation half-reaction is one where a species loses electrons.
Hydrocodone is a morphine molecule with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom attached to it. Essentialy it is morphine that has to be demethylized by the liver before it attaches to opiod receptor at base of brain. The body normaly produces it's own morphine, called endomorphins. When a person is taking morphine (of any form) it precludes the need for the body to produce it's own morphine, or endomorphine, so the internal system that produces endomorphines shuts down over time. When this person stops taking morphine, they experiance all the terrible things that morphine, or endomorphine is supposed to regulate - like body temperature, intestinal motion, pain perception, dysphoria...etc, and the only way to "fix" it is to wait until the endomorphine system starts up again (several months to get back to good condition) or to take more morphine. There are treatments, called medicaly assisted therapies, wherein a patient is prescribed either methadone or suboxone to mediate the withdrawel symptoms. Suboxone is the newest. It is butyl morphine and nalaxone in a pill that one dissolves under the tungue. Butyl morphine is a partial agonist with a high affinity for receptors, so it doesn't switch on the recptors as hard as a regular opiod would, but it sticks to the receptors better than a regular opiod would. The nalaxone is a receptor blocker and only becomes bioavailable if the user crushes and injects the pill - in that case the nalaxone would clean the receptors of any and all opiods and the user would experiance full withdrawel symptoms. The net being that the user who takes suboxone doesn't really get high and if they do try to abuse other opiods they will not get any affect from them. There is also a "ceiling affect" with butyl morphine - so if you try to take a lot of it at once to get high, you don't get any additional affect after a certain amount. The addict would take suboxone for 6 months to a year and then taper off by reducing the dose by a half a milligram a week until down to nothing.
Tough call. Dealing with schoolyard bullies is one of the hardest things to learn. You _should_ talk to a teacher. The bully will see that as weakness. Bullies are usually stupid and feel inferior and have no good tools for dealing with life. Try to understand. Above all, don't lose your self respect. If you decide to fight, give no warning, just paste him as soon as he starts to hassle you. But be aware that most schools will discipline both parties in a fight, because there is no place for violence in schools. So the first thing to do is talk to a teacher or principal.
This very question was the focus of an article in Popular Mechanics about 6 months ago. The glacier in Greenland has been melting twice as fast as it was, only two years ago. The magazine predicted if all the glaciers of the world melted, the result would be a loss of a 100 miles of  coastline in from its present location, all over the world. Small islands would disappear altogether. The increase of water has resulted in a slower jet stream and cooler temperatures despite the claim of global warming. In fact, it's the greenhouse gases that are causing the glaciers to melt in the first place.

We are only beginning to be able to detect planets within an order of magnitude of the mass of Earth. Just a couple months ago, we found the smallest rocky planet yet discovered outside the solar system, orbiting a star 20,000 light years away. It's about 5 times the mass of Earth, and has a larger orbit (and orbital period), about 2.6 AU (and orbits in about 10 years). It's also very cold, about 50 K (-370 F), as it orbits a red dwarf about a fifth the mass of the sun.\\nIt was discovered with a new technique called gravitational microlensing, which can only be used occasionally. However, as this planet is one of three so far detected by microlensing, scientists think it implies that earthlike planets may be much more common than previously realized.\\n\\nThis isn't much of an answer to your question, but, honestly, the closest (non-earth) planet which is capable of sustaining intelligent life could orbit one of the two primary stars in the Alpha Centauri system (the nearest star system to the sun, at 4.3 light years away; there are three stars there, the larger Alpha Centauris A and B, and the distant companion Proxima Centauri) for all we know. The only way we'd have to find such a planet (without the presence of extremely rare astronomical conditions which allow microlensing) is the spectroscopic method, which has a difficult time finding any planets which are not a) extremely massive, and b) orbiting extremely close to their star. \\n\\nThe two primary Alpha Centauri stars could have rocky planets orbiting at less than 2 AU (Mars has an orbit of about 1.5 AU), and Alpha Centauri A is a metal rich G2 type star like our own sun, while Alpha Centauri B is a metal rich K1 star, which is in the band of spectral types which may be suitable for life-bearing planets.\\n\\nIn short, we don't know. They could be everywhere, including practically on our doorstep, or they could be relatively rare, and not found for thousands of light years from Earth. We'll have to wait until our methods of finding planets improves to know for sure.

Now Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, and she was left with her two sons. 4 They married Moabite women, one named Orpah and the other Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years, 5 both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.\\n8 Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go back, each of you, to your mother's home. May the LORD show kindness to you, as you have shown to your dead and to me. 9 May the LORD grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband." \\n      Then she kissed them and they wept aloud 10 and said to her, "We will go back with you to your people." \\n\\n 11 But Naomi said, "Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands? 12 Return home, my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me—even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons- 13 would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the LORD's hand has gone out against me!" \\n\\n 14 At this they wept again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-by, but Ruth clung to her. \\n\\n 15 "Look," said Naomi, "your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her." \\n\\n 16 But Ruth replied, "Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. 17 Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me." 18 When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her. \\n\\n 19 So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, "Can this be Naomi?" \\n\\n* she followed Naomi out of love

I worked on campus getting my undergrad and while finishing my M.Ed. I work in the schools. Stress relief is perhaps on a day off from work/school (yes i know its hard) take a break from those hours of studying if possible and go shopping or get a massage. I'd not advise it right before finals or a big project *grins* Perhaps if you go to school away from home, try to get Monday assignments done before going home for the weekend and just enjoying being with family. Be serious about your job, but if its not the area you plan to work in after college, just keep telling yourself its only for a little while. Look what I'm accomplishing and where I won't have to work until I retire. That's a stress relief in itself.
all of them and there is a choice

First off you need to ask yourself "Is this behavior that I have made acceptable view of in my house?"  Kids learn by seeing alot of the time.  Secondly remember that the years 2 & 3 are when children start to assert their independence hence the Terrible Twos.  If it is truly violent behavior do not answer in kind.  The calmer more rational you are the more calm your cild will be.  The energy you would have fed to the situation with anger is not there and it makes the situation smoother.  Now if it is simply taking toys from other children not sharing, biting, etc These are normal things that 3 year olds do.  My son bit a child at school until he broke the skin but the child smaked a toy from his hands very crudely.  And he answered back.  \\n\\nRemember to break down their behavior slowly and do not try to deconstruct them psychologically.  They are not old enough yet to have severe trauma unless their background dictates it.  Get on your 3 year olds level and speak in small concise words so that he can follow your meaning easier.  Encourage him to express feeling of anger or hurt verbally rather than physically.  When one of my boys has a problem or is upset, I ask "Does this make you mad, it's okay sometimes to be upset."  Help them get an outlet and redirect that energy into playing with another item etc.  \\n\\nI Hope This Helps,\\nAmy
It is puzzling as to why Bush's folks would so brazenly display the banner for all the world to see. Because certainly it's obvious: no weapons of mass destruction have or will be found (unless the U.S. plants them); nor did the Iraqi government use any against the United States. So that mission wasn't accomplished. And it's pretty clear that the Iraqi civilians haven't been liberated, unless you consider being shot at and killed for protesting against the United States, liberation. Or having your collective history and rich culture destroyed in a matter of weeks, liberation. Or going without sufficient food, water or medical care, liberation. Or having an interim government imposed on you, liberation. So that mission, unfortunately, wasn't accomplished either.\\nPretty pathetic scorecard. But certainly if Karl Rove decided to parade the banner "Mission Accomplished," they had to have accomplished something. So as Mr. Bush dragged on with his insipid speech, one would continue ponder what exactly was the mission?  And then it hits, as clear as day, or rather, as "black" as night: the oil! the Texas tea! the Bush-Cheney life-blood! Mission CERTAINLY was accomplished!!!!!!!!

Salivary gland tumors comprise less than 3% of head & neck tumors.  Between 75% and 85% are in the parotid gland and approximately 70% of those are benign mixed tumors (pleomorphic adenomas).  Tumors may be benign or malignant and occur in the parotid, the submandibular salivary gland, or in the minor salivary glands found in the lining of the oral cavity.
well, you've got the frist thing right: you want to.  that's a huge step in the right direction.  get a notebook for each class, and take notes on what the teacher says.  review the days lessons each night before you go to bed.  keep track of when homework is due and when tests are so you can be prepared.\\nsecondly, you need to realize that you're not perfect, and I hope your parents realize this, too.  you're not going to get 100% on every single thing you hand in.  there will be subjects that are hard for you.  accept it and do your best, there's nothing wrong with not being perfect.\\nthirdly, understand that many other students aren't going to feel the same as you.  they'll want to play and waste time while you're studying.  they will probably try to get you to follow them, and they may be mean and make fun of you for your hard work and good grades.  this hurts, but ignore them, they're the ones who are going to end up in dead-end jobs while you've got a good job.
Why?
Maid Marian is the female companion to the legendary figure Robin Hood.\\n\\nThe earliest Medieval Robin Hood stories gave him no female companion. The Robin Hood character at this time was rather brutish woodsman and a female companion would have been out of place.\\n\\nMaid Marian was originally a character in May Games festivities (held during May and early June, most commonly around Whitsun) and is sometimes associated with the Queen or Lady of May of May Day. It has been suggested that she became associated with Robin Hood in this context, as Robin Hood became a central figure in May Day, associated as it was with the forest and archery.\\n\\nMarian is likely derived from the French tradition of a shepherdess named Marion and her shepherd lover Robin (not Robin Hood). The best known example of this tradition is Adam de la Halle's Le Jeu du Robin et Marion, circa 1283.\\n\\nIn narrative terms, Maid Marian was first attached to Robin Hood in the late sixteenth century as Robin was gentrified and given a virginal maid to pine after. Her biography and character have been highly variable over the centuries, being sometimes portrayed as a pagan or Saxon and other times as a high born Norman. (Marian's role was not entirely virginal in the early days. In 1592, Thomas Nashe described the Marian of the later May Games as being played by a male actor named Martin, and there are hints in the play of Robin Hood and the Friar that the female character in these plays had become a lewd parody.)\\n\\nMaid Marian's character evolved, becoming conflated with the Goddess Diana as she became portrayed as a skilled huntress that fought alongside Robin. In the Victorian Era she reverted to her previous role as the dainty maid. With the rise of modern feminism in the 20th century, the character has often been depicted as an adventurer again, sometimes as a crack archer herself. In modern times, a common ending for Robin Hood stories became that he married Maid Marian and left the woods for a civilized aristocratic life. See also Maid Marian and Her Merry Men for a modern role reversal.
One thing that is especially important in writing to the employer is knowing a little about the company so that you can logically tailor your words to the position and the organization. Do some research and share what you have learned in an engaging way. \\n\\nWhen your resume and cover letter first reach the prospective employer, the employer will start to form an opinion about you. How professional are you? Are you detail-oriented, ambitious, responsible and/or qualified for the job? \\n\\nWriting a good cover letter entails thought and time. Map out the information you want to place in each section, then go back through and fine tune it. Don’t try to write brilliantly from the salutation to the signature in the first draft. Revise it each time you go through it. \\n\\nMost of all show the employer why you are the best person for the job. Indicate how you will contribute immediately to current projects by emphasizing your qualifications and determination to succeed. Let the employer know that you aren’t just another applicant. You are the one to fill the position.

If a person can trace their family history back far enough they will usually come across one or more cousin marriages in their tree.  First, until almost 1870-1880 is was socially acceptable.  Second the further you go back in history the less likely someone was going to marry outside of their community because people just couldn't meet people from other communities very easily and third it was sometimes even encouraged especially when a family was in a certain social group.\\n\\nThe reason cousin marriages are discouraged is because if there is defective gene the chances of inbreeding that one gene is higher when you marry within a certain degree of family;  if the genes are clean then there is nothing biologically wrong but in today's society most marriages below that of third cousins are considered unacceptable.

First off, Incredimail works like any other external e-mail program like Outlook Express, for example, in that you need an e-mail service that supports a 3rd party program to send and receive.  You have to configure your POP3 and STMP information along with your authentication.  Services such as Yahoo and Hotmail do not support this feature, therefore Incredimail won't work if you are using it for your Yahoo mail.\\n\\nIf you are trying to send and receive mail with a regular POP account, contact your e-mail provider and get the correct configuration information (this is usually available on their website).\\n\\nThe information you are looking for should be something like this...\\n\\nAccount:\\nPassword:\\nIncoming mail POP3 settings:\\nOutgoing mail SMTP settings:\\nMy server requires SMTP authentication:

On December 1, 1998, Exxon and Mobil first announced their intent to merge in a record-setting $80 billion stock swap.\\n\\nThe first recorded announcement of the merger was in "Offshore" magazine, volume 58 issue 12, page 119.\\n\\nOn November 30, 1999, Exxon and Mobil completed their merger, forming Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest public company in the world, Mobil shareholders own 30% of the new firm; Exxon shareholders, 70%.
During pregnancy? They'd outlaw it entirely if local governments didn't enjoy spending that tobacco settlement money. Drinking or doing drugs during pregnancy is far worse and is responsible for a lot more of the birth defects of children in special needs homes and hospitals today. When you work with these kids and think what the parents did for their own pleasure instead of just waiting a few months, it is criminal.  But don't worry, the latest bombshell from the Anglican/Episcopal church is supporting euthanesia of babies with "problems" to save money, I'm beginning to think it would be a good way to get out of paying retirement pensions for their bishops too :P

Fact is there is more than enough food produced on the planet to feed everyone. In the Untied states alone we produce 3 times the amount need to feed our people, yet there is still starvation in this country.\\n\\nThe only answer to why is politics. One side says that its wrong to just give way food, that the poor must work for it, the government has no buisness funding programs.\\n\\nOn a global scale it is much more complicated. and population is not the reason it can not be solved.\\nMajor reasons include.\\n\\n*unstable governments in the poorest nations.\\nWaring nations.\\n*Lack of Prioritization of the problem by stable rich nations.\\n*Lack of Funding to distrubute food, lack of storage facilities.\\n*Lack of evironmental regulations..(rivers and oceans, ect ect)\\n\\nBut if you want the simplest answer...is that mankind is flawed. They nation before humanity, they see borders before need. They say there is no solution so they do not try.\\nIs there a soultion to that....I am not sure.
The name Australia is derived from the Latin Australis, meaning of the South. Legends of an "unknown land of the south" (terra australis incognita) date back to the Roman times and were commonplace in mediaeval geography, but they were not based on any actual knowledge of the continent. The Dutch adjectival form Australische ("Australian", in the sense of "southern") was used by Dutch officials in Batavia to refer to the newly discovered land to the south as early as 1638. The first use of the word "Australia" in English was a 1693 translation of Les Aventures de Jacques Sadeur dans la Découverte et le Voyage de la Terre Australe, a 1692 French novel by Gabriel de Foigny under the pen name Jacques Sadeur. Alexander Dalrymple then used it in An Historical Collection of Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean, published in 1771. He used the term to refer to the entire South Pacific region, not specifically to the Australian continent. In 1793, George Shaw and Sir James Smith published Zoology and Botany of New Holland, in which they wrote of "the vast island, or rather continent, of Australia, Australasia or New Holland."
You have two strands of activity to follow at the same time in order to start a private school.\\n\\nFirst strand:  Establishing the Business\\n\\nYou will need to write a business plan (outline of your services and fees, costs, growth plan, personnel plan, etc.) and, if you need starting capital, take it to a bank for a starter loan. Probably several banks.  If you already have your seed money, or are approved for your loan, you will need to apply to the state for a business license, register with the state and federal tax departments, and obtain approval from your local government for your business location/zoning. Your local Better Business Bureau can direct you to someone who can help you with all this.\\n\\n\\nSecond strand: Obtaining a license to operate a private school from your state Department of Education, including obtaining accreditation.\\n\\nFor example, here's the information for New Mexico: http://www.ped.state.nm.us/alted/private_schools/index.html\\n\\n\\nGood luck!

The treaty was unsuccessful.They put all the blame on Germany.They did not stick to their word and give Italy the territories they wanted. By putting the entire blame on Germany and compelling them to pay a huge war indemnity they hurt the German people who suffered during the Depression.Hitler was a charismatic orator who proved to the German people that the Treaty Of Versailles was a great injustice and they followed him into war.This is how Hitler was successful in arousing German nationalism,Nazism and offcourse starting the second world war.\\n\\nPersonal opinion:Personally, I believe the Treaty was a great bane for the Germans who suffered from years of unemployment and poverty.If the conditions of the Treaty were a  little more mild the Germans would probably have not taken Hitler upon his word.

Yellow Pages!\\n Count how many buildings or floors just for culinary. Not the 4  Science buildings, with 1 floor for Engineering. And the building is still in design process, by your last year its built? that means you never took the classes.
Maybe.  It's feasible if 1) you like HOW they market, 2) you follow their process.  The critical part of any MLM is to get people to do the same thing over and over again.  This usually means there are a lot of rallys and sometimes inauthentic pep talks.  What's happening is people are replacing what large corporations have to pay to accomplish.  So, if I were Nestle, I'd have a very large marketing and advertisiting budget to tell people to buy Nestle Hot Chocolate.  But, if I'm Stevens, I get a bunch of people to tell their friends and family tht this is the best hot chocolate made in the world.  If I were to trade my time to do that, I'd get paid for that.  I'd also get paid for anyone else I've gotten to do that with me.  \\n\\nSo, it makes sense.  It works, if you work it.  What are the drawbacks?  I've looked into a few, and found that I can't keep my dignity and do these things.  I am a thinking person, and thinking is not allowed with these groups.  They want you to follow the formula, kind of like a drone in a bee hive. \\n\\nAlso, a lot of these groups don't have a lot of credibility.  Face it, you hang out with a lot of people that are kind of like you.  In an MLM, a lot of people aren't like you.  When you bring people like you to meet with people not like you, they wonder if you're like them.  In a typical business arrangement, Nordstrom shoppers don't mix with thrift store shoppers, and so nobody questions whether the store can meet their needs.  MLMs mix up the people in a way that favors people who believe in the lottery, but don't invest in their own education.  \\n\\nLast thought: I know a lot of dignified and successful people who have worked in MLMs.  Some of these have incredible wealth, and they did it on the merits of their labor, not on anything else.  It's a way to level the playing field.  \\n\\nWhatever you decide, good luck

No, it does not always justify a mother/child relationship. If there is some other lady, unfortunately they have a very hard time, if not impossible, being "mom" because they are not the genetic mother who is there all the time. Unfortunately there are people out there like you describe, but we really can't do anything about it. Now if murder was legal,,,,,,
Instead of trying to get a job working for someone else, try putting an add in your local paper, spreading the word, that you are willing to come to a person's home, or business, and setting up the security needs, that they might have..There are all kinds of possibilities that you could do..You will be surprised how many people need a service like that..Good Luck
Oooo, that's a good one, and thanks, because I was going to ask a similar question.\\nDid you ever look at a fan as you were walking towards it? If you take a heavy step, or stomp, the fan blades will appear to stutter, or freeze for just a second. Sort of a strobe effect.\\nI think that this is related to the "bounce" in the computer monitor, which is also presenting moving images (at 60 or 120 cycles).\\nMy theory = which has not been confirmed - is that we are seeing a mental/psychological response to momentary interruption of the visual "signal" transmitted to the brain. The brain sort of smooths over the gap in signal, which results in a freeze-frame, in the case of the fan, or a bounce, in the case of the monitor.\\nI think the cause of this might be that vision is a chemical process in the rods and cones of the retina. A thump, produced by chewing or stepping, might cause a momentary change in the chemical reaction. \\nAnyway, I like your question ... it shows genuine curiousity about why things are the way they are ... which is the basis of good science.

If the screen was flashing you could possibly have migraines caused by the light.  I have a sensitivity to fluorescent lights and cannot stay under just that kind of light for more than an hour or so.  My neurologist said that the lights flash very quickly and it causes a reaction in the brain similar to epilepsy, but not on such a severe scale.  I would get terrible migraines and lose my short-term memory. Good luck!

NaCl solution... Salt in water.
Glycerol is used as a cryoprotectant at concentrations of between 5 and 20% for a number of reasons. Firstly, however, you need to know why a cryoprotectant is needed at all... Cells would otherwise be in some type of buffer and media, which if frozen, would cause ice formation inside and outside the cells, causing their death due to various reasnons including the freezing and non-freezing of solutes causing local increases in concentration, and ice crystals can cause rupture of membranes, as well as some other effects. Glycerol is therefore used as a cryoprotectant which allows for vitrification to occur, which is basically the lowering of the freezing temperature of the solutin as well as the increasing of its viscosity. This process prevents crystallization (ie. the ice crystals which are harmful to the cells). Obviously there are a number of cryoprotectants, but glycerol is cheap, fairly non-toxic to the cells, and since it is a polyol, provides some nutrient value to the cells.

As a paramedic, that looks good to me. You didn't mention your age or any health problems. If I were to see you in my ambulance, providing you didn't have any trauma, that is not a treatable blood pressure. Go to the American Heart Association web site. There is good info on blood pressure education. Also, don't hesitate to sit at one of those automated blood pressure machines at the pharmacy (Target, Walmart) and just get it checked. Most fire departmants welcome people to get their pressure checked for free. I took several people right to the hospital because I felt like they could stroke out any minute. Saved a life or two I'm sure.

No! It's against the LAW for a doctor to explore any PART of your body while you're under, that is not a required field for surgery.\\n\\nI'm an RN and can tell you, that a female nurse MUST be present at all times during a female patient's surgery or gynochological exam.  The same applies for dental.\\n\\nWhat will happen when you go to sleep is a mind blower.\\nYou never, ever feel yourself falling asleep because it happens so fast.\\nYou won't feel scared or have a clue as to when you fell asleep.  It happens quickly.\\n\\nYou'll be talking and in the middle of a sentence, you'll wake up and ask "What happened?  I thought you were going to perform surgery on me."\\n\\nThe reply you'll get is, "Sweetheart we already did it.\\nYour brain enterprates that only a split second has passed.\\n\\nThey are going to put you to sleep with an anesthesia, we call "twilight sleep."  It's mild but keeps you asleep so you don't feel any pain.  You wake up quickly from it and will be able to go home as soon as you can walk without falling down.\\n\\nIt has a tendancy to make you a little wobbly for about a half hour after you wake up.\\n\\nTrust me, you will probably get a kick out of this.  It's over before you know it and you won't have any scarey feelings.\\n\\nYou will however probably feel just a tiny bit of nausea(sick to your stomach) for about half an hour after waking up as well.\\nThis is normal and it goes away quickly.\\n\\nAny jittery or nervousness you will feel, is just the anesthesia wearing off and that too passes quickly.\\n\\nOnce you go through this experience, you will never be frighted again.\\n\\nI promise.  If ANYTHING, you'll probably get a kick out of it, like I mentioned earlier.\\n\\nThe only thing you'll remember is feeling REALLY GREAT before it's nighty night time, which takes only seconds.

Don't worry over it and buy hundreds of expensive creams. Spend time outdoors ( but protect yourself sensibly if its sunny) , drink lots of water, eat well- lots of fruit and veg and excercise and RELAX!

Every woman is different. This all depends on when you hit puperty. Some girls hit puperty early and their breast will develope and continue to grow until their late teens, Others hit puperty later and their breast will not stop growing until their early 20's. Also, when a woman becomes pregnant her breast will grow larger to produce the milk needed for when the baby is born. Once she stops breast feeding and the milk dries up her breast should go back to the same size they were before she was pregnant or slightly larger.

You are a wise, caring sister.  YES, he WILL do it again!  Here in my state, you can still press charges.  There is no time limit.  Go to the Department of Social Services and tell them you want to report sexual abuse (it would be better if your sister did this).  Don't be afraid to go, and STOP taking Mom's advice (shame on her for making you girls keep quiet about it).  They may not be able to convict him now, but at least people will know what he did, and others will beware of him.  Now, don't be afraid.  I will be praying for you and your sister to stand strong.

A player is in an offside position if, when the ball is played by a team-mate, they are nearer to the opposition's goal line than both the ball and the second last opponent. \\n\\nYou can't be offside if: \\n\\n\\nYou receive the ball directly from a goal kick, a throw-in or a corner \\nyou are in your own half of the pitch \\nyou are level with the second last or last two opponents \\nyou are level with or behind the team-mate who plays you the ball\\nyou are not actively involved in play\\n\\nFor any offside offence, the referee awards an indirect free-kick to the opposing team, to be taken from the place where the infringement occurred.

<Gas solubility> : Henry' s law\\n  At higher pressures, gases tend to go into solution.\\n(e.g. soda pop)\\n  The solubility of gas is directly proportional to the\\npressure.\\n\\n  Henry' s law: Cg = kPg \\n(The gas solubility equation )\\n\\n Cg = solubility of gas (M), k = Henry s law const.\\n Pg = partial pressure of the gas\\n\\nWhere Cg is the molar concentration of the gas in the solution, Pg is the partial pressure of the gas, and k is a solubility constant that is dependent upon the gas and the solvent. As we might predict, k is going to be dependent upon the intermolecular forces between the solvent and the gas.\\nThe solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas on the surface of the liquid according to __Henry' s law.__\\n\\n\\n<Solubility of gases in water>\\nIt is quite well known that gases are soluble in liquids such as water. The ability of fish to breathe is dependent upon this fact. We bubble air into a fish tank and have water fountains in water purification tanks for the express purpose of improving the effieiency of the solution process. All of our carbonated beverages have their characteristic properties because of the solubility of carbon dioxide in water. We know that a soda left open in a warm room will get flat quickly. All of these observations are dependent upon the solubility of gases in water.

Because the Jewish have become a force in the world. The American natives prefer to live their lives as they are, quite aware that the material world isn't as important as people seem to believe. \\n\\nThe Jews used their influence and remorse over the Holocaust to cover their genocide of the Palestinians and to acquire the land that's now called Israel.\\n\\nAnd one of the previous answers here needs a factual correction. Saddam ordered the killing in cold blod of about 10 thousand Iraqi's in three rows. The Bush family (the Sr and the Jr) managed to kill more than 1.5 million and the count still goes on, where near 1 million were killed due to the embargo that preceeded the oil-for-food programme, embargo which they thought would help to ignire a revolution in Iraq to topple Saddam. Instead it lead to a humanitarian disaster, where a million people died due to the lack of food and medical supplies. UN reports counted about 500 thousand children that died due to direct effects of the embargo, reports which in turn led to the resignation of the chief of the UN aid envoy to Iraq.\\nConsidering the counting still goes on, I believe the numbers speak for themselves. You can't say that 10 thousand bodies are genocide ... but the 1.5 million are indeed.
they believed they would need thier bodies in the afterlife

Well, reading over your question (and unable to read a line of it due to it having been censored out with stars), it seems to me that you are mixing up sexual feelings with outside life.\\n\\nYou say 'what causes one to have these feelings of hatred towards a certain gender?'.  You know better than me of how you feel, but is it really a hatred of men that you have?  Wanting to sexually torture or humiliate another person doesn't mean anything outside the bedroom!  Now, there are people who are sadists throughout their entire lives, and there are those who keep it only sexual.  Moreover, even those who are sadists in all aspects of their lives may absolutely respect and love those who are the recipients of their sadism.  The point I'm trying to make, I guess, is that it's doubtful you actually hate men- you say you love your boyfriend- it's something else going on with your sadism.\\n\\nThere's a lot that makes control enjoyable and sexual.  Torturing (and I use that as a relative term- a little whipping, etc.) is a demonstration of your ability to have control, to roleplay in that way, possibly to have some control if you feel you don't have any in the other parts of your life.  Or it can just get you hot.  There are a lot of connections between sex and pain- both are intense physical and emotional sensations.  Both show how much the body can take and how it reacts.  A lot of people dabble in it- from a sexy little pinch, to a slap on the tush during lovemaking.\\n\\nI'd also remind you that sadism doesn't equal inhumanity.  There are also masochists- people who love to get what sadists dish out.  And you might want to check out some BDSM literature to see if how you feel checks out with traditional definitions- a lot of being a sadist, at least the way it is defined today, is loving and taking wonderful care of your 'slave'- pain is a good part of an overall relationship.\\n\\nOf course, whether you want to let your boyfriend in on this or keep it as a fantasy is up to you, although a lot of men get turned on by a woman who takes control in the bedroom or even of being submissive.  But maybe tone it down a bit the first time.\\n\\nGood luck, and don't worry, you aren't alone!  This is very normal!
i dont now so how are you
The umbra (Latin: "shadow") is the darkest part of a shadow. From within the umbra, the source of light is completely blocked by the object causing the shadow. This contrasts with the penumbra, where the light source is only partially blocked and there is only a partial shadow.
Dear Bobo:\\n\\nI think it is very natural to feel worried about a heart attack if one's father has just died of one a couple of months ago. \\n\\nHere is my answer:\\n\\nFIRST: You ARE worried; the question is, SHOULD you be worried? \\n\\nThe answer is more difficult than just statistics. If you want statistics, cardiac risk, i.e. the risk of a heart attack can be easily calculated:\\n\\nhttp://hp2010.nhlbihin.net/atpiii/calculator.asp\\n\\nBut as it states, this calculator, which is used nearly universally by physicians, applies only for those age 20 or greater. Why is that? Because the heart is like pump -- like any mechanical thing, be it one's car or one's sneakers, it wears out over time, and the older one is, the more likely one is have one's heart give out. Since 20 year olds rarely die of heart attacks (i.e. unless you do crack, etc), its not possible to calculate the odds for the "average" 16 year old.\\n\\nSECOND: What IS a heart attack? Generally, it implies a blockage of one of the arteries supplying blood to the heart. The heart, like any muscle, or any machine, requires fuel -- in this case, oxygen, which is supplied to it by the piping called coronary arteries. When these get plugged up, like any pipe, what is needed can't get through. When this happens to living tissue, the tissue dies. In the case of the heart, as it is the main (and only) pump supplying blood to the rest of the body, if the damage is servere enough, then the pump (i.e. heart) completely fails, the entire body is starved of oxygen, and one passes away.\\n\\nWhat, then, makes one more likely to have a heart attack? Many things, such as genetics, i.e. a family history of heart disease. But, from this discription, anything that stresses or clogs the piping (arteries) to the heart -- i.e. causes heart disease, also known as atherosclerosis. Stuff like high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes (sugar in the piping, like sugar-water on the table, is sticky and gums up the works), high cholesterol, obesity (which is often a cause of SLEEP APNEA), all increase one's risk.\\n\\nGenerally, when a healthy 16 year old walks into a doctor's office asking, am i at risk for a heart attack, the physician will likely wonder why the patient is asking, rather than being worried about the patient actually being at risk.\\n\\nWhich brings me to YOUR question: "could somebody help me?" \\n\\n-- the answer I think is: please, please consider talking to a counselor at your school; friends, siblings, a hotline, a doctor. You are worried about your mortality; And right after a family member has died, more so. It's natural, but often, it helps to talk about it. \\n\\nGo ask your doctor this question, and see what she or he has to say. It'll be worth it. As for heart disease, see your doctor regularly over the years, listen to their advice, and . . .\\n\\nKeep well, keep healthy.\\n\\n-------\\n\\nDisclaimers: \\n\\nIn addition to the disclaimers already stated by Yahoo.com: \\n\\nNOTE: The information communicated here does not constitute or imply a patient-doctor interaction or relationship; the reader and/or recipient of any "answer" agrees to hold the writer harmless from any loss, harm, injury or damage resulting from or arising out of your submission of the question or your use of or reliance on any response thereto.\\n\\nAs Stated: Yahoo!

I'm not sure what state you live in but you might want to contact your labor board to find out what the employer laws are.  In California, these have to be posted in a general employee space where every employee is likely to see it to refer to if need be.  Ours is in our convenience center and actually becomes good reading material while copying.  \\n\\nYou might also contact McDonald's corporate office.  If this is an independent franchise, city/state laws may  be in effect.  If anything, the manager will be cited (and perhaps fired) for not conforming to legal employment practices.  The second link is where to contact McDonald's - you could send an anonymous e-mail to ask about their employment practices.  Trust me, someone from their corporate office will investigate this.  But also try your city/state employment office to see what the law states about smoking in a food service establishment.  There may be a law that there should be a designated area for employees and if these people are disobeying this regulation, they could be fined or dismissed, as well as the manager.\\n\\nYou deserve a right to breathe clean air!

It really depends on the slave owner during that era. Some slaves were treated badly there is no doubt about that but you must also remember that there is always two sides to a coin.  Not all slave owners were horrible to the slaves. In fact at one point when the slaves were freed some actually stayed with there owners and became crop sharers. Continuing to do what they were doing prior to being freed. \\n\\nI live in the south and am very proud to be southern. I never owned a slave nor did any member of my ancestors in fact my grandmother worked along side the coloreds in the cotton fields less than 50 years ago.

I'm POSITIVE that Gotlurk.net/#lurk has Fruits Basket.  If you wish to choose this direction, you'll need the IRC client, MIRC.  You can find it at MIRC.com.

There is no "sin."  There is good and evil, right and wrong, and morality and immorality.

tough conversion. do-able, but will require custom headers, motor mounts, firewall mods, mods to the trans tunnel, custom driveshaft and of course, a new rear.  Probably the easiest way to physically get the engine into the car would be to use engine plates.  They will give you the most room to work with when it comes to putting an exhaust on the thing. oil pan issues may arise as a result of the stock crossmember, just be aware of it.  One or the other (crossmember or pan) may require surgery.  Working your way back, the struts up front need attention--the added weight of the small block may cause front tire clearance issues.  \\n\\nhammers, mallets, torches--they can be used to "modify" your firewall and trans tunnel as necessary.  Your trans crossmember will require attention to adapt the new trans.\\n\\nif you do the measurements correctly, just about any driveshaft shop can handle that part of the project.  The could probably help you with getting that rear narrowed.  I reccomend a ford 8.8 (readily available) + you can get decent axles, brakes, and wheels to go with it at a reasonable price.

you need to completely wipe the hard drive and reinstall Microsoft (i'm assuming thats what you have) after installing windows. install McAfee or Norton (although I found McAfee to be a lot better protection) I would also install a pop up blocker (I use Ad ware and Spybot, they work really well) then continue installing windows updates then everything else onto your computer.\\ndon't plug into the net unless you have to, until after you've installed McAfee.

In physics and chemistry, a plasma is typically an ionized gas, and is usually considered to be a distinct phase of matter in contrast to solids, liquids, and gases because of its unique properties. "Ionized" means that at least one electron has been dissociated from a proportion of the atoms or molecules. The free electric charges make the plasma electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields.\\n\\nThis fourth state of matter was first identified in a discharge tube (or Crookes tube), and so described by Sir William Crookes in 1879 (he called it "radiant matter")]. The nature of the Crookes tube "cathode ray" matter was subsequently identified by British physicist Sir J.J. Thomson in 1897], and dubbed "plasma" by Irving Langmuir in 1928 ], perhaps because it reminded him of a blood plasma]. Langmuir wrote:\\n\\n"Except near the electrodes, where there are sheaths containing very few electrons, the ionized gas contains ions and electrons in about equal numbers so that the resultant space charge is very small. We shall use the name plasma to describe this region containing balanced charges of ions and electrons."\\nPlasma typically takes the form of neutral gas-like clouds or charged ion beams, but may also include dust and grains (called dusty plasmas). [5] They are typically formed by heating and ionizing a gas, stripping electrons away from atoms, thereby enabling the positive and negative charges to move freely.

Yes, you do feel guilty when you've sinned or hurt others who don't deserve such injustice.\\nOr when you've caused trouble for others because of something you did. \\n\\nThe best way is to ask God for forgiveness because sometimes it is better we don't approach the person we've hurt. Further communication no matter the good intent may ignite the situation more.\\n\\nAnother way, is to avoid thinking too much about it by focussing on other things after you've asked God for forgiveness. Sports has always been a good outlet to distract oneself from the difficult things we have to face.
I would choose Pujols due to his all around great playing and his history of being injury free. You can count on him pretty much every day. A-rod is an all around type of player as well but he does not get as much rbi's due to the star line up they have and you can never tell when he may go down again. He has been injury free for a while but you never know. And right now Pujols has been really injury free.
I don't know where the 0.07 Amps came from.  You can be killed by a whole lot less!  0.07A is 70 mA.  For perspective, the GFCI trip level is 4 to 6 mA, because more than that can kill you.  The exact amount can vary by person, and some people can be killed even with a GFCI tripping.\\n\\nThe voltage is important only from ohms law, the higher the voltage the higher the current.  The biggest resistance is the skin, and that is lower when the skin is wet.

detroit pistons remind me of the detroit red wings (hockey).  they are the best team in the regular season, but can't get it done during the playoffs.  pistons aren't as "bad" as everybody thinks.  they play good defense, but their offense is (although improved) still pretty bad.  \\n\\nthe heat remind me of the lakers a few years ago...except now kobe is replaced by wade.  they got the 1-2 punch...and shaq can handle wallace or anybody they put on him.  they rested him for the playoffs and if shaq stays out of foul trouble, pistons are in trouble.
Exercise is a great way to get energy, especially cardio exercise.  I bought some dance tapes, I especially love DANCE Fat Burning Party by Crunch Videos.  Another thing that will help is MAKING yourself get up for a week, maybe two when the alarm does go off.  I used to be a snooze button hitter myself, and that much disturbed sleep is not sleep at all.  Also find a time to go to bed and stick to it, most people need between 6-9 hours of sleep a night, I have found the best to be 7-8, going towards 9 hours and people start to get too much sleep, which can make you just as tired as not enough sleep.  When you wake up in the morning especially when you start getting used to your schedule, splash your face a couple of times with cold water, and so come stretches over all your body.  Good luck! :)  And don't hit the snooze button any more.  :)  TRUST ME.
In reality, it's not the hot water that actually KILLS the germs; it's the friction.  When you wash, using mild soap all you really need is WARM water and lots of hand rubbing, or friction.  This is what kills the bacteria.  Hot, or warm water just feels better on the skin than COLD water...

It sounds like a bad idea if you couldn't even make it four months.  Love and relationships are a combination of things and sometimes little things like being near family or living in a certain place are part of that combination.  In your case it sounds like it is important that your close to your family and friends.  Maybe he should move to where you are instead of you doing the moving.
I think it's safe to say that PPh2 is soft, considering it has a phosphorus central atom with 2 benzene rings. The defining characteristic is that the molecule has a diffuse electron cloud, caused by the delocalized pi system in the benzene rings as well as the size of the phosphorus electron cloud.\\n\\nAs to your reaction, I'm not sure. Is this a ligand substitution?

I believe you should ask the doctors doing the physicals for your company. I don't see what kind of help you can get from making your test results public like this.

The expression has in origins in the medical profession. Doctors in Britain were not permitted to work on dead bodies until an Act of Parliament permitting them to do so was passed in 1832. Prior to this date the only bodies they could dissect for medical purposes were those of executed criminals. Although the execution of criminals was far from rare in 18th century Britain, it was very unlikely that a doctor would come across many corpses during his working life. It was therefore common practice for a doctor who had the good fortune to dissect the corpse of an executed criminal to keep the skeleton for research purposes. Public opinion would not permit doctors to keep skeletons on open view in their surgeries so they had to hide them. Even if they couldn’t actually see them, most people suspected that doctors kept skeletons somewhere and the most logical place was the cupboard. The expression has now moved on from its literal sense!
actually it depends on your feelings for each other,if you were truly in love then you shouldnt have many problems if you get back together.

Primarily, #3 epitomizes the doctrine.\\n\\nThe Monroe Doctrine states three major ideas, with one more added by President Theodore Roosevelt. First, it conveys that European countries cannot colonize in any of the Americas: North, Central, or South. Second, it enforces Washington's rule of foreign policy, in which the U.S. will only be involved in European affairs if America's rights are disturbed. Third, the U.S. will consider any attempt at colonization a threat to its national security. Roosevelt added to the doctrine, and summed up his additions with the statement, "Speak softly and carry a big stick."\\n\\nThe border dispute with Venezuela would have essentially grown British holdings in South America, thus breaking the primary tenant of the doctrine >> European countries cannot colonize in any of the Americas: North, Central, or South.\\n\\nBut more deeply seeded and self-serving plans were behind the creation of the Monroe Doctrine...\\n\\nThe end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 marked the breakup of the Spanish empire in the New World. Between 1815 and 1822 Jose de San Martin led Argentina to independence, while Bernardo O'Higgins in Chile and Simon Bolivar in Venezuela guided their countries out of colonialism. The new republics sought -- and expected -- recognition by the United States, and many Americans endorsed that idea.\\n\\nBut President James Monroe and his secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, were not willing to risk war for nations they did not know would survive. From their point of view, as long as the other European powers did not intervene, the government of the United States could just let Spain and her rebellious colonies fight it out.\\n\\nGreat Britain was torn between monarchical principle and a desire for new markets; South America as a whole constituted, at the time, a much larger market for English goods than the United States. When Russia and France proposed that England join in helping Spain regain her New World colonies, Great Britain vetoed the idea.\\n\\nThe United States was also negotiating with Spain to purchase the Floridas, and once that treaty was ratified, the Monroe administration began to extend recognition to the new Latin American republics -- Argentina, Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico were all recognized in 1822.\\n\\nSo the dispute over the Venezuelan border was truthfully the best example of enforcement, as we (and the British) tacitly supported the Bolivarian movement in Venezuela. So we publicly chastised Britain t give them an image of compliance while, gaining their support of the doctrine against France, Russia and Spain... giving us and the British free reign over the commercial markets.

No, it's not compulsory for British princes to get military training. At one point it was traditional for the second son to join the services and doing so was seen as a suitable 'occupation' for them and some have made a career of it. Prince Harry has wanted to be a soldier since he was a child so his joining the services right out of school is not surprising. \\n\\nPrince William went to University before deciding on military training. It's unlikely that he will see combat but the training that he receives will serve him well when he becomes King. As Sovereign, he will automatically become head of the armed services.

I once had to sit with an elderly lady who was really mean.\\nIt was the weekend shift- two 14 hour days.\\n\\nAll she did was nap and eat. When she was awake she would complain. Anything nice or any attempts to connect with her were shot down with insults. She'd spill her food on purpose and spit at me sometimes.\\n\\nI could read while she slept, but after a while that gets boring also and your eyes start to get sore. \\n\\nShe was really wealthy and lived in a nursing home, so I didn't have to change her diapers- but I was so bored that I would offer to take out the trash and do little things- just for something to do!\\n\\nFor $6.50 an hour, it was hell. I know some jobs are more physically demanding, but atleast the days go by quicker. 14 hours of sitting on my butt or getting crabbed at was no fun!

Society is more open towards men being overtly sexual. I think most women on the whole are less sexual then men....and are encouraged to be less then they otherwise would be even further by cultural moores.  It's the same reason almost no women admit to touching themselves.  Most men have no problem admitting it.....even comparing techniques.  Personally I find honest women who are open about their sexuality a huge turn on....and women who like porn?  Hell yes!!!  I won't have to hide it when she comes over.  I don't think it's even that unusual for women to watch (although clearly less common then in men).

The basic rule is : design a site for the user, not for the search engines. Create great original content that users would love and other sites would want to link to -- and top rankings in the search engine will follow. \\n\\nContent must be compelling, accessible and unique - this is a key ingredient in getting links. Make sure people can link to specific content.\\n\\nHere are tips by Adam Lasnik, Google's search evangelist (yes, that's his actual title)\\n\\nMake your pages easy to index. Think about the terms that visitors will use to search for your information and make sure your pages include those words. Provide a unique title tag and meta description tag for each page. Use descriptive anchor text when linking to other pages of your site (e.g., "Obtain the latest federal tax forms for 2006" instead of "Click here for 2006 federal tax forms") \\n\\nMake your pages easy to find.  Provide an HTML sitemap that contains links to pages deeper in the site. On your home page, include links to the major sections inside the site. If your site includes many pages, consider creating a browsable set of links that enables the visitor to choose a category, then see links within that category. \\n\\nMake sure search engines can access the content.  Ensure pages of your site can be reached without cookies, registration, session IDs, or forms. Verify that your site isn't blocked with a robots.txt file and that search engines don't receive errors when trying to access your pages. (You can check both of these things using Google's webmaster tools.) \\n\\nDon't be an island.  Responsibly interact with realted sites to garner natural links, and -- more importantly -- mindshare.  Search engine conferences are a great opportunity to learn and network, but participation on forums and blogs can also be very productive. \\n\\nStudy the source.  Regularly review search engines' often-updated official written advice (e.g., Webmaster Guidelines, blogs, etc.).\\n\\nYou can read more of Adam's tips at http://docs.google.com/Doc.aspx?id=a4bb8f9kppt_0drmp5z&access=firstgov\\n\\nIf you are going to read only one piece on search engine optimization, I suggest you read Brett Tabke of WebmasterWorld.com's "Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone: 26 steps to 15k a day." http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm \\n\\nWebmasterWorld.com http://www.webmasterworld.com has different sections that cover various aspects of search engine optimization, and each section is participated in by respected webmasters and even search engine employees (e.g. there's a GoogleGuy that responds to Google topics)\\n\\nOther resources that can help you get top ranking in the search engines are:\\n\\nGoogle Press Releases http://googlepress.blogspot.com/ \\nMatt Cutts Blog (Adam's boss) http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/  (Matt is a Google software engineer)\\nDigitalpoint Yahoo Forums http://forums.digitalpoint.com/forumdisplay.php?f=6\\nSearchEngineWatch's MSN Forums http://forums.searchenginewatch.com/forumdisplay.php?f=8\\n\\nAs for tools to help you get top rankings in the search engine, here are some of the best in the field today\\n\\nTotal Optimizer Pro http://www.totaloptimizer.com/\\nKeyword density tool http://googlerankings.com/ultimate_seo_tool.php\\nGoogle Sitemaps (to help Google index your pages faster) https://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/siteoverview?hl=en\\nSEO Book - lots of free great SEO tools http://tools.seobook.com/
I believe "When in Rome...".  Most Americans practice some version of Christianity.  Of course there are large Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist and other religious groups that make-up the true fabric and character of this place.  Many friends of mine are Muslim.

What bothers me about this political correctness we seem to be stuck on is that it does not take into account how intelligent the average person is.  The only people I know of that are offended by Merry Christmas are big idiots.  If someone said Happy Hanukkah or Happy Ramadan or any other seasonal greeting I wouldn't take offense.  Heck, I would be happy that people of whatever faith or culture thought enough of me to grace me with a sweet greeting! In America December 25th is a major holiday called Christmas!  Other holidays overlap this time of year but people are smart enough to know what's going on. We need to lighten up and just enjoy the 'Holidays' by any name.  Thanks for the question.
Well first of all you have to be an officer in the branch of the armed forces that you choose.  So you have to be an air force officer and get through flight school.  Well you have to be accepted into that school first.. pretty competitive.  You need to have great vision, be pretty intelligent, and disiplined.
It was their father. Actually, I think it was technically Chad's father, since Chad and Mike Kroeger are half-brothers.
THAT my friend is a morbid thought.
well you could talk to him and see what the real problem is. if it has anything to do with their relationship then you could try to work it out between them and if not then just tell them they weren't meant to be together. when my best friend and cousin were dating i was ok with it. we went to a camp-out with a bunch of different churches and they argued the whole time. an old friend of my friend was there and she spent a lot of time with him. my cousin got mad and said that she was cheating on him when she wasn't. i talked about it to both of them and found out that they weren't really happy with each other and they eventually broke-up.

I like the idea about how someone name affects his fate.\\nI would name myself Yousef, Having a jewish name is cool (I was thinking this is an arabic name but I have a jew friend with that name so its common between Arabs and Jews and it has the benefits of both :D)\\nHis story as a prophet is also cool. \\nMost handsome guy of the world, sold as a slave by his brothers, bought by a king, accused by a nympho, spent many years in jail, became king and returned to his family.

Forensic Scientist ($22,000-35,000)\\n\\nJob Description\\nForensic scientists collect and analyze evidence found at crime scenes. Specifically, they analyze blood, saliva, semen, drugs, fingerprints, and firearms and perform reconstructions on skeletal bones. Forensic scientists also confer with law enforcement personnel and attorneys on evidence collection, preserve evidence, write reports, and testify in court. The scientific analysis of evidence often proves critical in determining the innocence or guilt of a person accused of a crime. Thus, forensic scientists play a vital role in the criminal justice process.\\n\\nEducation\\nEntry-level jobs in forensic science require a four-year degree in one of the following: biology, chemistry, physics, microbiology, genetics, or medical technology. Communication arts and law classes are considered helpful. Some crime labs also require laboratory experience.\\n\\nSpecial Skills\\nA forensic scientist works with many different kinds of people, often under stressful circumstances. Thus, it is essential for a person in this field to have good "people" skills. Because forensic scientists must complete many reports and make court appearances, they must be capable writers and good speakers. Finally, forensic scientists must be able to manipulate tiny bits of evidence under a microscope that requires excellent hand-eye coordination.\\n\\nSalary and Benefits\\nForensic scientists generally work for state or federal crime laboratories. Because these positions are found primarily in government, some medical and retirement benefits are paid.\\nAt the state level, beginning forensic scientists are paid about $1,900 per month. Those who start with laboratory experience may receive as much as $3,000 per month. Depending on the state, experienced workers may eventually earn between $35,000 and $50,000 per year. Federal salaries are usually higher.\\n\\nWorking Conditions\\nAs employees of the government, forensic scientists generally work 40-hour weeks. However, because of increasing caseloads and the need to meet deadlines, they may work extra hours.\\nForensic scientists work primarily in the crime lab. However, they also go to the scene of the crime to examine and secure evidence, and they testify in court.\\n\\nOutlook\\nGood forensic scientists are always in demand. However, because of pressures to reduce government funding, beginning positions are usually limited, and competition for them is keen. The job outlook in this area is, at best, fair.\\n\\nFor More Information\\nAmerican Academy of Forensic Sciences\\nP.O. Box 669\\n410 North 21st St., Suite 203\\nColorado Springs, CO 80901

There is a book called "Overthrow : America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq".  It talks about 14 cases when the US became involved in another country. ie) panama, nicaragua, hawaii, iraq, iran, cuba, and more. The author was a foreign correspondent for the New York Times and says how the countries where the US became involved in, were worse off than before the Us became involved.  He also says that the US becomes involved in other countries basically to protect US international business.  ITs a great read.

Actually, Japanese citizens and citizens of Brunei and Singapore do not need visas to go to many countries in Europe and North America.\\n\\nThe reason is simple.  Due to disparate standards of living, without immigration controls, such as visas, large numbers of the population of developing countries would crowd into the countries requiring visas, resulting in high unemployment and an upswing in social problems.  this has been demonstrated in very many cases over the last 100 years.  There was even a time when immigrants from Europe to the US returned to Europe because there were too many of them and they couldn't make a living (Italian to US immigration backflow of the early 20th century).\\n\\nBy imposing a visa regime, the country requiring the visa gets to look at applicants for a visa to determine if they intend to try to become economic refugees (so to speak).  Yes, it is true that many people aren't interested in illegally immigrating, but many are.  When you have almost 10,000,000 people in the country illegally already, it is a strain on the infrastructure in some places.\\n\\nThe countries with visa regimes generally have ways to obtain an immigrant visa to go into their country legally.  this is to limit the number of people to a manageable group.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there aren't a lot of people who are looking to immigrate from the United States or Britain to the Philippines to improve their lives and economic condition.  It is as simple as that.  Once you can demonstrate good ties to your home country (better than average job, property; in other words, the things that make you a credible tourist) you will find it easy to get a visa.  \\n\\nIf you are upset because it is hard to get a visa to go and stay with your cousin in LA fora month and the air ticket price represents two months wages, it is hard to justify yourself as a bonifide tourist (just an example, I don't know your details).
Schools are rethinking meritocracy, but maybe not in ways you think. This is an interesting time to be an educator in the US because there are at least two different paradigm shifts happening in education right now. Those two changes are happening in opposite directions, which leave teachers twisted into impossible contortions.\\n\\nIn the universities, teachers are being trained to understand that each student is an individual with different strengths and weaknesses. They are being taught to recognize the different multiple intelligences (interpersonal, intrapersonal, bodily/kinesthetic, musical/rhythmic, naturalistic, visual/spatial, verbal, mathematical/logical) and learning styles of children. Teachers are learning to honor and make use of cultural differences as well in the learning experiences and opportunities to demonstrate knowledge they create in their classroom. \\n\\nNew educators are learning how important hands-on experiences are for young learners preparing to make the jump from concrete to abstract thinking. They are encouraged to let students run parent-teacher conferences by choosing samples of work to go in a portfolio and explaining to the parent exactly what each piece of the portfolio shows that they have learned. This will help students take ownership of the processes of learning and demonstrating their knowledge, and they will become self-directed learners. \\n\\nTeacher are working to create a learning community where students feel free to be take risks, be wrong, and tell each other what can make their projects better. Students are learning critical thinking skills by evaluating their own and each others' work. \\n\\nAll of this is happening along with a growing recognition that students have to build their own knowledge by connecting new facts and ideas to what they already know and what they are interested in. More and more teachers are seeing the value of individual projects that let a student make some creative decisions on their own and lead to a finished product that they themselves judge to be of good quality. \\n\\nAt the same time, politicians have gotten involved in education. There is a growing movement some call the Cult of Accountabilism. This means that politicians want to hold schools accountable for what they are teaching. The methods of accountability states have devised are not very creative--chiefly fill-in-the-bubble tests of verbal and mathematical skills. \\n\\nThere are severe punishments for schools that fail to raise test scores under the federal No Child Left Behind law. I've seen reductions in funding and many extra meetings with consultants who are hired to raise test scores. I've also seen a district gradually choke off funding and then fire the principal and all the teachers at schools that fail to perform. The district leadership hires a new staff and pumps extra money into the school, taking credit when test scores go up. \\n\\nThose pressures mean grades will be around at most schools for a long time to come. At the same time, many states in the US are changing report cards to something that parents will need to learn to understand. It's called a standards-based report card.\\n\\nUsed to be, you got grades that reflected some kind of weighted percentage of the assignments, questions, problems you successfully completed. Those that were given to you reflected a teacher's idea of what students in that grade and that subject should be able to do. There might be a very complicated letter sent home with the formula that showed how the grades for homework, tests, and other assignments were combined. \\n\\nNow states have lists of content standards and benchmarks that represent what students in different grades and different subjects should be able to do. \\n\\n"Students will be able to correctly add numbers of three digits, with regrouping." \\n"Students will be able to write a persuasive essay with three supporting arguments." \\n"Students will demons

FIRST OF ALL, LET ME SAY THAT I LOVE YOU FOR ASKING THAT QUESTION!!!!!!!! I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED THE SAME THING!!! JESUS BE WITH YOU!
Blood Cholesterol is produced by our body for several purposes. In some people it is produced more than is required by our body, especially when the diet contains saturated fats. Saturated fats in the diet force the body to make too much cholesterol. The cholesterol may become high when our diet is rich in saturated fats that are found only in animal products. Plant foods do not contain any cholesterol, but the animal foods are loaded with cholesterol and fats. Most of the fast foods are very rich in fats, monounsaturated fats. If you eat lot of meats and fast foods, then the chances are that you have high cholesterol. You should get your blood cholesterol checked. Remember that without your blood cholesterol report, you can not know if you have high cholesterol.\\n\\nNote that you do not always need to take medication for controlling your cholesterol. There are several natural heart friendly foods that are good for controlling cholesterol without any medication. Good eating habits and some exercise can control your cholesterol and triglycerides naturally.\\n\\nFoods you must avoid!\\n\\ni. Salt\\n\\nSalt is the greatest culprit for diabetics. You get enough salt from vegetables in inorganic form, so reduce the intake of inorganic salt.\\n\\nii. Sugar\\n\\nSucrose, a table sugar, provides nothing but calories and carbohydrates. \\n\\nAlso, you need calcium to digest sucrose. Insufficient sucrose intake might lead to calcium being leached off the bones. \\n\\nSubstitute sucrose with natural sugar, like honey, jaggery (gur), etc.\\n\\niii. Fat\\n\\nExcessive fat intake is definitely not a good habit.\\n\\nTry and exclude fried items from your diet totally. \\n\\nBut, remember, you must have a small quantity of oil to absorb fat-soluble vitamins, especially vitamin E.\\n\\niv. For non-vegetarians\\n\\nTry and stop the intake of red meat completely. \\n\\nTry to go in for a vegetarian diet. If you cannot, decrease the consumption of eggs and poultry. \\n\\nYou can, however, eat lean fish two to three times a week.\\n\\nv. Whole milk and products\\n\\nTry to switch to low fat milk and its products like yogurt (curd). \\n\\nReplace high fat cheese with low fat cottage cheese.\\n\\nvi. Tea and coffee\\n\\nDo not have than two cups of the conventional tea or decaffeinated coffee every day. \\n\\nTry to switch to herbal teas.\\n\\nvii. White flour and its products\\n\\nReplace these with whole grains, wholewheat or soya breads and unpolished rice.\\n\\nviii. Foods with a high glycemic index\\n\\nAvoid white rice, potatoes, carrots, breads and banana -- they increase the blood-sugar levels.  \\n\\nSpecial food for diabetics\\n\\ni. Bitter gourd (karela)\\n\\nThis vegetable contains a high dosage of 'plant insulin'. It lowers the blood-sugar levels effectively.\\n\\nHave the juice of three to four karelas early morning on an empty stomach. \\n\\nAs a vegetable, too, it can be taken on a regular basis. \\n\\nPowder the seeds of karela (measuring 1 teaspoon), mix with water and drink it.\\n\\nii. Fenugreek (methi)\\n\\nIt is the most common food used to control diabetes. \\n\\nGulp a teaspoonful of these seeds with a glass of water daily. \\n\\nSoak the seeds overnight. Have the water in which the seeds were soaked.\\n\\nYou can make a chutney with methi seeds. You can also eat them sprouted, dried and powdered, or mix them in wheat flour to make chapattis.\\n\\niii. Indian blackberry (jamun)\\n\\nThis fruit is very effective in preventing and controlling diabetes. \\n\\nPowder the stone of the fruit and eat it -- it contains glucoside, which prevents the conversion of starch into sugars.\\n\\niv. Garlic \\n\\nThis is used to lower blood-sugar levels. \\n\\nGarlic is rich in potassium and replaces the potassium which gets lost in urine. \\n\\nIt also contains zinc and sulphur, which are components of insulin. \\n\\nTake about three to four flakes of freshly crushed garlic daily.\\n\\nv. Onion \\n\\nBecause of its diuretic and digestive properties, onion works against diabetes. \\n\\nRaw onion is more useful.\\n\\nvi. Flaxseed\\n
Dude ... you have better things to do in 2nd year than worry about CAT. In a couple of years, when companies come calling for your batch guys, I am sure the packages they will offer will rival IIM packages. The top jobs at IIMs are I-Banks - which usually require you to have just the quantitative skills. These skills can be found in plenty among IITians and the companies are begining to realise this. So, forget about CAT. If you are interested in an MBA, do so after some years of experience. And join a finance/consults job right after IIT. Also, try to make full use of the Research Park coming up in collaboration with IITM in Tarams.

Take a look at this:\\n\\nTop 10 Democratic Sex Scandals in Congress\\n \\nFound this list at Human Events Online\\nWhat Rep. Foley did was evil immoral and reprehensible. I hope he is fully punished unlike the below listed Democrats.\\nhttp://www.humanevents.com/lists.php?id=17357\\n10. Sen. Daniel Inouye. The 82-year-old Hawaii Democrat was accused in the 1990s by numerous women of sexual harassment. Democrats cast doubt on the allegations and the Senate Ethics Committee dropped its investigation. \\n9. Former Rep. Gus Savage. The Illinois Democrat was accused of fondling a Peace Corps volunteer in 1989 while on a trip to Africa. The House Ethics Committee decided against disciplinary action in 1990.\\n8. Rep. Barney Frank. The outspoken Massachusetts Democrat hired a male prostitute who ran a prostitution service from Frank’s residence in the 1980s. Only two Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to censure him in 1990.\\n7. Former Sen. Brock Adams. The late Washington Democrat was forced to stop campaigning after numerous accusations of drugging, assault and rape, the first surfacing in 1988.\\n6. Former Rep. Fred Richmond. This New York Democrat was arrested in 1978 for soliciting sex from a 16-year-old. He remained in Congress and won re-election—before eventually resigning in 1982 after pleading guilty to tax evasion and drug possession.\\n5. Former Rep. John Young. The late Texas Democrat increased the salary of a staffer after she gave in to his sexual advances. The congressman won re-election in 1976 but lost two years later. \\n4. Former Rep. Wayne Hays. The late Ohio Democrat hired an unqualified secretary reportedly for sexual acts. Although he resigned from Congress, the Democratic House leadership stalled in removing him from the Administration Committee in 1976. \\n3. Former Rep. Gerry Studds. He was censured for sexual relationship with underage male page in 1983. Massachusetts voters returned him to office for six more terms.\\n2. Former Rep. Mel Reynolds. The Illinois Democrat was convicted of 12 counts of sexual assault with a 16-year-old. President Bill Clinton pardoned him before leaving office.\\n1. Sen. Teddy Kennedy. The liberal Massachusetts senator testified in defense of nephew accused of rape, invoking his family history to win over the jury in 1991.\\n\\nSee the difference between the Republican Foley and these Democrats is that Foley was ostracized and resigned. These Democrats, including the ones you mentioned, were re-elected countless times and rewarded by the Democrats. And then there is Nancy Pelosi's support of the Man Boy Love Association.

I would say the Jose Gonzalez version.

Fullmetal Alchemist for Drama, Inuyasha for suspense and bloodshed, and Beyblade for Saturday morning boredom. I haven't seen a new ep of Fullmetal or Inuyasha in the longest time. But I've read the episode summaries of Fullmetal and know how it ends. What about Inuyasha. The movies have been great!!!\\nYes, I deffinately like Fullmetal Alchemist the most. It's really a great plotline, but Yu Yu Hakusho and Rurouni Kenshin will take pride any day!!! ^_~V haha!
Cologne is a fine-smelling liquid that one applies to his body to make him smell better.  It is common in many European countries.  It originated during the black plague in Europe.  They would put cologne and perfume on a kerchief and when they passed a deceased person, they would smell the cologne to cover the other smells nearby.  Now, though, culture has transformed it into a symbol of status.  You smell like you are wearing expensive cologne and people treat you better.  It's all about status.

Sometimes that is just the way things are. You never know though. Some guys may really like you but be terrified of you at the same time. I never could understand why in high school boys were so mean to the girls they really liked. Hang in there. It gets better with time and you will meet someone you will be crazy about and they will feel just the same about you.

Far too many.  You have to be carefull.  My Dell came packed with a toolbar that made windows internet explorer fail to launch. I wish I could tell you what that was so you can avoid it.  I try to stay clear from toolbars.  I have a collection of search engines in my Mozilla Firefox browser, but they don't take much space. Plus I can pretty much build my own toolbar with Firefox with links to all my favorite spots, like e-mails, myspace, netflix, etc.  It's convenient and you don't need to install any extraneous software to add it to your browser.

Yes (short answer). Each state may impose a higher minimum wage than another but never lower than the federal government's mandate (currently: $5.15). You need to check with the local government. Most states do adhere strictly to the federal standard (neither raising or lowering their own standard). Vermont is, for example, one state which has a higher rate (though I don't recall their rate).\\n\\nSorry, I read the question wrong... thought you were asking about min. wage. Of course there's no other way to find the wage rate without the hours and total amount. Simple algebra:\\n\\nr * h = t  (r: rate per hour, h: hours worked, t: total amount earned)

According to Wikipedia;\\n\\nIceboxes date back to the days of ice harvesting which in a growing America had hit an industrial high that ran from the mid 19th century to the 1930's when the refrigerator was introduced into the home. Most municipally consumed ice was harvested and stored in ice plants which did not actually create artificial ice, but stored natural ice brought in from snow packed area or frozen lakes. Even Thoreau's Walden Pond was not spared from ice harvesting where some 1,000 tons of ice were harvested daily.\\n\\nI already knew they harvested the ice from frozen lakes. I didn't realize they stored it in "ice plants". So I learned something new!

excuse the other folks' rude answers.  it sounds like you are very worried about this.  do yourself a favor and relax.  do  you think maybe he's just telling you that to see if you'll tell him how much you care about him?  or do you  know for a fact his family may be planning to move there?  could be just a head game, i don't k now you guys' ages.  so many things we worry about never even happen, relax.  if in fact he does move, and  you find yourself with a broken heart, just try to keep really busy with your friends and family.  if you two are meant to be together it will happen t hat way.  and if not, you will fall in love with someone else and forget all about him if it'snot meant to be.  good luck

Well coming from a country that is nothing but muslims well my parents are anyways I was raised in spain but my parents and granparents and so on are from Iran. Here is the low down on those people who don't know let me educate you.\\n\\nThe only way a man can get a second or third wife *which by the way they can only hae 3* is if the first wife consents it because she can not provide him with a boy to carry the name. Sometimes they only have a marriage that last however long it takes to get a boy and then they divorce or whatever not usually though. ANyways the first wife is really incontrol if she wants to do it or not, the other way a man can go abouts doing that is if the wife leaves. FOr example my grandma was visiting my family in Spain and she stayed for like 4 years or something long time and my grandpa got this his secertary pregnant so he had to marry him by the muslim law. So he married her because  A. THe wife technically left him and B. she was pregnant.\\n\\nNot that he does not love you some females are okay with not having the man around and all they want out of life is children and a nice house and money right and some sex every now and then. But there is more to it than most westerns know anyways I dont know the rest of the details cause I am Christian and I know very limitted information about muslims *how ironic I know* BUt yeah there u go.

This is like asking, "What does blue smell like?" Blue is not in the category of things that have odor, so the question itself is flawed. In the same way, God is not in the category of things that are created, or come into existence, or are caused. God is uncaused and uncreated - He simply exists.  How do we know this? Well, we know that from nothing, nothing comes. So if there was ever a time when there was absolutely nothing in existence then nothing would have ever come to exist. But things do exist. Therefore, since there could never have been absolutely nothing, something had to have always been existing. That ever-existing thing is what we call God.

This is what normally happens.  First, the principal must be notified.  The principal is required to notify the district office and the department of education.  The principal will take statements from the student, the teacher and any witnesses.  Those findings are reported back to the district office and the department of ed.  Depending on those findings, the teacher can be placed on adminstrative leave while the department of ed investigates.  The deaprtment of ed can either let the teacher keep their job or can revoke the teacher's certificate.  Criminal charges may also be filed, but that's a whole different deal.  Once the department of ed makes a decision, that's the end.

Eubacteria, also known as the true bacteria, have a bad reputation. They are seen as disease causing agents. Every day new products come out adverstising their ability to destroy these microscopic but dangerous creatures. In reality, only a small percentage of these unicellular organisms cause disease. The rest fullfill many important roles in the natural world. Eubacteria can be photoautotrophs, saprophytes, or symbionts.

Research has proven that suppliments probably do little if any good. If you want instant weight gain, use Creatine...will add about 5 pounds of water to the average person, wets the muscles and helps them heal. Other than that, IF you get a good diet, suppliments are pretty much a waste of your money. Regardless of all the hype you see, old fashioned hard work and a good balanced diet is the only way it is going to happen. You do NOT want to put on fat, so stick with a good diet of meat, carbs, oils, in all, a balanced diet. There will be plenty who tell you >>>protein shakes, protein bars, etc...waste of money, period. But if it makes you feel like you are doing something, then do what ever you want. Good luck
because US thinks their the most powerful country in the whole wide world
Communism and socialism were the most imp. threat for US at that time. Soviet Union and China had emerged as powerful communist nations added with numerous other states. Peoples movement were going on and communists were strong in many coutries in Asia and Latin America. A large area of the world were under the ideological influence of communism and communism became popular among people from exploited and underdeveloped society. These were against the capitalistic and imperialist interest of many coutries. US was one of them.

It depends on your field and the caliber of school you're interested in. Medical school and law school are very intense from start to finish, whereas non-professional PhD or EdD programs are not as hard on your hair color (and/or hairline for males). But highly ranked programs will be very competitive and cut-throat in any field.\\n \\nI'm working towards my PhD in Economics in a second-tier program. I love graduate school for lots of reasons. For one, my classmates are amped up about learning and researching. As an undergrad, I was in a small minority because I liked school. Also, my graduate education will earn me a starting salary 100% higher than what I would have got straight out of undergrad. I get a full tuition waiver and a living stipend in exchange for some mild work, so I won't have to go into debt to get this degree.\\n\\nThe list of disadvantages could be pretty long, too. My friends that got jobs after undergrad are making grownup money, living in grownup houses, getting married, starting families, etc. I won't be able to do that for four years (although some grad students start families while they're still in school). Also, I hear that dissertation advisors can be real pains in the a**. \\n\\nAll in all, grad school is right for me. It's up to you to decide if it's right for you, and getting input from other veterans is a good start.

No.\\nThat school is a Diploma mill, and is an unaccredited institution of higher learning. You just wasted your money, no one will honor that degree. Sorry if this upsets you.\\n\\nHere is an article about that scam of a school.\\nhttp://www.wiu.edu/newsrelease.sphp?release_id=3683
taq polymerase originated in a thermophile, Thermus aquaticus.  At this point, the taq you actually use is probably the taq gene cloned into E. coli.\\n\\nAnyhow, as a thermophile, Thermus aquaticus lives in very high temperatures, and its enzymes can also function at the elevated temps.  This is important for PCR, where your extension is at 70C.  THe ability to withstand high temps is also important because of the denaturation step which separates your strands and allows for the continued amplification of PCR product.  \\n\\n"Back in the day" before thermostable polymerases, each round of amplificatin required the addition of new enzyme.  You can imagine how fun that must have been.\\n\\nNew thermostable enzymes are more thermostable, or faster, or have higher fidelity, etc.  Taq, however, for all of its short coming, is still mega cheap and used quite a bit.
Her's the LONG ANSWER. Don't read on if you have a limited attention span...\\n\\nMost Liberals don't hate America. Some do no doubt. What I think is that when some consevative talking head comes on the tube and says Liberals are baaaaad!!!!, many people swallow it. There are many impressionable people in this country who are DAMN mad and want to quench the bloodlust generated by the 9/11 attack. Capitalizing on this wave of patriotic zeal the hard core neo-cons (which are not the same as average Republicans) manipulated the entire post attack national conversation. They saw this national tragedy as a way to implement a broad and radical shift in U.S. foreign policy. The Neo-Cons were able to do this because nobody, Republican or Democrat had the balls to stand up to this radiacalism in the shadow of 9/11. The small govornment, fiscaly responsible Republicans have watched in disbelief as our budgetary spending has gone where no tax and spend Liberal ever dared take it. Inflating the budget wouldn't be so bad if it went to sensible programs for security and to update ifrastructure.But instead it is being used as thank you money in the form of "pork barrel " spending around the country, into the districts of those congressman and senators who vote in favor of the Neo-Con agenda.\\n The term Liberal is batted around so much it's funny. What the traditional notion is referring to is a tax and spend agenda. Giving poor and underprivelaged people breaks and assistance in a multitude of areas, thus taking money from the people who earn money. These Liberals are actually really angry with the current administration for the way it uses tax breaks for the wealthy. Then using the budgetary process gives more money to the wealthy via the industrial war production inflated by the war on terror. Then it gives  no-bid contracts to companies such as KBR (Haliburten) and others connected to the Neo-Con teat.\\nWhat you have is a giant spending machine where the profits keep returning to the same people. This notion has yet to sink in with most republicans. They are still too enraged by 9/11 to open their eyes to what is happening. They are being manipulated to cast out the Liberals with all of their uppity talk of Constitutional law and limited Executive power. Those aren't sexy ideas to think about and for this reason most of the ranting conservatives simply roll their eyes and shake their heads,and proclaim "We should pitty those poor deluded Liberals".\\nWell one day (or not) the rest of the country will wake up and join the Liberals. The old fasion Reagan Conservatives will wake up the quickest. They'll wonder why G.W. hasn't seen fit to put an end to the orgy of spending. Why would we mortgage our future so a handful of companys can prosper in the near-term? That doesn't seem like conservativism. The very reason for anti-Liberal angst (out of controll spending) is the lifeblood of the current administration. Only this time the poor don't see the benefits. It is the mega-corporations getting our tax dollars without the oversight of the Congressional Budget Oversight Commitee.\\nIt all boils down to this: Aside from their left wing social views, Liberals are actually doing the work of the minority in any democracy. They are trying to balance the impulse of the current leadership to gorge on as much money and power as they can before their time is up.\\nThe rhetoric is so amusing. Those stupid Liberals. When will they ever learn? It seems our job as citizens isn't to think for ouselves but is to regurgitate the meaningless and empty words of our righteous benefactors the Neo-Conservative puppet masters. All of you Liberals and Conservatives should be thinking for youselves. It is a pity there are so many uneducated people in this country who speak so loudly.

It really depends on the slave owner during that era. Some slaves were treated badly there is no doubt about that but you must also remember that there is always two sides to a coin.  Not all slave owners were horrible to the slaves. In fact at one point when the slaves were freed some actually stayed with there owners and became crop sharers. Continuing to do what they were doing prior to being freed. \\n\\nI live in the south and am very proud to be southern.

This is an easy question and yet complex.  Every guys will want different things.  I like long hair, preferably red.  An attractive figure is also great.  Superficial acrostics aside, she needs to be able to carry a conversation.  I would rather have an average looking girl that is equally smart and can hold an intelligent conversation, rather than a perfect 10 that all guys drool over.  With a girl that is EXTREMELY beautiful you sometimes wonder if she is being faithful.  That takes allot of faith on the guys part to trust her  just as it takes trust for the girl to think the guys is not cheating.  If the girl can't say anything smart allot of people will look at her and think/know she is a ditz.  I know I am rambling on so, in my opinion intelligence, good looks, loyalty, willingness to compromise, horneyness.

The answers goes back many centuries.  In the past there was a  HUGE risk of miscarriage and death during birth due to poor medical practies.  Due to this birth rates were very low and there was a legitimate threat of a society dying out.  Religion, then, as it does now, attempted to fix a societal problem by outlawing masturbation in the hope that if they outlawed masturbation people would be more interested in the opposite sex, would have more sex, and hence create more babies, alleviating the concern that a population crisis (too few) would ensue.

It may average out between two students; one being superior to the other. But holding things equal all colleges are ranked and some are cosidered superior to others; the University of Pittsburgh is ranked superior. The real differance in undergrad diplomas is the amount of rigor you suject yourself to. For instance, a science degree is more respected by true itellectuals, followed in order by social science,buisiness and many parts of the humanities.
You've asked a BRILLIANT question. Indeed, if psychics "know all", why aren't they able to control their own lives, avoid accidents, get rich on stocks or the lottery? \\n\\nThe answer is clearly, they DON'T know "all", in fact, they don't know anything except how to bilk money out of gullible people. Commercial psychics use tricks of observation to ferret out "tells" (like in poker) about someone and make general statements that could apply to anyone similar to the poor deluded client. Using their powers of observation and generalizations about people, they tell the client amazingly accurate things that they figured out (no spirit doing the channeling, sorry.)\\n\\n Here's a prediction; despite being debunked, psychics will continue to have customers, because as Barnum said "A sucker is born every minute."

As a congressional candidate, I give you my answer:\\n\\nYes they are. The Fourth Amendment (and part of our Bill of Rights) states that there shall be no unreasonable search and seizure and that searches must have warrants. US Code also prohibits such wiretapping without a warrant issued by the court. It is ALL illegal that Bush is now doing. Just because he had his attorney general Gonzalez say it is legal--it is not. It would be as if his lawyer said it is now legal to rob banks with a gun. It is still illegal. \\nThe FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) authorizes wiretaps and has oversight and accountability. What Bush is doing has no oversight and can easily be abused and is abused and used against innocent Americans. If there is not enough protest, you can be sure that Bush will move on to bigger things.

Because of the very nature of stability in the universe.  There is balance in everything.  One could, for instance, take the Platonic argument of opposites - by virtue of the fact that there is a smart person on the internet, then, of course, for that person to be "smart", there has to be a "moron" for him/her to be measured against.  Or, one could take the darwin approach to things, and simply argue that as our bodies evolve, so do our minds, and some people are genetically inclied to be morons, hopefully to be sorted out in a few million years.  For more of a religious approach, one might consider that God, being God, and wanting love and adoration, would want man to come to God through its own volition, through faith, and not through absolute knowledge.  \\n\\nThe easy answer though is that computers are too damn cheap, and AOL will sign anyone up that has fingers to type on a keyboard (no offense to those with congenital defects, born without fingers, mind you).

At your young age, it would be best if you did not pursue marriage or children at this time; you will appreciate this advice later.

I'm a Christian, and think they are bigots and way off base.  If you really feel f****d, then see psychological counsel who is educated, but not working through some church.  Listen to his professional advice.  Often one session would do.  Also explore non-judgmental churches if you are Christian or interested.  The Episcopal Church is a good place to start.  They are welcoming and non-judgmental.  Some things are definitely between you and God, not the large haired ladies, and wild fanatics that visit this room so often to spew hate.  When in doubt, read John 3:16, feel secure and safe.  Watch out for the bigots, they can be murderers while preaching love.

This question is miscategorized. \\n\\nSpecial Education is about the education and parenting of children with special needs.\\n\\nThat being said...\\n\\nTo be a DJ in the United States, your doorway in is through practical experience. To get the practical experience, you need to try to get hired at a small station somewhere (small town or very low in the ratings in a city). You will need to apply at many stations to increase your odds of being hired. The other choice is to go to college, major in communications, and work at the college station. \\n\\nIf you are still in high school, take drama class and/or club, communications, technology class (you have GOT to get to know the equipment), and any video production class or club. Often, if you are in a small town, these teachers will either know people in radio, or BE people "moonlighting" at a local station (you won't know, neccessarily, because an on-air persona often has a different name and "sound" from the real person). Their word to the program director/general manager can get you in the door...but you must EARN that word... work hard in class and listen closely to what they have to teach.\\n\\nAs you look at these steps, keep in mind that a DJ is an entertainer, just like a musician, actor, or stand-up comedian. When you are auditioning for a station, you must show HOW you will keep your audience entertained and listening, while keeping the station's "feel" and "format" consistent. Regardless of the format you are interested in, be able to announce other kinds of music, anything from classical to rap, jazz to country.\\n\\n1. Create a "demo tape." Use the best quality equipment you can find, and tape yourself in a carpeted area to reduce "echo." You should make sure you're performance is strong enough to get their attention from the beginning (what is the most energetic personality you can show?). Give a short and direct introduction to a song, an in-depth introduction to a song, give the weather, read news copy (using the first, short paragraph from a newspaper article is ok for an audition), do a "commercial" for something, "interview" someone from the audience, etc. Each bit should not be longer than 30 seconds. The program director will probably not listen to all of it, but should get a feel for what you are currently able to do, how your voice sounds, etc.\\n\\nIf you are applying at several different stations, with different music formats, you should have a different tape for each format, to match the station style. \\n\\n2. Create a paper insert to go with your tape, that will keep the attention of the program director and make him/her curious enough to actually listen to your tape rather than toss it in the garbage. It should be simple and direct, show your personality (or personalities if you can do more than one), and be professional-quality.\\n\\n3. On your resume, given that you have no prior DJ experience, you want to show professionalism, creativity, and an understanding of both music and of how to work in front of an audience. Make sure, for references, to have respectable, working adults who can vouch for yor reliability (will you show up to work on time, do the best you can, etc.) and who know something about your knowledge of music. Once again, you want to appear both professional, and someone who stands out (in a positive way) from the crowd.\\n\\n4. Do NOT mail your demos. Hand-carry your demo to each station. Be well-dressed, and ensure that what you are wearing subtly reflects the format of the station (suit or dress for classical, casual Friday but with a jacket for alternative/soft, casual Friday with a Western touch for country, etc.). Ask to speak to the program director, and be prepared to WAIT for him/her in the front office. They WILL keep you waiting. If they ask you to come back, ask for an appointment. If you are stood up, ask for another one... You must show patience
Well, if we're gonna agree with them on that, how about they give Mexico back to the Aztecs and other tribes that owned it before the Spanish Conquistadores?

It is a long way from Star Trek, but teleportation - the disembodiment of an object in one location and its reconstruction in another - has been successfully carried out in a physics lab in Australia. \\nScientists at the Australian National University (ANU) made a beam of light disappear in one place and reappear in another a short distance away. \\n\\nWhen physicists teleported photons for the first time in 1997 they had to destroy the photons to be sure that the teleportation had been successful. Now a team at the University of Vienna has managed to teleport photons without destroying them. Jian-Wei Pan and colleagues believe that their method could be the next step towards long-distance quantum communication (J-W Pan et al. 2003 Nature 421 721).\\n\\nIn quantum teleportation the sender, normally called Alice, instantaneously transfers the quantum state of a particle to a receiver, called Bob. In most experiments so far Alice has teleported the quantum state of a photon - defined in terms of its polarization - to Bob. The photon itself is not transferred: rather Bob’s photon acquires exactly the same polarization as Alice’s. The uncertainty principle means that Alice cannot know the exact state of her photon, but another feature of quantum mechanics called “entanglement” means that this is not an obstacle to teleporting the state to Bob. \\n\\nQuantum entanglement essentially allows two particles to behave as one, regardless of how far apart they are. Photons can be entangled so that if one is vertically polarized, for instance, then the other photon in the pair is always horizontally polarized. \\n\\nIn a standard teleportation experiment a laser is directed at a crystal with nonlinear optical properties. Occasionally the photon will be “down-converted” into two lower energy photons, and sometimes these photons will have their polarizations entangled. In a teleportation experiment the beam is reflected back through the crystal to sometimes produce a second pair of entangled photons. By convention the photons in the first pair are labelled 2 and 3 (for mode 2 and mode 3), and those in the second pair are 1 and 4. Photons 1 and 2 are directed to Alice, photon 3 is sent to Bob and photon 4 is used as a trigger. A variety of mirrors, beamsplitters and polarizers are used to direct the photons to four detectors labelled D1, D2, D3 and T (for trigger). \\n\\nThe aim of the experiment is to transfer, or teleport, the polarization of photon 1 to photon 3. This is normally done by making a joint measurement on photons 1 and 2 which changes the polarization of the latter in such a way that photon 3 - which is entangled with it - always acquires the same polarization as the first photon. In other words the quantum state of photon 1 - which was unknown to Alice - has been teleported to photon 3. \\n\\nThe experiment was set up such that detectors D1, D2 and T all register photons at the same time when teleportation takes place. However, under certain circumstances - the emission of two photons each into modes 1 and 4 - it is possible for the same three detectors to register events even though there is no photon in mode 3 to teleport to. These spurious events mean that the D3 detector must also register - and destroy - a photon to be sure that teleportation has taken place. \\n\\nBy using a filter to reduce the intensity of the photons that are going to be teleported the researchers were able to significantly reduce the number of spurious detection events. The Vienna team could be 97% certain that the state had been teleported to photon 3 without actually having to detect it. Such a high accuracy means that the teleported photons could be used in “quantum repeaters” for long distance communication. The team now hopes to combine these results with a technique known as “entanglement purification” to further develop quantum communication over long distances.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe achievement confirms that in theory teleportation is possible, at
Humans have the following blood types along with their respective antigens and antibodies:\\n\\n    * Individuals with type A blood have red blood cells with antigen A on their surface and produce antibodies against antigen B in their blood serum. Therefore an A-negative person can only receive blood from another A-negative person or from an O-negative person.\\n    * Individuals with type B blood have the opposite arrangement, antigen B on their cells and produce antibodies against antigen A in their serum. Therefore, a B-negative person can only receive blood from another B-negative person or from an O-negative person.\\n    * Individuals with type AB blood have red blood cells with both antigens A and B and do not produce antibodies against either antigen in their serum. Therefore, a person with type AB-positive blood can safely receive any ABO type blood and is called a "universal receiver". However an AB-positive person cannot donate blood except to another AB-positive person.\\n    * Individuals with type O blood have red blood cells with neither antigen but produce antibodies against both types of antigens. Therefore, a person with type O-negative blood can safely donate to a person with any ABO blood type and is called a "universal donor". However an O-negative person can only receive blood from another O-negative person.\\n\\nOverall, the O blood type is the most common blood type in the world, although in some areas, such as Sweden and Norway, the A group dominates. The A antigen is overall more common than the B antigen. Since the AB blood type requires the presence of both A and B antigens, the AB blood type is the rarest of the ABO blood types. There are known racial and geographic distributions of the ABO blood types. \\n\\nThe precise reason why people develop antibodies against an antigen they have never been exposed to is unknown. It is believed that some bacterial antigens are similar enough to the A and B glycoproteins, and that antibodies created against the bacteria will react to ABO-incompatible blood cells.\\n\\nApart from red blood cells, the ABO antigen is also expressed on the glycoprotein von Willebrand factor (vWF), which participates in hemostasis (control of bleeding). In fact, blood type O predisposes very slightly to bleeding, as vWF is degraded more rapidly. ABO antigens are also present in many other tissues such as liver, kidneys and lungs\\n\\nThe H antigen:\\nThe A & B antigens are derived from a common precursor known as the H antigen. The H antigen is a glycosphingolipid (sphingolipid with carbohydrates bonded to the ceramide moiety) which is modified to produce the A and B antigens. In type O blood, it remains unchanged and consists of a chain of glucose, galactose, N-acetyl galactosamine, and fucose attached to the ceramide. Since it lacks N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) it is referred to as a globoside, not a ganglioside. Type A has an extra N-acetyl galactosamine bonded to the galactose near the end, while type B has a third galactose bonded to that near-end galactose.

Me too i work in a news agents and im working all over xmas but luckily not xmas day. We were given the choice whether we wanted to open xmas day or not and we chose NO. If people haven't got what they want by then its tough luck. I have worked on xmas day a few times in previous years and i just found people un-grateful and still moaned about things. And when it came to lock up time they were banging on the door saying they only wanted a few bits and could we let them in (forgetting we had a family and a xmas to go and enjoy). Three most popular items xmas day are fags, booze and batteries.\\nAny way merry xmas to every one (bit early i know)
All sorts, you can work in chemisty field, you can work in medical laboratories, you can flip burgers, (I assume you don't want to do that, but it sure does taste good),\\n\\nhere are a few more \\n\\nAnalytical chemistry is the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their chemical composition and structure. Analytical chemistry incorporates standardized experimental methods in chemistry. These methods may be used in all subdisciplines of chemistry, excluding purely theoretical chemistry. \\nBiochemistry is the study of the chemicals, chemical reactions and chemical interactions that take place in living organisms. Biochemistry and organic chemistry are closely related, for example, in medicinal chemistry. \\n \\nA chemist prepares a new fuel cell for testing.Inorganic chemistry is the study of the properties and reactions of inorganic compounds. The distinction between organic and inorganic disciplines is not absolute and there is much overlap, most importantly in the sub-discipline of organometallic chemistry. \\nMedicinal chemistry is the science involved with designing, synthesizing and developing pharmaceutical drugs. Medicinal chemistry involves the identification, synthesis and development of new chemical entities suitable for therapeutic use. It also includes the study of existing drugs, their biological properties, and their quantitative structure-activity relationships. \\nOrganic chemistry is the study of the structure, properties, composition, mechanisms, and reactions of organic compounds. \\nPhysical chemistry is the study of the physical fundamental basis of chemical systems and processes. In particular, the energetics and dynamics of such systems and processes are of interest to physical chemists. Important areas of study include chemical thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, electrochemistry,quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, and spectroscopy. Physical chemistry has large overlap with theoretical chemistry and molecular physics. Physical chemistry involves the use of calculus in deriving equations. \\nTheoretical chemistry is the study of chemistry via theoretical reasoning (usually within mathematics or physics). In particular the application of quantum mechanics to chemistry is called quantum chemistry. Since the end of the second world war, the development of computers has allowed a systematic development of computational chemistry, which is the art of developing and applying computer programs for solving chemical problems. Theoretical chemistry has large overlap with condensed matter physics and molecular physics.See Reductionism.

This season (season 7) is DEFINITELY the last season. You win the bet, your husband loses!\\n\\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, it's official. The Sopranos is finished after this upcoming season which begins March 12th.\\n\\nDavid Chase, creator and executive producer of the HBO hit series, assured critics Friday at the Television Critics Assn. winter press tour that he won't be coaxed back for more after the 20 episodes he is working on are completed. "That will be the end", Chase said. "Definitely".\\n\\nThe previous season of Sopranos was intended to be the final episodes, but HBO managed to lure Chase back for more. Twelve new episodes unspool in March, followed by the final eight episodes in January 2007. Chase even scotched the perennial speculation that HBO could produce a theatrical version of the show.

Yes, religion exists. For example, in Russia before the fall of communism, although religion was banned from practice, people did meet to discuss god, faith and religion. If a priest was present, they would also perform a liturgy and receive communion.\\n\\nHere is a story: There was a town in communist Russia. The local government asked for all the people to meet at the local sports arena/field. The people were told they are communists, long live communism, this is what you now believe, etc., etc. So everyone is like "okay...whatever you say," but not much more. Then a government official asks if anyone has any questions. An old man around 80 stands up and comes down to the podium. All he says to the crowd is "Christ is risen!" EVERYONE in the crowd shouts back, "Yes, truly He is risen!"\\n\\nThe power of faith never dies no matter what others try to force on you.

It does depend one where he's at on the spectrum, but it also depends on what you're talking about as far as what he does. As with any child, the form of discipline depends on the actions causing the discipline. Especially at 1 1/2, that's a tough one. My almost 4 yr old is autistic, he was just starting to really show signs at 1 1/2. You can do timeouts, but you might have to sit there with him if he doesn't understand he's supposed to stay there. If you're talking about tantrums, that's a fun one! The best way to handle the tantrums at that age is one of two ways. The first way was given to me by a special ed teacher. Place him on your lap facing out, and gently but firmly hold his arms until he stops. This works if he's hurting himself or others, like mine was. It was the only way to keep him from biting himself and drawing blood or digging his claws into himself. The other way is less extreme, it's for when he's tantruming but doesn't hurt himself. Make sure he's out of everyone's reach and just let him do it. Keep in mind, they can last a long time, mine would usually go for 30 min. a piece. Usually, they're in such a rage when it happens that they don't even know you exist, so disciplining him while he's doing it won't do any good. Believe me, I tried! When he gets a little older, you can use the happy face/sad face. This is working WONDERS for my son now, but it wouldn't have then. If he can stop himself from having a tantrum before it starts, or if he can do what I ask without fighting, he gets a happy face. If he tantrums or fights me, he gets a sad face. At the end of the day, before he goes home, give him a special treat. If he likes trains, find some train stickers, etc. This is helping Tim to learn self-control, to stop himself and get control before he's out of control. Again, depends on how severe this little guy is as to whether or not he can comprehend a reward system.
I think that sanitary conditions matter more than appearance.  If a restaurant is tiny and shabby, but immaculate, than no, you should'nt pay mind.  The very best Mexican food I have ever eaten is served in a tiny little hole in the wall next to train tracks in a industrial part of Maryland.  And on the other hand, I've had "microwave food" in some of the most trendy restaurants in town.
The summer solstice is the longest day of the year, respectively, in the sense that the length of time elapsed between sunrise and sunset on this day is a maximum for the year. Of course, daylight saving time means that the first Sunday in April has 23 hours and the last Sunday in October has 25 hours, but these human meddlings with the calendar and do not correspond to the actual number of daylight hours. In Chicago, there are 15:02 hours of daylight on the summer solstice of June 21, 1999.

Pullups/chinups. Not only does it work the biceps, but also your lats and shoulders. A lot of back exercises work the biceps too. Barbell or dumbbell rows, cable rows, lat pulldowns will all work your biceps. And squats. It may sound strange, but squats are great for a full body workout. Your body releases a ton of growth hormones just from squats alone, that all your muscles benefit.\\n\\nAnd don't forget to work your triceps too. They do make up 2/3 of your upper arm, and having well shaped tri's can really make your arms look great!\\n\\nThe link below is an article called "How Can A Bodybuilder Add Inches To The Arms In The Shortest Time?"

Centriptal Force\\n\\nAny motion in a curved path represents accelerated motion, and requires a force directed toward the center of curvature of the path. This force is called the centripetal force which means "center seeking" force. The force has the magnitude\\n\\nSwinging a mass on a string requires string tension, and the mass will travel off in a tangential straight line if the string breaks.\\n\\nThe centripetal acceleration can be derived for the case of circular motion since the curved path at any point can be extended to a circle.\\n\\nNote that the centripetal force is proportional to the square of the velocity, implying that a doubling of speed will require four times the centripetal force to keep the motion in a circle. If the centripetal force must be provided by friction alone on a curve, an increase in speed could lead to an unexpected skid if friction is insufficient.

they might not know better yet. kids learn from their parents, but they are not tied to what they've been taught. when they get older, if they are willing to see the world as it is, and lay aside the prejudices they've been brought up with, then they can become their own person. my own parents are hardly evil, but they go about their lives in a way that i have found to be unsatisfactory. i never realized this until the past few years, when i moved out of the house and made my own life. now, i'm trying to identify and utilize the good lessons they taught me over the years, and rid myself of the harmful or useless. it's not easy, but it also isn't impossible. no kid "has" to be so mean; they choose to.

Angels are spiritual beings created by God to serve Him, though created higher than man. Some, the good angels, have remained obedient to Him and carry out His will, while others, fallen angels, disobeyed, fell from their holy position, and now stand in active opposition to the work and plan of God. The holy angels are messengers of God, serving Him and doing His bidding. The fallen angels serve Satan, the god of this world (2 Corinthians 4:4). \\n\\nThe doctrine of angels follows logically the doctrine of Christ, for the angels are primarily ministers of Christ's providence. When areas of theology are slighted, this will likely be one of them. One has only to peruse the amount of space devoted to angelology in standard theologies to demonstrate this. This disregard for the doctrine may simply be neglect or it may indicate a tacit rejection of this area of Biblical teaching.\\n\\nA careful study of Angelology, we will examine the following:\\n1. Terms used of angels; \\n2. The existence of angels; \\n3. The creation of angels; \\n4. The nature of angels; \\n5. The classification of angels; \\n6. The ranking of angels; \\n7. The ministry of angels; \\n8. The identity of the Angel of the LORD [Jehovah]; \\n9. The identity of the sons of God in Genesis 6:1-8; and \\n10. The role of angels in medieval Jewish thought (optional). \\n\\nThe terms used of angels are as follows: \\n1. Angels; \\n2. Holy ones; \\n3. Host; \\n4. Chariots; \\n5. Watchers; \\n6. The Angel of the LORD [Yahweh or Jehovah]; \\n7. Elohim; \\n8. Stars; and sons of God. \\n\\nThough other words are used for these spiritual beings, the primary word used in the Bible is angel. The Hebrew word for angel is mal`ach, and the Greek word is angelos. Both words mean "messenger" and describe one who executes the purpose and will of the one whom they serve. The context must determine if a human messenger is in view, or one of the celestial beings called "angels," or if it is being used of the second Person of the Trinity as will be discussed below. \\n\\nIllustrations of uses that do not refer to celestial beings: \\n\\n1. For human messengers from one human to another (Luke 7:24; James 2:25). \\n2. For human messengers bearing a divine message (Haggai 1:13; Galatians 4:14). \\n3. For an impersonal agent, Paul's thorn in the flesh described as "a messenger of Satan" (2 Corinthians 12:7). \\n4. For the messengers of the seven churches (Revelation 2-3). It is also used in connection with the seven churches of Asia, "To the angel of the church in ..." Some take this to mean a special messenger or delegation to the church as a teaching elder, others take it to refer to a guardian angel. \\n\\nThus, the term angelos is not only a generic term, pertaining to a special order of beings (i.e., angels), but it is also descriptive and expressive of their office and service. So when we read the word "angel" we should think of it in this way\\n\\nHoly Ones\\n\\nThe un-fallen angels are also spoken of as "holy ones" (Psalm 89:5, 7). The reason is twofold. First, being the creation of a holy God, they were created perfect without any flaw or sin. Second, they are called holy because of their purpose. They were "set apart" by God and for God as His servants and as attendants to His holiness (cf. Isa 6).\\n\\nHost\\n\\n"Host" is the Hebrew tsaba, "army, armies, hosts." It is a military term and carries the idea of warfare. Angels are referred to as the "host," which calls our attention to two ideas. First, it is used to describe God's angels as the "armies of heaven" who serve in the army of God engaged in spiritual warfare (Psalm 89:6, 8; 1 Samuel 1:11; 17:45). Second, it calls our attention to angels as a multitude of heavenly beings who surround and serve God as seen in the phrase "Lord of hosts" (Isaiah 31:4). In addition, tsaba sometimes includes the host of heavenly bodies, the stars of the univ

Lots of misconceptions on this subject.  Let me try and clear up a few.\\n\\nBush ordered the release of these documents against the advice of John Negroponte.  Senators Hoekstra and Roberts, both Republicans, wanted this information released to the public for political reasons to try and help their case that there were WMD in Iraq.  According to David Kay, head weapons inspector, these were documents that were retrieved prior to 1991 and were already known about before W invaded Iraq.\\n\\nSecond year nuclear physics majors do not have all the information needed to build a nuclear bomb, let alone a regular physics major.  This information was not previously available on the internet, that is an urban myth.\\n\\nThere is no doubt that Saddam was a future threat, but there is still no evidence that he was an imminent threat.\\n\\nThese are the facts.
A free enterprise economy is where the market forces of supply and demand determine the price of goods and services. So, if you wanted 10 pineapples and fifty other people wanted them as well, and there were 10 pineapples then the pineapples would go to the person who is willing to pay the most for them. But let's say that there are two people and you only want one pineapple and there were fifty on the market, then the pineapple's price would be determined by who was offering the pineapple for sale for the least amount of money.

A good place to start would be the Shanghai area since you are going there.

To succeed in a case such as this three things must be shown: There was a duty of care owed, this duty of care was breached and the damage resulted from that breach. All employers owe a duty of care to their employees, in the U.K this includes adequate training, supervision and competent colleagues. Provided he was actually an employee and not a contractor or self employed then a duty of care can be presumed and in this case the remaining two conditions will be fulfilled. \\n\\nI am presuming that your solicitor will be suing in Tort (negligence). I remember a few years ago, there was a book which detailed what one would receive for a certain injury, I'll see if I can dig it out to give you an idea so check back in a few days. The amount you will receive in damages depends on a number of different factors though and is subject to enhancement or reduction for several reasons, i.e the severity of the damage and the impact this will have on his daily life etc and also whether the employer manages to atribute any contributory negligence to your husband. Your husband should also receive any back pay which he may be owed as a result of missing work and any other out of pocket expenses (i.e. travel costs for hospital appointments).

There was no country called Canada in 1840.  Canada became a country in 1867, and of course not all the provinces that are part of Canada today joined Confederation at that time.  Part of what is now Canada was considered the province of Canada, a colony of Britain in 1840.  So you would need to specify what you mean.

The answer "dbl and add 30" is incorrect.\\n\\nA simple way that is 100% accurate is to double the C temperature, then subtract 1/10 of that number, then add 32.\\n\\nFor instance: 18 degrees C; double that and you have 36; subtract 1/10 of 36: 36 - 3.6 = 32.4.  Now add 32.4 + 32 = 64.4.
I owe LOT to the other veterans that went before me.  To my dad, who served in WWII and the Korean War.  To the many who never made it home.  To the POWs who are still lost today.

Check your cable connections to make sure they are all tightened and secure. If you have a cell phone near your TV move it away, some services (like Cingular) interfere with a lot of monitors.\\n\\nYou may need a new splitter for your connection in your cable box or your signal might be weak or noisy -- these are problems with your cable provider and they usually come out and check for free if you can't figure the problem out yourself.

Because there is a HUGE double standard in this world. Unfortunately, it is the woman that has to carry the baby and usually is the one with the custody if the pregnancy was unplanned and the boyfriend ditched her.  It is a shame and I feel sorry for any woman in that situation and curse the bastard that left her!  Society looks at the woman as loose and the man as virile, which makes no sense to me as they both are doing wrong by the child.

I listen to Conservative and Liberal radio. I can't believe people really think the BS that the Conservatives dish out are facts. I love to listen to Michael Savage. He cracks me up. He is the most extreme and amusing of the conservative hosts. Rush is such a pom pas ass that I can only take him in small doses, no pun intended. Hannity is such a nasally annoyance I can't believe he still has a job. Although I do enjoy his I hate Hannity calls. I wish people could learn to think for themselves and listen to radio programs to be entertained, not get the Republican talking points shoved in their heads.

Most mammals will produce tears in response to extreme pain or other stimuli, but crying as an emotional reaction is considered by many to be a uniquely human phenomenon, possibly due to humans' advanced self-awareness. Some studies suggest that elephants and gorillas may cry as well.\\n\\nIn nearly all cultures, crying is seen as a specific act associated with tears trickling down the cheeks and accompanied by characteristic sobbing sounds. Emotional triggers are most often anger and grief, but crying can also be triggered by sadness, joy, fear, humor, etc.\\n\\nIn many cultures, crying is associated with babies and children. Some cultures consider crying to be undignified and infantile, casting aspersion on those who cry publicly. In most western cultures, it is more socially acceptable for women to cry in public than men, but this is certainly not true for all human cultures.\\n\\nAn insincere display of grief or dishonest remorse is called crocodile tears, from the ancient anecdote that crocodiles would pretend to weep in order to lure prey [2].\\n\\nMany religions describe gods or prophets as crying:\\n\\nThe shortest verse in the Bible (in the King James Version of the Bible and some other English translations) is simply: "Jesus wept." \\nJade is sometimes known as "tears of the Buddha". \\nThe Qur'an describes Muhammad crying, and proclaiming: "This is an expression of the tenderness and compassion, which the Lord hath put into the hearts of His servants." \\nThe Incas believed that silver was the "tears of the moon". \\n\\nMy readings

Choosing interfaces and abstract classes is not an either/or proposition. If you need to change your design, make it an interface. However, you may have abstract classes that provide some default behavior. Abstract classes are excellent candidates inside of application frameworks.\\n\\nAbstract classes let you define some behaviors; they force your subclasses to provide others. For example, if you have an application framework, an abstract class may provide default services such as event and message handling. Those services allow your application to plug in to your application framework. However, there is some application-specific functionality that only your application can perform. Such functionality might include startup and shutdown tasks, which are often application-dependent. So instead of trying to define that behavior itself, the abstract base class can declare abstract shutdown and startup methods. The base class knows that it needs those methods, but an abstract class lets your class admit that it doesn't know how to perform those actions; it only knows that it must initiate the actions. When it is time to start up, the abstract class can call the startup method. When the base class calls this method, Java calls the method defined by the child class.\\n\\nMany developers forget that a class that defines an abstract method can call that method as well. Abstract classes are an excellent way to create planned inheritance hierarchies. They're also a good choice for nonleaf classes in class hierarchies.

I think looking at the strengths of your location might be the best option.  If you live in a city, try outings to parks or museums or other unorthodox habitats.\\n\\nArt is also an interesting way to promote self exploration and expression.  Have them use any style, abstraction, colours or media.  Maybe even look at how to bring street art into their work to make a link with urban movements.\\n\\nAnother approach may be photography; as right now everyone has a camera in one form or another.  The camera phone movie challenge is always interesting and again, it promotes a lot of self exploration.\\n\\nThere are a lot of other activities that can be encouraged, but I dare not bore you.  I hope these suggestion could at least be a catalyst for more ideas.
Try hanging out with eachother more so you will get to no eachother more and eventually feel more comfortable around eachother. Of course at first you will both be nervous, but just loosten up go one step at a time. Your first step should not be only with her go to the movies with her and 2 other friends. That way it will be less tense because it wont just be the 2 of you. then the next time you can go somewere together alone. eventually you will feel more comfortable.

I don't understand what people mean when they say it's not "natural."  Natural means something that exists in nature... homosexuality is naturally occuring, therefore it is natural.  Homosexuality is frequently seen among other primate species, not to mention that it has always been a part of human culture (whether openly or not).  What do you mean by not "natural?"  It happens in nature, therefore it can't be not natural.  I just don't get that argument.  \\n\\nI do think that same sex marriages should be legal, I don't think that there's a substantive difference between "unions" and "marriage"--it's not all in the name, there's nothing in the name but pointless bigotry, and haven't we already been through "separate but equal"?  And I don't get how legalizing same sex marriage would be the end of society.  Nobody has yet explained that to me, except to say that in Norway they have legalized gay marriage and more Norwegian kids are now born out of wedlock.  What the connection is there, I'm not sure, and why it's bad for kids to be born out of wedlock, I'm not sure either, as long as they have a loving home.

The first step in trying to understand the vastness of space is in the ability to equate it with the understanding in the size (length, width, height, volume) of a point.  Both are equally unfathomable and for similar reasons.  You can think of our universe as an expanding point where we are inside.  Everywhere you are inside of the universe(that is not within close proximity of other objects for the effect of gravity to express itself) you will notice everything is expanding away from you.  \\n\\nI believe what you are considering space is what I see as our universe.  Our universe is what we can view, touch and explain through science we have developed.  Space on the other hand is an infinitely dimensional medium, in which our universe was born.  \\n\\nOur universe is nothing more than a 'disturbance' in space, and in space our universe exists as a point.  This point is a fraction of infinity, yet everything is a fraction of infinity.  So in the humble realization that we are nothing (a fraction of infinity), we are abstractly enlightened by the fact that we are equal to everything we can fathom, as it too is a fraction of infinity no matter how large.\\n\\nSo, through the realization that we are nothing comes the discovery that we are everything.  \\n\\nI believe this means everything that makes up the universe and space has its own existence or presence known to space and must exist.  The disappearance, or non-existance of any defined object and its position in space no matter how small, down to a point, would truly have mind boggling consequences.

Recent history shows that more gets done when power is shared between the two parties.  Reagan got major economic legislation passed by a Democratic Congress.  Clinton got the deficit under control with a Republican Congress.  My theory is that when one party controls both the White House and the Congress, they are reluctant to take risks because they have no one else to blame for a failure.  When the parties share power, they both take the blame/credit for failures and successes.  I think this new Congress will take this opportunity to get something done.

Good question.  I think alot of it has to do with the standardized tests that are focused mostly on math and language arts.  In the school where I teach, the 5th grade teachers have to choose whether they are going to teach science or social studies on a day-to-day basis.  We've become fixated on bringing up test scores in math and reading (thanks to No Child Left Behind), that the rest of it has to take a back seat.
Pastors get paid...They do a job for the church usually under contract. (That's why most get a house, and other stuff to boot. It's part of the pay.) So when they get old and don't want to Pastor anymore they retire...It doesn't mean they don't preach anymore it just means they don't get paid for it.\\n\\nThe rest you mentioned usually do those things just because they want to. They don't get paid and are volunteers. They have a calling and decide to serve their chuch by contributing what they can. And no they don't retire but some just quit when they don't want to do it anymore or when they find a replacement or when they die. So they, in a sense, do retire at some point in one way or another.

My bf confessed to me that he liked wearing girls clothes. At first I was shocked but then accepted it because I love him. Plus he was hurting no one. At least once a month I dress him in diffrent outfits. He seems sweeter when dressed up like a girl. I especially like him in a mini skirt and see through blouse with high heels, pantyhose and proper undies. I do his makeup too. He is straight and together we have a great time. I plan on taking him shopping while he is dress in a cute pleated skirt and black flats for his birthday. He has great legs and can now pass as a girl. He has a number of wigs too. It is all in fun and we really do have a great time. He can be very macho too. And I would not trade him for anybody. And I respect him for being so honest with me and for being himself!

If enough is enough and you absolutely want to move on then.. yes move out  or make him move back home. \\nIf he made a choice to move in with you then he should do his part. Id suggest talking to him, finding out whats the deal, telling him he needs to do more around the place or get a better job. Why is he uncapable of being the guy he once was...? Motivation can be really rough of an issue but its something that can absolutely change a relationship...\\nWhat are his goals? what does he want for you two? does he plan to be their like he is in 5years... whats he doing to not be their?\\nAttempt to set goals (realistic ones) with him and let him know that its important.. write them down.. things you want to change and where you want to be at. If he doesnt work towards them forcem out!\\n\\nLook up some ways to motivate a boyfriend/husband.. its pretty common that people fall into an unhappy state. \\n\\nand ultimately never stay with someone becuase you fear hurting them, its unhealthy for you and him.

The theme song for Half & Half is sung by the gospel singer Tonex and Shanice Wilson (married to Flex Alexander of One on One)..... Actor and comedian FLEX ALEXANDER of the UPN sitcom One on One, and his wife, R&B singer SHANICE, enjoy an outing in Los Angeles with their 1-year-old daughter, IMANI SHEKINAH, their first child.

Lisps are naturally occuring condition caused by the tongue and its contact with the teeth or the palate, depending on if it is a dental or palatal problem.

It is not easy to start out with, but the more you stand for Jesus the easier it becomes.  You may want to just not say anything to start with, but with time, you will find that you will not be able to keep from saying something.  And most of all put yourself in Jesus' hands and He will put the words in your mouth.  Always depend on Jesus or you will foul up every time.  First you have to pray for the person, that the Holy Spirit will work to open that persons heart to what you share with them.  That's all that you can do.  From there the Holy Spirit will point that person to Jesus Christ.  We must realize that we ourselves can't save anyone, we just plant the seed.  You may never know if what you shared has any effect on that person, but just knowing that what you did was right thing will make you want to share with someone else.  The greatest feeling you will ever have is seeing someone come to Christ and realizing you planted the seed.  Knowing in your heart that this person will not spend eternity in hell.  If you would happen to see this shared testimony through and see the other person saved, don't get filled with pride.  Remember pride comes before a fall.  And also remember when you do share, don't talk down to them, be humble and just state whatever you feel that Jesus is leading you to say.  Don't get mad and lose you temper if they reject what you say, just knowing that you tried is what matters.
You're an idiot.
While reading a lot of what people post and answer on here, I feel dismayed that so many people are not only "okay" with the status quo, but they harass, label and judge those who question it.\\n\\nI despise it when people answer something "b/c it's against the law," well that's just fantastic, but it's not a valid answer.  When growing up, did anybody like it when their parents said "b/c i said so." Nope!\\n\\nPeople, I have found, are reluctant to invite controversy, to debate and to use their minds openly and freely.  It's absolutely fine to agree w/ the establishment, but it's also ok to disagree; the people who make the laws are working for us, don't forget that.  These laws are meant for our benefit, to protect us and maintain a stable society - not to keep us opressed and under their submission (yeah, I know it's hard to believe that sometimes).\\n\\nSo to whom ever reads this and the person who posted this question, I hope that Americans start realizing that 1) the media have their own money/power-making agendas, and delivering truth is a biproduct 2) there are two sides to every story 3) criticizing the status quo is not the equivalent of becoming a rebel anarchist...it's simply using the brain that you were born with.

As far as I know there is no such thing as "pharmaceutical grade" for any reagent.  Reagents exist in hundreds of specific and defined 'grades'.  The pharmaceutical industry uses a wide variety of different grades of reagents.  Isopropanol, for example, would probably be used as an 'ACS grade', 'HPLC grade' or 'USP grade'.  The grade required would depend on the specific use or purpose of the reagent.  Is it being used for cleaning?  to dissolve something in solution?  as a reagent in analytical analysis?  As far as I know, there is no general 'pharmaceutical grade.'\\nReagent grades specifically define purity and impurity levels of a given reagent.  There are many many different grades!\\n\\nTry searching "reagent grades" on the Internet to get a better idea of all the different grades available.
Yes, I think it is time to move on.

Try http://www.dol.gov for the Department of Labor.\\nIf you are representaed by any organized labor (paying member or not), you must work through them before bringing litigation.\\nIf you were to try to prove an Unfair Labor Practice occurred, you would need to show that your employer violated a company rule or a law. This is usually very difficult since any potential witnesses are typically other employees and have a lot to lose by testifying against their employer. Also, your company will mount a vigorous defense, so expect them to say awful things about your performance in court. Not a pretty sight.\\nIf you don't have any evidence to show another person or official, you might be better off finding a new position. If your company has a Human Resources department, ask them to review the termination; their job is to protect the company from lawsuits and if they smell one coming on, they may work with you to prevent trouble.

I listen to Conservative and Liberal radio. I can't believe people really think the BS that the Conservatives dish out are facts. I love to listen to Michael Savage. He cracks me up. He is the most extreme and amusing of the conservative hosts. Rush is such a pom pas ass that I can only take him in small doses, no pun intended. Hannity is such a nasally annoyance I can't believe he still has a job. Although I do enjoy his I hate Hannity calls. I wish people could learn to think for themselves and listen to radio programs to be entertained, not get the Republican talking points shoved in their heads.
As we say in HR - there is nothing illegal about being an a**hole.\\n\\nAs long as his verbal abuse is not motivated based on a protected reason (age, sex, race, etc) there is nothing technically "illegal" about it.\\n\\nThat doesn't make it right.  I'd suggest talking to your HR department, if you want to go that route.  You're likely to stir up some bru-ha-ha. Document times, dates, and content of the inappropriate interactions he has with you, because you will be asked to articulate your complaint.  "My boss is mean to me" isn't going to cut it.\\n\\nOther than that, about the only thing you can do is look for another job or post to another postion internally.  You can quit and try for UI, which under the circumstance you might or might not get.  Again, they also usually like to see that you tried to solve the problem with in the company before up and quitting.

I live in Indiana and trust me Jermaine's staying. Only way he'll go is if the Pacers get a trade they can pass up. Only possibilities to me are Chicago.  Some reports have the Bulls packaging Chandler, Ben Gordon and the No. 2 pick to the Wolves for Garnett or to the Pacers for O'Neal.\\nI just moved to Minnesota and also Kevin Garnett is most liekly staying. he is the centerpiece ofthe franchise and city and there's no way he'll go. Don't be too surprised if J.O and K.G get swapped for each other though. ALlen iverson seems the most likely to be traded.I can see the Celtics or the HAwks picking him up. But the big deal floating around is Iverson to the Boston Celtics, Boozer to the 76ers and Szczerbiak to the Utah Jazz.
The Netherlands does not give citizenship based on place of birth, only by the nationality of the parents. If your mother was a dual Canadian and Dutch citizen, you would be a Dutch citizen automatically, but there are many ways you could lose it by staying out of the Kingdom for a long enough period of time. Regardless of all that, your mother's Canadian citizenship gives you Candian citizenship automatically. In either case, you do not need to apply for the additional citizenships, but provide proof of your claim citizenship when applying for something like a passport.
I think that would be a good idea.  American citizens need to show a counter opinion to the recent protests of the illegal immigrants.  The squeakiest wheel gets the grease!  If legal American citizens do not voice their opinions, government will believe that the majority of Americans are okay with illegal immigration in the USA.

Have you ever heard of the saying 'Once bitten, twice shy'? To me it makes sense.Personally I have a rule which is to never get back with someone I have broke up with weather it was an amicable break up or not.I made this rule for myself cos I have experienced it and the second time around it hurt even more than it did the first time.I've also watched my friends relationships when they have broke up with someone and then got back with them.Sooner or later the problem comes back.It might be 2 years or it might be 2 weeks but it does eventually come back.But that is only my experiences - it may be different for you.Hope everything works out for you.Good luck

I'm cool with lesbians. I think every state should allow gay marriage. They way I see it, marriage is a union between two people that love each other, no matter the sex of those people.
Checkmate (frequently shortened to mate) is a situation in chess (and in other boardgames of the chaturanga family) in which one player's king is under attack and there is no way to meet that threat; it is a check from which there is no escape. The king is never actually captured—the game ends as soon as the king is checkmated. A player who is checkmated loses the game. Delivering checkmate is the ultimate goal in chess (although not all games end in checkmate often a player resigns before checkmate is administered, or the game may end in a draw in several ways).
As far as practicing law in the US, you would need to pass the bar exam in the jurisdiction where you wanted to practice.  The qualifications to sit the bar vary from state to state so you'd need to contact the State Bar where you wanted to practice.\\n\\nThere's another alternative that might be of interest, especially if your are of expertise is in business law.  Many American corporations have subsidiaries or production facilities in foreign countries.  They need to ensure that they don't violate local laws and their American staff attorneys are pretty useless for this.  You could be valuable to them if they have facilities in your native country, particularly if you have strong English skills.

Odd, because Wellbutrin is well known for its lesser tendency to have sexual side effects.

ask him to help out! sometimes guys think you have everything under control, and they just dont know what you would want them to do! I know in my moms case, she is so picky about how she wants things done in the house that she scares my dad and brother AWAY from helping!\\nTalk to him and tell him that you are starting to feel burned out. Ask if maybe he can take a couple of nights a week to cook dinner, or if there is a way to make it clear to him what needs to be done, like by setting a specific day every week for laundry or cleaning each specific room or whatever. \\nKeeping quiet on this will only make you resentful, which will make your marriage more strained. Talk to him about it and present it in a very unaccusing manner...asking for his help as opposed to telling him what to do should help!\\nGood luck!
Because people can be very ignorant about certain things, and very closed- minded.  Being overweight can be caused by many things, but even unfortunately news stories you hear, all they talk about is people being overweight because of overeating- they don't mention those of us who are overweight because of other reasons. I am the same way myself- not overweight by choice, and no medical problems except being overweight, and exercise does nothing for my weight at all.  I eat no junk food and don't overeat at all but I just have a sluggish metabolism.
I had a cracked tooth once, and I went through a filling first (will no relief), then a root canal (with no relief again), and finally I told my dentist to just pull the tooth (because I couldn't take the pain anymore).  If you haven't felt any better results by Monday go back again, or seek another dentist.  I was told that once you have a cracked tooth, there's basically nothing they can do for it.  Have it pulled--if it's in an unnoticeable area (mine was the very back tooth), before you go through all of the pain and expense I did.

Sounds like you have it bad for her. All i can suggest is as long as it is to be a long distance relationship, write her an email every day...... no more than one, unless she responds.... telling her how your day went, how much you miss her, what you miss about her........ it will help. Then find some guys, and go play basketball, or video games....... anything to take your mind off her. OTherwise, talk to her, see how she feels about you...... make sure your both on the same page, for if she is trying to push away, now would be the time to make the break, no matter how painful! good luck!

Colorless, colorless.
The "white" is caused because snow has a great many tiny interfaces, called "phase boundaries," where air (a gas phase) meets ice (a solid phase).  Every time light encounters a phase transition, it is defracted.  If you've ever looked at a stick submerged partially, you've seen this--a straight stick will look like it has a bend in it right at the water's surface.  Well, with snow, the tiny ice crystals, and the many small bubbles in ice (water is a bent and polar molecule, so when it freezes, it expands, making small bubbles inside), and the places where individual ice crystals begin and end--all of this scatters light all around.  This makes it so that a big bunch of snow will look white.  If you look at a single snowflake under a microscope, though, you will see that the crystals individally are clear.\\n\\nWhen it melts, there is only one phase transition, right at the surface.  The light is defracted a bit, but only once--it doesn't scatter light all around like snow does.\\n\\nBut it can!  If you've ever seen a big fountain, where the water is splashing and tumbling about, it will also look white due to phase transition.  Likewise, if you make a whole bunch of tiny bubbles under water, you can scatter light and make it look white.
Swimming in the pool is fine, wear the tampon. Make sure you keep the string hidden from embracing you. You will not produce enough blood to harm anyone, the chemicals will disinfect any leakage. Also remember not to take and use a white towel, use a darker colored one to help conceal and leakage when drying off.\\n\\n Special Note: when scuba diving if a lady is on her period sharks will not be drawn to them. Blood expelled is dead not what sharks sense,

No, not necessarily, however 7 years is a long time.  Have you been waiting that long or are you going to wait that long.  I think it is unfair of anyone to ask you to wait for seven years.

Depends on what you are trying to accomplish.  If quik meaningless relationships is what you want.  then trampy clothing usually is good.  but love is different, love happens on the whim.  Love is more like something you cant pinpoint.  My wife drives me crazy, and sometimes I havnt a clue why im in love with her.  then other times I dont even question it because its just there.  the presence of love Im refering too.  If a date is what your after, I would have to say confidance.  i love smart woman...so if they are smart...thats a plus.

Hi 'Error'.  I am a retired Chiropractor.  I have treated many patients with hernited discs.  Many responded to chiropractic treatment and a few did not.  Usually patients that did not respond to chiropractic care eventually improved with appropriate surgery.  \\n\\nWhat has the Chiropractor told you and your husband?  How has the herniated disc been diagnosed - MRI? CT?  What level of the spine is involved?  How large is the herniation?  Are there any additional spinal conditions that might worsen the problem (e.g. spinal canal stenosis or lateral recess stenosis)?  These types of issues help predict treatment success and/or the need for surgery.\\n\\nWhat are your husband's symtoms?  Back pain only?  Leg Pain?  Leg pain only?  Are there any signs of neurologic damage?  Change in reflexes?  Muscle weakness?  Muscle atrophy (wasting)?  Again, these issues help predict likelyhood of treatment success.\\n\\nLastly, if treatment is likely to help, some improvement should be seen within 3-4 weeks. Of course, if there is improvement, continuing treatment to maximum improvement can take many months.  However, ongoing treatment without any significant improvement, month after month, with the hopes that 'in time' it will help, is not realistic.\\n\\nOops, one more point, if chiropractic treatment is unsuccessful for your husband, referral for a neurological consult should be the next step.  At that point you want to see a Neurologist and NOT a surgeon.  Neurologists specialize in DIAGNOSIS.  They will not be motivated by 'surgical dollars' to prescribe surgery.  While a surgeon would perform the surgery (note: spinal surgery should only be performed by a neurosurgeon - someone who specializes in spinal surgery), sadly, some surgeons never see a patient (with good insurance, of course) that doesn't need surgery.\\n\\nGood luck with Chiropractic.  It often works wonders.  But if surgery is needed, be sure to find the best.\\n\\nP.S. If you want to answer the questions I have listed here, I will check back and give your further feedback.

Hernias are outpouching of the intestinal wall through the muscular layer of the abdomen.  Hernias can occur in many areas of the abdomen, and can be harmless or very serious.  When hernias become strangulated (trapped bewteen the muscular wall and blood supply is cut off) then the bowel can lose its blood supply and die... this condition requires immediate surgery.  Minor hernias are usually more of a cosmetic thing and do not cause much serious problems (unless they strangulate) but if you ever have to have surgery on your stomach (gall bladder, appendix, etc) then you should have it fixed at the same time.
That you have a definite problem that you should have checked out by a doctor. Be sure to clean the area first and see if it stops - if it continues to bleed, seek immediate medical attention.

Preparing a body for the afterlife in ancient egypt was a very long and complicated process.  The Egyptians believed that preserving the body in death was important to keep their soul alive.  The Embalmers were priests who were trained in the mummification process.  Mummification was a ritual, so the priests who participated were trained to perform the process with both surgical and ritual precision.  The embalmers were required to work and labor outside of the town in a workshop called a “Wabet” or a clean place.\\n\\nThe head priest that supervised the ritual wore a terra-cotta mask in the form of Anubis.  Anubis was the chosen god for surgeons, and for priests performing the mummification process.  By wearing the mask of Anubis it symbolized Anubis watching over the mummification process to guide the priests in the ritual.  It was important that the priest did not make any unnecessary cuts in the body, because if the spirit could not recognize the body it would be doomed to wonder across the Earth and possibly haunt the priest responsible.\\n\\nThe first step in the process was to make a cut in the abdomen, below the ribs, on the left side of the body.  This first incision was done with a special flint knife, and all other cutting was done with an ordinary metal blade.  They had to cut into the body so that they could take out special organs.  Once the organs were removed they were placed in canopic jars, which were carved out of alabaster and inscribed with spells that would one day enable the organs to rejoin the body when it was resurrected.  The organs that were placed in the jars include: stomach, lungs, intestines, and liver.  Once inside the canopic jars each organ was protected by the one of sons of Horus whose head graced the lid.\\n\\nNext the brain would be extracted through the nose and then thrown away.  Resin was then poured through the nose and into the skull with the use of a funnel, to keep the head from collapsing.  The heart was left in place because later in the underworld Anubis would weigh the heart and guide the soul through the underworld.  During the embalming process every part of the body was saved and either placed in the tomb with the body or given to the relatives of the deceased.  Then, the body and organs were preserved with spices and dried out with natron salt.  The spices that were used in the preservation process made the body look brown and leathery.\\n\\nThe entire preservation process took about 70 days.  After the process was complete, the body was wrapped in linen.  Death masks were placed on the head of the mummy around the bandages to be used as a replacement head incase something happened to the real skull. Special amulets were placed within the wrapping of the mummy to protect it.  Finally, a “mummy tag,” similar to our toe tags, was placed around the mummy’s neck to help identify it for burial.

Rim fire and center fire refer to the location on the cartridge where the priming compound is located.  In rim fire shells such as the .22 rim fire, the priming compound is located in the rim of the base of the shell.  The gun which is chambered for these shells have a firing pin which strikes the rim of the shell thereby igniting the priming compound.  With center fire shells, the priming compound is located in a primer which is pressed into the center of the base of shell.  Guns chambered for center fire cartridges have the firing pin located so that it strikes the primer located in the center of the base of the shell.  Most cartridges are of the center fire type.

I believe that each one of us contains the Divine seed within. I just know that God incarnates on Earth many times whether as well-known incarnations such as: Jesus, Buddha, Satya Sai Baba, Krishna, etc. or as someone unknown working quietly. I view them as fully grown Divine trees that continue to give fruit and help nurture our "seeds" within so that we may grow to be the beautiful trees that they all are.\\n\\nI believe that it takes several lifetimes to continue to grow. We pick up where we left off spiritually in the previous life. I am sure I've had several lives in different religions because I feel a sense of familiarity with many religions and don't see one as better than another, just a different perspective of the path towards God.\\n\\nSince I view religion like a map that we hold in our hands, but the map itself does not take you to where you want to go. You have to do the actual action to get yourself to the destination. And those actions are the divine qualities that you need to develop in order to get to the destination of God: love, wisdom, acceptance, tolerance, nonjudgment, peace, joy, humility and so on.\\n\\nAlso I believe that if one had spent their previous life studying spirituality seriously, then the next life, one would probably not need the map/religion in order to get to Self-Realization. It just becomes much more natural and spontaneous for them because they are just "remembering" what they had learnt previously.\\n\\nI believe in what Jesus teaches. I love his parables. I also believe in what Buddha teaches. I also believe in what all of the Hindu Gods and Goddess teach. These all are Divine teachers. They all have a lot of similiarities. They all teach me who to become within in order to be closer to God, that seed within. They all teach me what it really means to be loving, compassionate, wise, accepting and nonjudgmental.\\n\\nI just believe that everybody can teach me something about myself whether big or small. Even people who do the opposite can still teach me how to NOT be that way.
There are four things that make English Germanic.\\n\\n1)  It's sound system is clearly derived from Proto-Germanic through regular sound changes.  For example, English hound, German Hund (h:h, n:n, d:t); English tide, German Zeit (t:ts; d:t); etc.\\n\\n2)  It's basic vocabulary is clearly Germanic.  For example, (English/German) come/kommen; foot/fuss; five/fünf; etc.\\n\\n3)  It's grammar is clearly Germanic.  For example, Early Modern English come/comest/cometh, German komme/kommst/kommt; English "i have made", German "ich habe gemacht" (same perfect construction)\\n\\n4)  It's irregularities are the same irregularities found in the other Germanic languages.  For example, English bind/bound, German binden/bund (strong verbs); English man/men, German Mann/Männer (vowel change for plural)\\n\\nEnglish is absolutely, 100% a Germanic language through regular sound correspondences, the majority of its basic vocabulary, the majority of its grammatical structures, and the same patterns of irregularity

Women who are atrracted to women. It comes from greek. A young lady teacher (dont remmember her name) would right poems about her girl students.

I am in a very similar situation with a guy. We have never talked before, but we are constantly making eye contact every day at each other. It's like, whenever I look over at him, he is looking at me. You cant really tell if a girl LIKES you if you have never talked, but you can tell if a girl is attracted to you. There is a difference. If you catch her looking at you, then quickly turning away or acting shy around you, its a good sign that she is attracted to you.
I generally do vote for another party. The Libertarian Party is the most viable 3rd party alternative. I think that most Republicans and most Democrats are just as evil as each other, maybe just in different ways, so it makes no difference to me which one is in office. To those who say I am wasting my vote I say that at least I am voting for someone I can believe in, not for a lesser of 2 evils. If more people voted for who they really wanted, we'd be better off, even if it is just sending a message to the powers that otherwise be.

1 Let me be very clear it was not a penalty, but that is not a fault of the italians. italians , spanish, french all these players have always had the tendency to go for penalties, its their game like it or not. why blame them only ? anyone remember Rivaldo against Turkey in 2002 group league, he faked to get a penalty. Brazilians do it too !!! It was the refs fault why blame italy ?\\n\\n2 Aussies played very very well, but they have to accept the fact that their finishing was pooor , & they created very little despite having a man advantage. They never looked like scoring & winning the match. On the contrary Italy had better openings.\\n\\n3 Ref was poor , but again Materazzi's red card was harsh, 11 against 11 would have been a different game.\\n\\n\\n4 Italy did defend very well, give them credit for that. \\n\\n\\n5  I agree there has been a mess in Serie A but you can never undermine the quality, Italian clubs have won European competitions more than any other country , check the records.\\nItaly hve won 3 WCs, they are the first & only european country to win back to back WC. Also they have the 3rd best record in WC next to brazil & germany, better than Argentina or England, you have to accept that they are good.\\n\\nSome people say they have little sucess in recent times well check this\\n1978-  4th\\n1982- champs\\n1986 - quarter finals\\n1990 - 3rd\\n1994 - 2nd\\n1998 - quarter finals\\n2002 - 2nd round\\nthey have not last a WC knockout match in normal time since 1986, and have reached semifinals in 4 of last 7 WCs, they have played 16 Wcs which is 2nd to Brazil.

Just because the two of you have broken things off, doesn't mean that your feelings will automatically shut off the moment things end. As long as you are honest with yourself then you can deal with your feelings, if you know there's no chance of getting back together then take some time out for you and then move on to someone else because time does heal all wounds, and when you meet someone else you can create new memories. Good luck

I try to have coffee or tea with sweeteners. That fills me up a bit and gets rid of the sweet craving. In fact i do this throughout the day if i need it. You think you need sugar, but the sweet flavour of the drink fools your mind.\\n\\nIf you are really desperate, then try 3 sweeteners. You can buy them in powder (great for cereals!!) or tablets (great for taking with you)
Hi Red Rock\\n\\nHere are some ideas on how to heal the issue.\\n\\nCauses\\nWarts are caused by any of 35 viruses and are often a consequence of poor diet and nutrition, poor hygiene, and, in the cases of genital warts, unprotected sex. Warts also become more common as a consequence of aging with corresponding diminished immune function.\\n\\nCaution: Some warts can turn into cancerous tumors. If they do not seem benign, consult with a physician immediately.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------...\\n\\nNatural Cures\\n\\nNote: Natural healing of warts may require one to two months of care, with the wart disappearing suddenly in one to three days.\\n\\nAromatherapy: Lemon essential oil applied topically can speed healing. Thuja oil is also effective for dealing with warts.\\n\\nDiet: Eat an organic, whole foods diet, emphasizing foods that are high in vitamin A, such as dark green and yellow vegetables, cold-water fish, eggs, and sulfur, such as onions, garlic, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and broccoli. Avoid all refined and processed foods, sugar, unhealthy fats, and excess animal proteins, as well as milk and dairy products.\\n\\nHerbs: a.Onions for Warts: Warts have been said to disappear when treated perseveringly with raw onion dipped in salt. \\n\\nb.Wild Lettuce for Warts: The expressed juice is "much regarded as an application to boils, abscesses and carbuncles, and if put upon warts will cause them to drop off. \\n\\nc.Garlic for Warts and Moles: Here is a very successful routine for removal of these unwanted growths called moles, or warts. Take a button of garlic, slice or cut in two, and placed the cup area over a wart of mole. Tape it on, and as it dries out put a fresh piece. Many users have reported good results. \\n\\nd.Cashew Oil: The cashew oil, which must be used with great caution, is used as an application to warts, corns, ringworms, cancerous ulcers. \\n\\nd.Potassium Deficiency for Warts and Moles: When cysts or tumors grow in places where they can be seen outside the body, often we react by having them cut out. This defeats healing by working on the effect instead of the cause. You can cut cysts out, tumors off, and burn warts off (which are also a potassium deficiency), or get rid of as many moles as you wish, but unless you go to the cause, they will grow back again, and you may end up with as many or more cysts, tumors, moles as before. Different signs of potassium deficiency will keep popping out on the body because the condition that needs correcting is on the inside. You have to go into the cause, Dr. Christopher always insisted, which is the way we have been eating.Potassium sources: There are several ways to receive your potassium. Dr. Bernard Jensen sells a potassium broth made from dehydrated vegetables. Dr. Bronner makes a similar, excellent product. You can also make your own potassium broth by simmering equal parts of red potatoes, celery, carrots, onions, and herbs to taste. Raw vegetable and fruit juices also flood the system with potassium. \\n\\nBest of health to you

First you must understand the notation that is being used to represent the chord.  The Bsus2 is the chord while the /B indicates the inversion that is being played (The note that is the lowest). Since the lowest note being played is the root then the chord is in its first inversion. That means that the /B part is redundant and not necessary. The author of the tab should not have notated the chord this way because it is confusing. Since the /B part is not necessary you should play a regular Bsus2 chord.\\n\\nFor more information visit (found via Google):\\nhttp://www.all-guitar-chords.com/

I have recently heard about savings secured loans, which use your savings account as collateral.  It is one of the best deals around, because at the end of the loan period, you still have savings.  It works like this:  you pay a particular amount to the bank (usually a credit union), say 5% for the loan; in the meantime, you earn interest on your savings account, say 2.5%.  When you pay off the bank, your savings is freed up, and you have really only paid 2.5% interest for the loan.  The only drawback I can foresee is if you don't have any savings to begin with.

By bilingual education, I am going to assume that you mean teaching children in their native language and the language of a country they have immigrated to.\\n\\n1) The children aren't pushed to immerse themselves in the new language they need to learn, instead being taught that a mix of their native language and the new language \\n2) It is far easier for teachers to lapse back into the children's native language when they get tired of trying to explain a concept in the new language thus defeating the goal of teaching them the new language.

As I am sure you can appreicate, Northern China is a pretty big area, so if you don't mind I've centred on the city of Harbin (neat the border with Mongolia). Well, the first thing is "swings and roundabouts" and perhaps a place that should bid for a future Summer and Winter Olympics in the same year. In January, the average temperature is -26°C (in other words, frigid) and in July it can get as hot at 29°C leading to an annual range of 55°C and as for rainfall, well, it gets a good soaking in the summer but in the winter it's as dry as a desert.

If you're going on with a masters afterwards anyway, then I'd say the Engineering will serve you better at the undergrad level, regardless of which direction you choose.\\n\\nI'm just finishing my Ph.D. in Economics.  When I was applying to grad schools, I was shocked to learn that the Econ grad programs actually give preference to undergrads with Engineering or Math majors OVER Economics majors.  The reason for that is because grad programs in Economics today are heavily math-intensive, and they have observed that Engineering and Math undergrads tend to do better in the Econ programs.\\n\\nSo, regardless of what you decide to do later, the Engineering major will be better for you.  If you want to keep all your options open, do an Econ minor along with it.  That way, you've got another 3 1/2 years to decide which route you want to take.  \\n\\nGood luck!

This is a BIG question.  About 50% of all AIDS patients in North America are homosexuals or bisexuals.  \\n\\nNaturally, you can do the math to see that a gay person has much higher odds.  However, this disease first moved through the gay community and later to the straight.  So, the number of AIDS patients is not the same data as the number currently getting infected.\\n\\nTo further complicate things, these stats are drastically different from country to country.\\n\\n\\nBottom line:  \\n\\n1.  Anal sex if physically more vulnerable to HIV contraction than vaginal.\\n\\n2.  Permiscuity is a major factor, obviously.  Gay or striaght, be careful who you sleep with.\\n\\n3.

Gotta love wiki\\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin\\n\\nChromatin is DNA + proteins that are involved in the condensation of DNA (making DNA take less space).

First, the oil companies are making around 10% margins on gas.  See Exxon's income statement here: http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=XOM&annual\\n\\nSo, if the government decided to chop off some of that last 10%, you might get back some of that.  Most people aren't going to be happy with just a few cents, though.\\n\\nFrom basic economics, if you impose a price ceiling, supply drops: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_ceiling\\n\\nFirms try to maximize their profits, so they'll be willing to produce less at a lower price.  If you lower it so that each gallon of gas is giving them negative profit (P < AVC), they'll just stop producing gas completely because it's dumb to keep on losing more and more money unless you're MSFT selling Xboxes trying to get market share.\\n\\nThey could also just sell it elsewhere and start exporting, where they can get a better price for it.  China and India are starting to demand more oil as their economies grow.  Or even sell the crude oil (without refining it) on the futures market and drive that down a little.\\n\\nEither way, the most likely scenario of a drastic price ceiling is long gas lines, similar to what happened in the 70s.  It's arguable whether this is more or less desirable than higher gas prices.

Sorry to disappoint you mate- but it's impossible! Girls are the most unpredictable of all God's creations (trust me- I'm a girl). But, if you really want to know a girl inside out, then the best way is to become her best friend. This works especially if you're a boy, because girls tend to tell boys things they might not always tell other girls. So, listen to her, and talk to her, and get to know her, and you'll start to get a rough idea of what's on her mind. Also, pay attention to her body language, and expressions. It works sometimes! But be warned, no two girls are alike, and sometimes, even the girl doesn't really know how she feels, and when she does, she probably won't tell you... It's an art that takes time and practice... You could just ask her what's on her mind, I suppose!

She would need to apply for a spouse visa, which would be valid for two years. At the end of that time, if you are still together and she hasn't needed any form of public assistance (benefits, council housing, etc) then she should get settlement here.\\n\\nIf your beloved is legally resident in Canada, and you can show that you can accommodate her, etc, you'll probably be OK. If she's there illegally, you may have problems! If she's there on a temporary basis, they'll treat her as if she's applying from Russia, ie skeptically, I should think.\\n\\nAnyway, I think she could apply at the British High Commission in Canada, she'll probably be called there for an interview, where they'll look at her documentation, and question her about the nature of her relationship with you.\\n\\nLook, I'm not an immigration advisor, so check out the Home Office website www.homeoffice.gov.uk, and get some free advice from somewhere like a CAB or Law Centre - it's really important not to get these things wrong, and the law is changing all the time.\\n\\nBy the way, if she comes here on some other visa, eg tourist visa, she will NOT be allowed to marry you here. So check it all out first.\\n\\nGood luck!

Jumping Rope\\nWorkout Suggestions- change workouts to include jumping with both feet, one foot, and alternating feet. Jump rope 2-4 times per week. Alternate between the following two workouts: \\n\\n1) Quick Bursts- 30-45 second intervals at the fastest tempo possible without breaking your rhythm, with 1 minute rests between each repetition. Try 3 sets of 3 reps. with a 2 minute rest between each set. \\n\\n2) Endurance- Jump 20 minutes at a moderated pace, alternating your foot patterns throughout the workout. Set goals of 5, 10, 15, or 20 minutes without a "miss". Jump with a walkman on, listening to your stereo, or while watching TV. \\n\\n\\nMuscles Worked- Primary: wrists, ankles, calves. Secondary: shoulders. SOFT FEET. \\n\\nInline Skating\\nYour primary objective should be to reinforce correct skating techniques. Anytime you are in skates, hockey or inline, correct skating motions should be executed. This will develop good habits, not bad ones. Assuming you do this, enjoy a nice sunny day on your blades and remember to ALWAYS wear a helmet and sufficient protective equipment. \\n\\nWorkout Suggestions- Vary your workouts to include distance training and technical skills training. Train on your inline skates 2-3 times per week. To avoid dehydration and sun burn, skate in the morning or evening and drink plenty of fluids. Select a safe, newly paved surface. \\n\\n1) Distance Training- skate a 50% speed for 20-30 minutes maintaining a 90 degree kneebend. Try to find a route with changing scenery. \\n\\n2) Technical Skills Training- Work on your skating and puck control skills for 30-45 minutes. Create drills to develop your forward and backward strides, crossunders, turns, stickhandling, passing, and shooting. This is a mental workout, rather than a physical workout. The emphasis is on precise execution, not power or speed. Skills must be practiced at a learnable rate. Again, for technical skills training ideas and effective drills, call 1-800-320-7545 for our latest hockey skills training video. \\n\\nMuscles Worked- Quadriceps, hamstrings, cardiovascular. \\n\\nSlideBoard Training\\nA training tool widely used by international speedskaters and competitive hockey players to develop leg strength, correct striding, and to provide a challenging cardiovascular workout. \\n\\nWorkout Suggestions- Vary your workouts to include distance training, quick burst training, and technical skills training. Incorporate slide board workouts 2-3 times per week. \\n\\n1) Distance Training- stroke a 50% thrust for 20-30 minutes maintaining a 90 degree kneebend and a consistent head level. Swing your arms back and forth to involve your upper body and to finish the transfer of body weight. Adjust the slide board to a challenging length. \\n\\n2) Quick Burst Training- Adjust the board to a shorter length. Maintain controlled strides, pick up the tempo of your strides to approximately twice that of your distance training. Three sets of three 30 -45 second bursts at 80-90%. Rest 1 minute between reps and 2 minutes between sets. \\n\\n3) Technical Skills Training- Complete, explosive leg thrust and upper body control must be maintained throughout any workout involving striding motions. \\n\\n\\nMuscles Worked- Quadriceps, hamstrings, cardiovascular. \\n\\n\\nRunning Steps/Stairs\\nThis could very well be one of the best cross-training activities, one that simulates game-like situations, challenges you mentally and physically, and allows you to breathe fresh outside air on a nice summer day. Step training will develop explosive leg strength and quick burst speed. \\n\\nWorkout Suggestions- Go to your local high school or stadium and run 2-4 sets of 3 reps, 1-2 times per week. Each repetition should involve a 20-30 second burst up the steps, with 45 second rest intervals between each rep. Concentrate on exploding off deep kneebend, swinging arms front to back, and maintaining a level head position. Change your step workouts to include running every other step, or using only

A fringe shift is most often referred to in interferometry experiments such as the Michelson-Morley. It is the behavior of a pattern of "fringes" when the phase relationship between the component sources change.\\n\\nA fringe pattern can be created in a number of ways but the stable fringe pattern found in the Michelson type interferometers is caused by the separation of the original source into two separate beams and then recombining them at differing angles of incidence on a viewing surface.

Not sure what you're asking here - 2% incline means that the height you go up is 2% of the horizontal distance (not the slope distance) travelled.\\n\\nSo 2% will mean for every 100m horizontal you travel - you will go up 2m.\\n\\nSo are you saying you have travelled 1 mile horizontally - in which case you will move up 0.02 miles (or using pythagoras' theorem you could get the actual slope distance travelled d² = 1² + 0.02², which gives 1.0002 miles)\\n\\nOr are you saying you have travelled 1 mile vertically - in which case you will have moved 50 miles horizontally (since there are 50 2%'s in 100%) (or do you want the actual slope distance travelled, d² = 1² + 50², which gives 50.01 miles)\\n\\nOr are you saying you have travelled 1 mile up a 2% slope.  In which case we need to use pythagoras' theorem backwards to get the horizontal and vertical parts.  The horizontal we can call x and the vertical is 2% of this, ie 0.02x.\\n\\nSo we get:  1² = x² + (0.02x)²\\n\\n1 = x² + 0.0004x²\\n1 = 1.0004x²\\nx² = 1/1.0004 - 0.99960\\nx = 0.9998\\n\\nSo we will have travelled 0.998 miles horizontally and 2% of this (which is 0.019996 miles) vertically.

Most people would probably relate this to physics, but I deal more with the electromagnetism of paranormal activities. I have seen watches stop. The freakiest one was on a camping trip, we felt a spirit near the bon-fire. We had a ring of 40 tiki-torches around the bonfire. It was a still and windless night, but all the tiki flames near the spirit bent in. One of the people in the circle had a fancy camera. After the campout she went to get the film developed, and all the photos from before the visitor turned out, but after that all the film was blank. She took the camera in to be repaired.

You see the canteloupe is one of the shyest melons because it has a lot to live up to being the one of the more common ones. I have found that if you spend several hours telling the melon that it is big enough and strong enoung and gosh darn it people like it, it does rather well. Now musk and honeydew are a little trickier. The tactic that has yielded the largest size in these varieties for me has been to play them against each other. I plant little seeds of jealousy like telling the honeydew that "You know why Aunt Betty always used musk melon in her 4th of July salads dont you? Its because it was bigger than you honey, its not that it tastes better its just that you havent given it your all." With the musk usually a comment about its name works, something like, "Come on lets get real, just listen to your name, musk. If you had to choose between a melon named musk or honey which one would you choose?.....honey of course. I conotates a more delicious experience in every way. The only way you'll ever get picked is if you dazzle them with your size so get busy and get big" Using this stratagey has yielded melons the size of a bowling ball. Who else loves to watch pro-bowling isnt it amazing to watch? Theres just something about those people gently scooping up those shining beauties wiping them down with the same wrag that they use on thier own sweat as the precurser to the big show, that shiny spinning beautiful warrior gracefully on its journey to meet its battle with the 10 evil white advancing monguls. Before you know it *BLAM-O* the battle is over and we see just how well our little warrior did. Ahhh, oops... I guess I got a little off track, sorry. Anyways,... as far as the sweating part it all depends on where your melon farm is located. I have had many farms in many locales. Raising melons in the heat of the Saharah can make one lose a little moisture on the brow but nothing like the Venus Vines farm I had in the 70's, I can remember bursting into flames on a few occasions. MMMM MMMM MMMM MMM MMM Toasty! Those are all problems that I solved with gallons of gatoraid mixed with pickle juice and a hat with a little teany tiny fan that I bought off and info-mercial for 5 easy payments of $19.95. Plus working in the nude helps from time to time, just remember to where your sun screen. Hope this helped. J

YOU NEED TO BE UP FRONT WITH HIM AND ASK WHATS GOING ON. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU WANTING TO NOT PLAY GAMES WITH HIM.

Yes...if a player is injured during his at bat (ie: fouling a ball off of his body resulting in broken bones or getting a major muscle strain where he just can't swing/stand the pain)  It happened to Jermaine Dye when he was with Oakland.  They were playing the Yankees at Yankee Stadium and he fouled a ball off of his leg and shattered the bone below the knee.  Dye was carried off of the field by 2 players.  The batter who replaced him inherited his count.  I think it may have been a playoff game and El Duque was pitching (not positive about this).

Get out the yellow pages and call companies in your field and ask if you can fax over your resume and to who's attention. You can follow up in a week with a call to that person. Take a look at your resume. Is it full of gobbledegook about you are looking for a meaningful job or discusses your character instead of what work you can do? Employers want to see a specific job objective like to find a sales trainee position where I can use my strong interpersonal skills. Stuff about finding a meaningful job goes in the garbage esp if you can't say what kind of job you are looking for. You should also be telling everyone you knows including relatives that you are looking for a job. Also apply for civil service jobs and look on the websites of the school systems
Yes you can.  Download Netstumbler and Ethereal (both free) and give those a try.  Ethereal is a freeware Sniffer, and depending on your wireless network card's internal chipset, you may or may not be able to sniff the lower level wireless frames, which would have MAC addresses, SSIDs, and everything else too.  But try NetStumbler first, it works great, and it will detect all other wireless LANs in your proximity and tell you what channel they're on (so you can detect if a neighbor is interfering with you) and if they have security turned on, etc.  Say for example you see your neighbor on channel 6 (common default) and their signal strength is good, then you can change your AP to channels 1 or 11 to minimize interference.

If it's actually an option offerred by the school, then do it if it's financially practical and YOU are comfortable with it.  Why are you worrying about whether someone else thinks it's "lame"?  That's *their* problem.  Besides, do a little more research - if the school is offerring the option, it's most likely in a dorm or on a floor designated for married couples - so you wouldn't be alone.
Most "heart patient's" sleep with their feet elevated.  LOL.   I have a bad heart.  I sleep anyway I want.  I've had stints.  Doesn't matter if you sleep on the right or left.  What you want is to allow the heart to pump blood with least resistance.  Heart patient's have problems with their legs swelling.  Of course you want to make sure their breathing is not obstructed, this is best done on their back with legs eleveate and soft pillow just under shoulder and head for comfort.  Nice if the bed is adjustable and you can keep the legs above the heart.

A good argument can be made that google is relevant to all five environments but you have to decide which of the environments are relevant to the article.  \\n\\nFor instance, if the article is about competition then google is certainly relevant because it gets about 48% of all searches done on the Internet.  This is the highest share so google is beating the competition.

Because these people on here have no idea what they are talking about.  they dont see or care that the mexicans are NOT taking jobs but doing jobs lazy proudful Americans dont want.  Illegals are here because Immigration laws are ridiculous.  People who are poor and desprete to feed their kids cant afford the high cost, or the time it takes to come here to legal way, is this their fault?  NOOO Its the systems fault.  If your kid was starving you had no money, would you not steal to feed them?  Same thing for the illegals people.  YES to immigration reform, make a way to HELP these people get what they need to work here, But you fools need to get INFORMED.  Mexicans ADD to this country weather you like it or not we NEED them.\\n\\nAll of you who complain and open your big mouths about stuff you know nothing about are the fist to be signed up for cotton duty when the illegals leave.  18 cents a bushal, 16 hour days, 7 days a week.  you want them gone?  Ok then you take their jobs!!  Any takers....I bet not so shut up.\\n\\nIllegals are NOT eligabile for welfare so stop all the lying.  Without a social security card they are denighed, fack papers took, and they are charged with fraud.\\n\\n**Illegals DO pay taxes UNLESS they are paid in cash.  You forget some Americans too avoid taxes by being paid in cash, but I see no complaints to that...Illegals who are paid by check pay taxes they just dont get a return....GET INFORMED your comments are false.\\n\\nP.S.  It is obvious by the lack of intelligance here, that most posters are just wanting something to argue about and not really intrested in the facts.
It's a scam\\n\\n///
My gosh, I SO know what you mean!!  You are completely entitled to your opinion.  I'm going to share something with you.  I worked with a girl for a long time whom I just despised because she did the same thing.  I'd buy a certain type of shirt, the next day, she had one, I'd buy knee high boots, the following week she'd have brand new knee high boots, I'd bought a Honda, she bought a Honda,  this went on for 7 years.  The last year we worked together, her husband left her for the third time and she befriended me.  I was much wiser than her so I helped her (even though part of me despised her, I tried very hard to look beyond it).   In that time, I realized how screwed up her whole life had been even though she excelled a lot at work and was a very dominant figure-at work.  At home, however, she was a coward who had no identity of her own because her mother had been so controlling.   I put all the pieces of the puzzle together and realized that in copying me in everything, she was jealous of the fact that I was grounded and centered and she wasn't.  She essentially was copying to try and find her own identity but couldn't.  I was finally able to pity her as opposed to hating her and having to waste time and money in a therapist's office talking about it!!\\n\\nMy point is that you are totally centered and grounded.  It is more than evident in your question and the way you ask it.  You have your (*&^ together.   They are completely lame for doing what they're doing and yes, they are classless.  Totally classless.  That is pretty much as low as you can go.  \\n\\nAnd with it being your B-I-L, it's not like you can avoid them knowing because obviously your husband tells them.  So I guess the only thing you can do is understand why (and that's why this comment is so long-sorry).  And hopefully that will help you.   Just know that people that do that are followers, not leaders.   you are a leader, they are followers who know not where they're going.  How sad.  \\n\\nEven though that girl excelled at work more than I did because I didn't have it in me to backstab, suck up to the point of no dignity and what have you, I realized that my personal life was going to reward me so much more than work and that was all she had was work.   All your b-i-l has is a directionless life with a wife who has no identity of her own.  Can you just imagine what that thought process is like?  It's not much!!!!   Imagine what it's like to live your life with absolutely NO passion?   You on the other hand have tons of passion, I can see it in your question!!!  You're full of passion.  So rest in comfort knowing that he and she are passionless people walking around looking for how they should exist.  Looking for a way to fit in.  \\n\\nFollowers never really lead.  They always follow.
This is tough, but you are obviously dealing with an HR staff that doesn't have enough faith in their company.\\n\\nSalary ranges are one of those areas where you only see what YOU want.  For example.  If HR says the job pays from $35-$40k a year.  They want to hire you at $35k.  But if you say, my range is $35-$40k, you really want $40k.  It is just natural human perception.\\n\\nEven though your attitude is correct, salary negotiations should not be discussed until the point the company wants to hire you, you are stuck in this one.  If you don't put the range on, HR will can your resume because you didn't follow a simple direction.  They have asked for this because they have found that what the company thinks the skills are worth, and what people that hold the skills think their worth, are two very different things.\\n\\nYou have no choice, but you can beat them at their own game.   Just keep it very vague, something like:\\n\\nRequested Salary Range:  Mid $40's \\n\\nJust don't be tempted to lowball your requirements to get the interview.  If you do, your offer will never be what you want, it will be what you stated.\\n\\nGood luck
Sure do.If you think about it,NOBODY could possibly know how someone feels.

During that time there was two complementary beliefs that were almost universally accepted until the work of Galileo and the like.\\n\\n1. That peoples lives were affected by and tied up in the heavenly realms. So, belief in astrology was very deeply entrenched. For example, there was a royal astrologer in most courts in those days, including the court of Elizabeth 1. Despite the prevailing Christian views of the time, people were still given to the stars.\\n\\n2. As is clear in writing of the time, including the plays of Shakespeare, many believed that human events, especially those on a catastrophic scale or involveing kings and princes, caused effects on the earthe and the skies. So, as in Shakespeare's Macbeth, the murder of a king would create storms and upheaval.\\n\\nThe irony is that indeed the deeds of man, environmentally, have affected the weather and created ununual events. maybe the Elizabethans were right after all.
I did a lot of research to prepare this answer.  I scoured the Internet for more data, and reviewed many issues of both the New Yorker and the Los Angles Times for more background information.  When Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was a young boy living in his native land, he was thirsty for knowledge and learning.  There were few books in the desert, and those that were available were written in English, a language the youngster could not comprehend.  He slowly learned to read and speak English, mostly self-taught.  One day, as legend would have it, he discovered a box of books that were tattered and torn, all with wonderful animation and written by the same author.  He read the books, carefully, and at first glance did not appreciate the dry wit.  After learning more of the nuances of the English language, he began to find the books mildly amusing, then later, uproariously hilarious.  The books were all written by an American infidel named Charles Schultz.  Abu Musab al-Zarqawi found the most interesting character to be Pig Pen.  He could identify with the constant dust swirling around the young lad, and felt a kinship to him.  He started to write long, flowing letters to Charles Shultz, all of them with the same theme.  He wanted to know about the Pig Pen character.  He also requested that Charles Shultz change the name of Pig Pen to “Infidel Pig Pen”, but none of his letters were ever answered.  Later, to his horror, he found out that Pig Pen was based on a real human being, Rory Emerald.  He discovered this one day, while reading the New Yorker.  He was most outraged when he found out that Rory Emerald had violated Charles Schultz’s pet animals, and even had “relations” with a disgusting swine.  \\n\\nIt appears that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was not obsessed with destroying America or Americans.  His obsession was more in the destruction of Rory Emerald, the noted celebrity, who has residences in both New York City and Los Angeles.  When he learned of Mr. Emerald’s bedding down with swine, it so enraged Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, that his vision became blurred.  His mantra became “the infidel must die!”  As a known terrorist, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi had many weapons at his disposal.  Fortunately, his timely death ended the threat to Rory Emerald’s life.  At Abu Musab al-Zarqawi’s funeral, Rory Emerald was quoted as saying “It is a sad day in mankind, when we cheer and applaud the death of another human being”, while tears slowly cascaded down his cheeks.  \\n\\nPersonally, I am glad he is dead, but in keeping spirit with Rory Emerald’s sage words, I will not applaud too loudly.  His words brought tears to my eyes.

What happens is that bacteria, which the antibiotics attack, become immune to the antibiotics. Over-prescribing anti-biotics is bad because it causes bacteria to develop resistance. This is why in the past very small quantities of penicillin-type drugs were necessary to treat a bacterial infection, whereas the dosages are now 100s of times greater. This is also why scientists are always struggling to keep up with bacteria which obtain resistance quickly.\\n\\nThe best strategy is to use antibiotics only when you are sure you need them. If you have a viral illness such as the flu, antibiotics are useless. Also, if you take way too many antibiotics, you risk fungal infections. The reason is because fungi and bacteria are always in competition, and when you eliminate one, the other starts to grow out of hand. Some people have had urinary tract infections from fungi because they took too many antibiotics.  Not a pretty sight. \\n\\nJust take antibiotics when you have a bacterial infection. If you don't know the origin of your infection (if it is bacterial or viral), your doctor may initially prescribe antibiotics until he can confirm the origin of the infection in lab work.

Congratulations on your promotion! \\n\\nYour goal is to motivate your employees to accomplish the goals of the organization.\\n\\nBe supportive and encouraging of your employees. You are the team leader and make sure that you show them that you are willing and able to help them, especially when it's busy. Always remember what it's like to be an entry level employee so you don't forget what motivated you.\\n\\nEncourage your employees to do their best. When they screw up, don't yell! Instead, calmly talk to them and help them to learn how to stop making the mistakes. \\n\\nRemember that in training it's not just explaining it, but ensuring that the employee UNDERSTANDS what to do. People learn best by doing, rather than just being told. So show them and carefully explain, then watch them to make sure they understand.\\n\\nPraise the good work they do. Recognize the people when they do something to take care of the customer. Commend an employee when they go out of their way to gain customer satisfaction.\\n\\nDo NOT belittle an employee, and don't gossip. As a fast food manager, you want the employees to work together as a team. \\n\\nEach day, try to remember something the employees did well and commend them for doing that.\\n\\nBe approachable to the employees and you will build their trust.\\n\\nThe best supervisor I ever had would come up and tell me that he  appreciated my work and was glad that I was working for him. Then he would ask me how I liked my job and there was anything he could do to make my job easier or if I was having problems with anything. You know what, he had the employees going out of their way to make sure he was happy.\\n\\nDon't hide information from them. It ticks me off when I'm told to do something but not given information WHY I'm doing something. \\n\\nCredibility is important. Walk the walk. Maintain integrity with them. If you promise them something, deliver onthat promise or explain to them why you cannot deliver what you promised.\\n\\nThere will be those problem employees that are not motivated to work - they are there only for a paycheck or to socialize with their friends. I'd recommend doing a search on motivational strategies. \\n\\nGood luck to you! If you are asking questions like this, it sounds like you are definitely trying to make a good impression. And you know what? A person who makes an effort deserves the benefit of the doubt. Just remember to stay focused on your goals. If you keep a positive, can do attitude, you will do very well.\\n\\nCongratulations and best wishes on your future!

Alzheimer's Disease is a FORM of dementia. There are other types.  It's a physical deterioration of the brain--the neurons are in "tangles" and covered with "plaque" (those are the scientific words) which is a geometrical progression downhill--as more neurons die and become tangles, the surrounding neurons can't communicate with any other ones, and they die too.\\nIt is not DIRECTLY fatal like cancer is.  What happens is, as the person's brain deteriorates, that person forgets how to do more and more essential functions. Eventually AD patients forget how to eat and starve or choke or aspirate their food into their lungs (causing infection and death), or they forget to breathe and just die.  In the earlier stages a person can die through carelessness--forgetting to look both ways when crossing the street and getting hit by a car, or leaving a pan on the stove and burning down the house.\\nIt's an awful terrible disease. My dad has it.

According to sites in our Texas category, the name of Texas comes from the Indian words "teysha" or "tejas." These words mean either "hello friend" or "friendly" -- which makes sense, because Texans can be very friendly people! Early in Texas history, people from this area were called "Texians." Did you know that six different flags have flown over Texas in its history? First Spain, then France, Mexico, the Confederacy, and the Republic of Texas each ruled the region before Texas became part of the United States in 1845. Yee-haw!

What is meant by a balanced budget is subject to interpretation and handled differently in many states. See this chart from the National Conference of State Legislatures (which is an organization that serves state legislators across the country and compares how issues are handled differently by different states).\\n\\nhttp://www.ncsl.org/programs/fiscal/balbuda.htm\\n\\nNew York state's requirements are considered not stringent, the Governor is required to prepare a balanced budget but the legislature is not required to pass a balanced budget, and the State is permitted to carry an operating deficit across a fiscal year boundary. \\n\\nAlso note, even in states with more stringent requirements it is often unclear how a balanced budget amendment can really be enforced. And New York state politicians have been notorious for the last decade or so for passing budgets later than the deadline the state is supposed to meet.

Marriage has always been defined as the union between one man and one woman.  Homosexuals who love each other want the same status and standing as heterosexuals.  One of the chief concerns is, if we change the definition of marriage to include same sex couples, then it will also be expanded to include other unions such as:  multiple partners, adults and children, adults and animals, and whatever can be imagined by human beings.  \\n\\nIt has been suggested that same sex couples be provided the same rights that marriage allows, but it is most often stated in the media that same sex couples not only want the same rights, they want the same standing or respect.  They too want to be called "married".  \\n\\nMany heterosexual couples are troubled by this demand because they believe marriage is a sacred trust and gift from God. They believe that marriage was instituted by God in Genesis and that God will return for his spiritual Bride in Revelation 21.  Those who are opposed to homosexual marriage would state that marriage was created by God to support the family; one man, one woman and children.  They would also state that the heterosexual family is and has been the foundation of society and culture for thousands of years.  \\n\\nThere are of couse exceptions in history and even presently.  There is also currently a high divorce rate but married heterosexuals would argue that failure in marriage does not justify changing the definition of what marriage is....one man and one woman.  Society often makes moral changes without considering the consequences or justifying the decision by stating what is wrong with the present model.  Abortion started this way, with the declaration that women's lives were in danger and women were killing themselves by attempting abortions at home or in back alleys under the care of unscrupulous doctors.  Abortion has now become a form of birth control with well over one million babies aborted yearly in the U.S. alone.  \\n\\nMany heterosexual couples see the changing of marriage to include same sex couples as fallling further and further away from what is healthy for society and farther down the road toward a loss of morality and moral standards.  They do not want marriage, which they consider sacred, changed to include other unions.  They would prefer,if same sex couples are permitted to be "married"  that same sex couples be granted the same rights but not the same name.  A different name such as "union" or the invention of a completely new word.

most everything you listed, if not all, was already known to be there and marked by the UN and the seals were not broken.\\nnow the roadside mustard bombs you mentioned, were stolen from where they were stored(which the UN and the US already knew about and they were sealed) after there was nobody around guarding the place when we took over.  it is also thought that those IED's were made without the insurgents realizing what they were using as a munition...if that is true or not, who can really say, but areas where weapons are stored, especially the ones that we did want saddam to use or have, should have been secured! instead of running around looking for ones that weren't there.  guard the ones that you know about first! then go look for others.\\nbut to sum it up...that stuff wasn't "found" if anything it was/is proof that the UN inspections worked the first time, and would have worked the second time, since in all those years saddam could have very easily removed the seals and used the stuff.  christ, i hate defending that guy, but skewing facts is wrong.

If the doctor will not freeze them off ask them about a plaster treatment. I don't remember the exact name but it is like a plaster with medication in it. Also wash your feet thoroughly and make sure you dry them before putting your shoes on. I would also spray the bathtub with lysol or a bleach solution and wash the washcloth with bleach after every shower. You should also use powder to keep your feet dry; they spread when it is moist. You can also spray the inside of your shoes with Lysol and wash your socks with bleach. \\n\\nHave you talked with your doctor about checking your immune system? You really shouldn't have that many if you are in good health otherwise. Good luck!\\n\\nEDIT: Glad to hear you are a healthy person! Just try to keep the feet dry to prevent further spread. My mom said she soaked hers everynight in a peroxide, sea salt and warm water bath and hers went away.
They don't have any immunity. In fact, they're under more scrutiny than a normal person because of the position that they hold.\\n\\nAlso, a little information from you on why you feel the way you do would be helpful in figuring out exactly what you're looking for.

Ok, so you have 500 mL of methanol. A specific gravity of .792 g/mL means there are 396 grams of methanol. Concentration (molarity) is moles per liter. So those are theu nits you want. So you take 396 grams of methanol and divide it by the molecular weight (32) to get 12.375 moles. However, that is for 500 mL or .5 L. You want 1 L. So you multiply it by 2. Your answer shoudl be 24.75 moles/liter. \\n\\nHope this helps and keep up the good work.

There is no way to answer this because EVA has some assumptions in it - specifically WACC.  You will need to use an estimate for the Cost of Equity (Ke), the pre-tax cost of debt (Kd) and long run capital structure between debt and equity. Values will vary pretty significantly based on your assumptions.  Ke should be somewhere in the high-teens to low twenties and cost of debt should be bootstrapped off the benchmark government long-bond. Unfortunately, I am not sure which one should be used, but I do know that Kd should be relatively high due to high interest rates in India.

sounds like your typical 14 yr old. They get that age and know it all. This is not always a bad thing. She is rebelling. Try some reverse psychology on her. Try acting like you dont care either. Plus, when she acts like this she is getting lots of attention from everyone telling her she should do it. Have everyone stop doing this and act as if they dont care if she goes or not. Have them talk with her about other aspects of her life. This will take the focus off of this and she will be more willing to go.  good luck

I don't think that it will start as a declared war, but as a large act of terrorism, like a chemical attack on the US.  Chemicals are far easier to get and maintain than anthrax or nukes.  Iran will probably attack Israel, Israel will retaliate and the US will be forced into a war because of our alliance with Israel.  If Russia allies herself with Iran and comes to their aid we will have a major problem.

Mankind was made in the image of God.\\n1) God is Spirit, but He made mankind flesh and blood by creating something out of nothing.\\n2) The physical man has an end, but the soul of man is immortal meaning it will never die.\\n3) Man has the gift of thinking, of which animals do not. Man also has a free-will to choose right or wrong. Animals do not. Animals have instinct, mankind has reason.\\n4) Man did not have to use his conscience until after the fall in the Garden of Eden. After they sinned against God, their consciences were used to guide them.\\n5) Man is limited to the laws of the physical universe while he is still alive in the flesh. Once a man dies he will live in the realm of the spiritual and will have no limitations like he does now.\\n6) Man has freedom to make choices but he cannot change his chief end. The chief end of all mankind is to praise and glorify Jesus Christ for all eternity.

In its most general sense, virginity is characterized by a state of unimpacted purity, usually stemming from a lack of experience (for example, newcomers to game Bingo could be referred to as virgins). Traditionally, virgin is used to describe a person who has not engaged in sexual intercourse. This use is traditionally restricted to a person who has not yet engaged in vaginal intercourse, but it is sometimes used to describe someone who has not engaged in sexual activities in general. Also, someone can be referred to as an "anal virgin," being a virgin to anal sex (specifically receiving anal sex). The status of "virginity" is sometimes respected and valued in certain societies, especially in relation to views of many religions on sexual conduct before marriage. The term maiden is also sometimes used to mean a virgin, although that can also refer to an unmarried or merely young woman.\\n\\nBtw, some cultures and religions have slightly different meaning.
Excel is the spreadsheet that comes with Microsoft Office.\\n\\nA spreadsheet is, at its most basic, a grid of boxes where you can enter numbers and equations.  Each box (called a cell) has a specific address, based on the row number and the column.  The first cell is A1, the one below it is A2, and the one to the right of it is B1.  Pretty simple so far, right?\\n\\nKnowing no more than this, you can use Excel as nothing more than a convenient editor for tabular data.  In fact, this is primarily what Excel is for... except instead of just putting in tabular data it can also calculate the data for you.\\n\\nHere's an example:  I had a garage sale recently and recorded each sale in the spreadsheet. It was pretty simple.  (Actually, I'm lying to you.  It was a complex spreadsheet that tracked a lot of different things like donor, category, and sales goals, but I'm simplifying it for this answer.  It COULD have been a simple spreadsheet).  \\n\\nIn the 'A' column I listed the item that was sold.  In the B column I listed the price of the item.  A ways down the B column--say row 100--I put an equation in by typing "=sum(B1:B99)" which meant to add up all the numbers in the cells from B1 to B99.  Now I had a functional spreadsheet that automatically updated the total sold so far.  Any time I typed in a new purchase, BAM!  There was the new total.  A lot easier than adding it up on paper, no?\\n\\nThis is basically what a spreadsheet is.  It can format numbers as percentages, dollar amounts, etc.  Basic math works like "=A5+B6" or "=C12+10" and so forth--each cell's address can be treated as a variable in the equation, and you can type in literal numbers as well..  The more common equations (average, total, etc) have buttons for them on the top.  For the more advanced ones I usually recommend choosing "function" from the insert menu.\\n\\nYou'd be surprised what excel can do.  It's pretty simple on the surface, but has tremendous power beneath.  \\n\\nI hope this answered your question.  Good luck to you.

Consent is the prime distinction.

Dissociation is when an ionic substance breaks into positive and negative ions in water or some other substance and are carried throughout the solution due to dissolution.  (also known as dissolving)  The other is ionization when a covalent acid ionizes and forms a positively charged hydronium ion and and a negative ion and is also carried throughout a solution due to dissolution.  They are both processes of dissolving

A free enterprise economy is where the market forces of supply and demand determine the price of goods and services. So, if you wanted 10 pineapples and fifty other people wanted them as well, and there were 10 pineapples then the pineapples would go to the person who is willing to pay the most for them. But let's say that there are two people and you only want one pineapple and there were fifty on the market, then the pineapple's price would be determined by who was offering the pineapple for sale for the least amount of money.

George Bush illegally and unconstitutionally invaded another sovereign nation for only two resons: 1) He wanted to 'get even' with Saddam Husseing for humiliating his daddy during Desert Storm, and 2) Big Dick Cheney wants oil that oil that' swimming underneath Iraq's sands. Until he has a rock-solid, iron-clad arrangements in place, NO TROOPS WILL BE WITHDRAWN FROM IRAQ. After all, Cheney's buddies at Halliburton and Exxon-Mobil need to get richer and richer and richer.\\n\\nBush, Cheney and Rumsfeld are the most evil, corrupt, and incompetent morons ever to occupy the White House. The current U.S. Congress is the most evil, corrupt and incompetent body ever to occupy the Capitol Building.\\n\\nThese people all deserve to be impeached or tried for high treason. If convicted, tehy deserve to face a public firing squad.\\n\\nCheck out the new blog - BUSHWACKER!\\nwww.blogger.com\\nhttp://al-aback.blogspot.com\\n\\nCertainly Satan has reserved a special oil-soaked corner of Hell for Bush, Cheny and Rumsfeld where they can spend their eternal damnation blaming each other for destroying the Earth.\\nBush has not done ONE productive thing since he stole the last two elections. However, he has:\\n\\n1. Massacred tens of thousands of Iraq's citizens and 2,500 U.S. soldiers;\\n2. Turned America into a police state where his billion-dollar boondoggle, Homeland Security, considers everyone guilty until proven innocent;\\n3. Tarnished America's reputation as a global leader and worldwide peacekeeper;\\n4. Contributed to the demise of the Earth through failed environmental and ecological policies;\\n5. Virtually eliminated the American middle class to a point where, within a generation, the U.S. will be a two-tiered society like Haiti and the Dominican Republic: there will be the very, very rich (Bush's buddies) and (the rest of us) the very, very poor;\\n6. Put the USA trillions of dollars into debt, which will take generations to pay off (if it ever can);\\n7. Neglected the poor, the sick, the aged, the disabled, the hungry and the disadvantaged in America;\\n8. Greedily played "Robin Hood in Reverse" by taking from the poor and giving to his rich friends, special interest groups, lobbyists, and mega-corporations who in turn make generous (if not illegal) campaign contributions to the GOP;\\n9. Given every other country in the world reason to fear us and a motivation to build their own nuclear weapons with which to protect themselves from the new "evil empire", the USA;\\n10. Tortured "prisoners", most of whom are being held without legitimate charges, and most of whom are being tortured outside of the rules of the Geneva Convention.\\n\\nThomas Jefferson once said: 'The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants." That time is way past due. It's time for a new American Revolution that will completely demolish the Republican and Democratic parties and eliminate the stranglehold these wicked power brokers have on American politics.

No, you can't be allergic to heat from a radiator, but you could be allergic to something used on the radiator (such as paint or a cleaning solvent) that is activated when it heats up and releases into the area.\\n\\nIf not that, radiators have a different effect on the moisture levels in a room than most other forms of heat. You might want to check the humidity levels in your place as high or low levels of moisture in the air can exasperate cold-like symptoms.
Riiiiiiiiiiiight. \\n\\nNever work on the problem; just get rid of those that notice it. The ole "sweep the problem under the rug" trick. Even though I love my job, I hate how the place is run. Disgruntled employee? Well YEAH! I am. And time and time again I see morale issues being handled by reprimanding us and telling us to "act professionally." Threats being made to people that are unhappy with how something is run is ludicrious. It's such a "control" thing. People in authority hate to say, "I'm wrong." So they transfer blame to the common man and try to make the weak feel weaker. It blows my mind that not all people are willing to step back from a situation and seriously look at solutions to the greater whole. \\n\\nSure, fire all of the unhappy people. You will then probably have an empty workplace. But hey.....there won't be any complaints about how you run things now. *cough* Until you hire your next bunch of heathens. ;)

Digital Subscriber Line, or DSL, is a family of technologies that provide digital data transmission over the wires used in the "last mile" of a local telephone network. Typically, the download speed of DSL ranges from 128 kilobits per second (kbit/s) to 24,000 kbit/s depending on DSL technology and service level implemented. Upload speed is lower than download speed for ADSL and symmetrical for SDSL.\\n\\nA leased line is a (usually) symmetric telecommunications line connecting two locations together. Unlike traditional PSTN lines they do not have a telephone number, each side of the line being permanently connected to the other. They can be used for telephone, data or Internet services.

Kamehameha, also known as Kamehameha I and Kamehameha the Great (circa 1758-1819), unified the Hawaiian Islands in battle and formally established the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi in 1810. A skilled diplomat, Kamehameha developed friendships with the major colonial powers in the Pacific resulting in the preservation of independence, as well as a guarantee of peace and prosperity of the kingdom, for future generations of native Hawaiians. Kamehameha is most noted for his vehement defense of traditional Hawaiian values and the kapu system of law and religion. He is also remembered for mamalahoe or the Law of the Splintered Paddle, used today throughout the world protecting the human rights of non-combatants in times of battle.

Both. Since they are in the funeral industry, they are happy to have the business. However, seeing the grief that people endure every day takes its toll. Very few morticians would say that they are happy to see people die, and caring for the dead can be somewhat draining due to the intensity of emotion shown by the survivors. But, to be realistic, every time someone dies, it puts food on the funeral director's table. That's the reality of the business. Death, for them, equals a paycheck.

no; according to Wikipedia, the easy on-line source for such information, there are two prevailing theories as to the origins of petroleum, and neither has to do with dinosaur bones:\\n\\nFormation\\n[edit]\\nBiogenic theory\\nMost geologists view crude oil, like coal and natural gas, as the product of compression and heating of ancient organic materials over geological time scales. According to this theory, it is formed from the decayed remains of prehistoric small marine animals and algae. (Terrestrial plants tend to form coal.) Over millennia this organic matter, mixed with mud, is buried under thick sedimentary layers of material. The resulting high levels of heat and pressure cause the remains to metamorphose, first into a waxy material known as kerogen, and then into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons in a process known as catagenesis. Because hydrocarbons are less dense than the surrounding rock, these migrate upward through adjacent rock layers until they become trapped beneath impermeable rocks, within porous rocks called reservoirs. Concentration of hydrocarbons in a trap forms an oil field, from which the liquid can be extracted by drilling and pumping.\\n\\nGeologists also refer to the "oil window". This is the temperature range that oil forms in--below the minimum temperature oil does not form, and above the maximum temperature natural gas forms instead. Though this corresponds to different depths for different locations around the world, a 'typical' depth for the oil window might be 4 - 6 km. Note that oil may be trapped at much shallower depths, even if it is not formed there. Three conditions must be present for oil reservoirs to form: a rich source rock, a migration conduit, and a trap (seal) that concentrates the hydrocarbons.\\n\\nThe reactions that produce oil and natural gas are often modeled as first order breakdown reactions, where kerogen breaks down to oil and natural gas by a large set of parallel reactions, and oil eventually breaks down to natural gas by another set of reactions.\\n\\n[edit]\\nAbiogenic theory\\nThe idea of abiogenic petroleum origin was championed in the Western world by astronomer Thomas Gold based on thoughts from Russia, mainly on studies of Nikolai Kudryavtsev. The idea proposes that large amounts of carbon exist naturally in the planet, some in the form of hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are less dense than aqueous pore fluids, and migrate upward through deep fracture networks. Thermophilic, rock-dwelling microbial life-forms are in part responsible for the biomarkers found in petroleum.\\n\\nThis theory is very much a minority opinion amongst geologists. This theory often pops up when scientists are not able to explain apparent oil inflows into certain oil reservoirs. These instances are rare.
With your college courses as a nondegree student at the community college, it would make you eligible to apply as a transfer student. It does have its advantages though because of the number of applicants is different than applying as a freshman.  It would also mean you would have to send your community college transcript, so you could get credit for the credits you have taken already towards your degree. I have included some links that could help you better understand the application and admission process. If you have further questions, talk to the transfer advisor at your community college or an admissions counselor at Boston College.

Send him a letter explaining how much you miss him.  Ask his forgiveness for any hurts he may have received, whether intended or not, or even known about.  The thing to remember is that people are very strange when they are stressed with family emergencies.  Also, he may be feeling guilty, or may be afraid of hearing "I told you so."  Under no circumstances should you bring up the past; let him discuss what he wants.  Additionally, if you do decide to meet with him, go alone.

The above answer is correct with respect to human anatomy. However, the shoulder girdle of most vertebrates has more bones. \\nIn most vertebrates, there is one important bone dorsal to the glenoid cavity (the place where the humerus articulates), that's the scapula. \\nThere's another important bone ventral to the glenoid cavity, the coracoid. \\nFor instance, in an amphibian there are well developed scapulae (with a suprascapular cartilage) and coracoids; and claviculae (ventral, situated anterior to the coracoids). The claviculae and the coracoid connect the shoulder girdle with the sternum.\\nReptiles have many variations including other bones (interclavicula, etc.)\\nBirds have strong scapulae and coracoids, and the claviculae fused in a furcula.\\nPrototherian mammals (platypus and echidnas) have a reptilian-like shoulder girdle; marsupials and eutherians only have scapula, because the coracoid has fused to it forming the "coracoid apophysis". The clavicle may be present or absent; it's usually well developed in animals that use their forelimbs for different movements (for instance climbing, manipulating food) and reduced or absent in others that are specialized for running.

This is going to sound weird, but it absolutely works: Put some ice cubes in there, and don't piddle around about it (make it quick).  It will shock your muscles into tightening up, which is what the problem is.  During sex the striations of your muscle walls in there are are spread apart and loosened up (especially after a climax), and that entire area becomes more vulnerable to friction issues,  which is what's causing the agitation you're experiencing.  Simply shock those striations and the skin over them into tightening up, and you should instantly feel a lot better.

Think about what you really want to do and have your resume at the top indicate what you want to do. Don't submit a resume that says you want an interesting job and leave it to the employer to decide where to put you. He or she will drop your resume in the garbage. You need a sentence like you want to find a sales job where you can use your strong interpersonal skills for example. Most people get their jobs from people they know so talk to people you know and let them know you are looking for work. You can also get the telephone book and call places you would like to work. For example, if you want to do mortgages, go to the yellow pages and call mortgage companies and get the name of the person to fax or mail your resume to.

Taj-ul-Masaajid: (The name is Masaajid and not masjid because 'masaajid' is plural of mosques and it literally means Crown Among Mosques) It is one of the largest mosques in Asia, built by Shahjehan Begum around a courtyard with a large tank in the centre and with an imposing double storeyed gate-way with 4 recessed archways and 9 imposing cusped multifoiled openings in the main prayer hall. The Quibla wall in the prayer hall is carved with 11 recessed arches, while the mimber is made of black basalt. The structure is enlivened by the limpid expanse of water in the tank outside the northern wall. The monumentality of this structure was much greater originally when it faced the towering bastions of the Fatehgarh Fort. A three-day Ijtima congregation was held here annually draws people from all over the world but has recently been shifted outside the City. Bhopal has over 400 mosques. Interestingly, Tajul Masaajid, perhaps the biggest mosque in India, faces the smallest mosque in the country that lies just on the other side of the road in the same area. The Dhai Seedhi Masjid (2-1/2 stairs mosque) was built in early 18th century when a rampart was converted into mosque.

People tend to have more credit today and to shop for credit - via the internet and other channels-more frequently than ever.  FICO scores reflect this reality.  However, research shows that opening several credit accounts in a short period of time does represent greater risk - especially for people who do not have a long established credit history.\\n\\nMultiple credit requests also represent greater credit risk.  However, FICO scores do a good job of distinguishing between a search for many new credit accounts and rate shopping for one new account.  Your FICO score takes into account:\\n\\n1) How many new accounts you have.  Your FICO score looks at how many new accounts you have by type of account (for example, how many newly opened credit cards you have).  It also may look at how many of your accounts are new accounts.\\n2) How long it has been since you opened a new account.  Your FICO score may consider this information for specific types of accounts.\\n3) How many recent requests for credit you have made, as indicated by inquiries to the credit reporting agencies.  Inquiries remain on your credit report for two years, although FICO scores only consider inquiries from the last 12 months.  FICO scores have been carefully designed to count only those inquiries that truly impact credit risk.\\n4) Length of time since credit report inquiries were made by lenders.\\n\\nSo in summary, if it's been some time since your last new line of credit was opened, or you last applied for a dept store card, opening and promptly closing a new account will more than likely not dramatically impact your score. On the other hand, if you plan on doing this regularly, I would recommend just waiting for the store sales to get that extra 15% off. Good luck!

Well, I'm not exactly sure what you are asking but the short answer to the major transcontinental railroads of today (known as Class 1s) are the Union Pacific (UP), BNSF, CSX, Kansas City Southern (KCS), Norfolk Southern (NS), Canadian Pacific (CP), Canadian National (CN), and soon to come, the Dakota, Minneapolis & Eastern.

MATTHIAS\\n\\nThe disciple selected by lot to replace Judas Iscariot as an apostle. After Jesus’ ascension to heaven, Peter, noting that not only had the psalmist David foretold Judas’ deflection (Ps 41:9) but David had also written (Ps 109:8) “his office of oversight let someone else take,” proposed to the approximately 120 disciples gathered together that the vacancy of office be filled. Joseph Barsabbas and Matthias were put up for selection; after prayer, lots were cast, and Matthias was chosen. Occurring just a few days prior to the outpouring of holy spirit, this is the last instance reported in the Bible of the lots being resorted to in determining Jehovah’s choice in a matter.—Ac 1:15-26.\\n\\nAccording to Peter’s words (Ac 1:21, 22), Matthias had been a follower of Christ throughout Jesus’ three-and-a-half-year ministry, had been closely associated with the apostles, and was quite likely one of the 70 disciples or evangelists whom Jesus sent out to preach. (Lu 10:1) After his selection, he was “reckoned along with the eleven apostles” by the congregation (Ac 1:26), and when the book of Acts immediately thereafter speaks of “the apostles” or “the twelve,” Matthias was included.

I think it means "being done with your work", so Heaven. Since God's rest came when His work was done, so we will too. The Sabbath is just a way to observe God's day of rest until we go through it in Heaven. I think.... so God bless you and I hope this will help.
Please pardon my language when I say...... HELL YES !!!!! Good guys like me are under so much pressure, that it's almost heart-stopping. It's 2006, and it would be nice that women show their independence and make the first move, and relieve some of that pressure we have bottled up. It's very hard for some guys to get a GF, because we're not jerks, and we try to show women that we're after the total package, and not just sex.

That depends on whether or not you consider a bass to guitar. There are plently of bands which have a guitar and a bass, for example AC/DC and The Who. There are also a plenty of bands that have two guitars IN ADDITION to the bass, for example The Allman Brothers and The Beatles.

Ocean currents have a tempering effect on the climate of Boston, MA. In other words, the ocean is warmer than the land in the winter, and colder than the land in the summer. This has the effect of making both the summer and the winter more mild than they are more inland, although the effect is not as strong as on the west coast of the US, because the prevailing winds blow from west to east in the US.\\n\\nAlso, because the ocean currents hitting Boston, MA are coming from the Carribbean Ocean, hurricaines occasionally make their way to MA.

This is easy...get him alone at a place where there will be no distruptions before he leaves. Tell him how you feel and use that now or never train of thought. Keep optimistic about it. I married my husband after he was my best friend for four years.
Me too!
Because we can't reverse the clock which is ticking every moment.
Stop arguing with him.  You did it, you got caught, you pay the price.  Whining and nagging him is only going to annoy him, and it makes you look even more immature.  Smashing pumpkins is stupid and destructive - that's why you do it when you're a teenager - and getting grounded is part of being a teenager, too.\\n\\nDon't worry - time will pass quicker than you think.  Just remain calm and let it lie.
Your 6-foot puppy probably is sorry - sorry he got caught, sorry you said "see ya" and sorry that he doesn't have a comfortable place to live.  Take it from someome who let the idiot back 6 - count 'em: 6 times.  Its not like I'm some stupid girl, I am an attorney, I was with him for 10 years and some part of me just thought it would all turn out ok.  It didn't.  Eventually he left me for the same girl that he got involved with 6 months earlier - and of course he was so sorry then - but when she called him telling him she missed him, well what could he say?  So he left me for her.  And somehow I was upset about this - ahh the human mind.  Anyway - your puppy is never going to change.  My new mantra will be - one chance - if I realy realy like you, anything more than that and you're out.  Who knows, maybe it will be less than one chance.  I suggest the same for all women, unless they like the abuse...

The summer solstice is the longest day of the year, respectively, in the sense that the length of time elapsed between sunrise and sunset on this day is a maximum for the year. Of course, daylight saving time means that the first Sunday in April has 23 hours and the last Sunday in October has 25 hours, but these human meddlings with the calendar and do not correspond to the actual number of daylight hours. In Chicago, there are 15:02 hours of daylight on the summer solstice of June 21, 1999.

no not at all. sexy is all in the way you view yourself. If you walk confidently people notice and it is sexy no matter what your size is. of course your body type appeals to certain people because everyone has their own preference. some guys like skinny, some like curvy, hell some guys like big mammas. Case in point everyone has their own sexyness that will attract a certain someone if they work it right.  so dont wonder if you are sexy...just be it.

Its not easy as you will need to obtain a queen ant before you can start the colony. Making the nest is easy just a perspex box with soil in, make it about 3 inch wide but it needs to be big, they will make there own channels & you can see them in the box living there life.Plus you need a food source. Depends on what type of ants you gets, Ants can be herbivores & Carnivores.So best to try & get leaf cutter ants or something.
I cannot speak on the air of formality as far as if the dust from the shell is toxic to the point that it can kill you, however I do have some personal experience with the dust.  In the pursuit of making some earrings, I inhaled a very small amount of dust into my lungs.  I could immedietly taste the calcium (similar taste and smell to your teeth getting drilled) and became nausious.  After about fifteen minutes I was having a hard time breathing altogether and ended up going to the hospital.  The doctors said that the dust has very small amounts of toxin in it, as does the meat of the abalone and both are extremely dangerous in large amounts.\\n\\nso my advice to you, and this is what i do now, is to wear a simple gas mask.  The gas mask I chose to get was roughly $60 and I have had absolutely no problems since i bought it.  When it comes to one's health, you can never be to careful or too cheap.
I dont believe that our politicians are liars any more than anyone else.  They probably live more honestly than most.  Anyhow, we live in whats known as a "representative republic".  That means our elected officials are chosen by whom best represents the people there, or at least the people that voted.  So, if you think all politicians are liars you can do two things:  1. be vocal about the fact that you want someone who is honest and will do what they say they will do (George W. Bush did do that look it up) and 2. you vote.  People often get the leadership they deserve.
So her doc is thinking she may have Antiphospholipid syndrome, right? So this disease is diagnosed by checking for anti-cardiolipin antibodies. Antibodies have 2 main types: IgG and IgM. Since her IgG is increased it may suggest a rheumatic disease, like Anti-phospholipid syndrome, or it could be a ton of other diseases, that's why she should see a rheumathologist, s/he is more capable of making the diagnosis of a rheumatic or collagen disease. These include: Rheumatic arthitis, Sjorgen's Syndrome,  Lupus (many types, not all of them ANAS +), and so son.

you should deffinitly just tell your parents. all of you should sit down and discuss it. as for your getting married, marrige is all about compromising. you both think you are right and  neither of you want to give in. you just have to think what is more important to you- him or you being right? sit down and talk with him about how you feel and dont let it turn into an argument. it wont hurt to listen to him and try to agreeabout some things. tell how much it bothered you what he did,. if you dont tell him he will never know and then how can he change? keep in mind that noone is perfect, and even the best of marriges have these fights. if you guys are engaged chances are you love him, and love is not the easiest thing to come by. every bride has second thoughts, if you didnt, it would just be weird. remember, marrige is a two way street, you both have to meet halfway, and sometimes you have to go a little further, just keep on thinking what is more important. winning a stupid argument or your marrige. i hope this helped you. good luck and congradulations!
If you are in the United States and ship to India, you will be required by the Post Office to fill out PS Form 2976 Customs Declaration. In it, you will state the quantity and detailed description of the contents, weight and total value. The recipient on the other hand may pay custom duties on the item/s received depending on the rules of their postal services. \\n\\nSellers on eBay as well as other sellers anywhere on the Internet -- whether you use the post office, private shippers or customs brokers -- are all required to fill out the custom form when shipping to buyers. Ecommerce companies like Amazon and eBay sellers do not shoulder the custom duties for the buyer, as the buyer will have to pay for that. I know of Adsense publishers in England who received some techie gift goodies from Google last Christmas who were charged with duties on the items received. A buyer from the Philippines who purchases books from US-based Amazon may pay custom duties on the items received.\\n\\nMost of the small items that ship out are not inspected by customs, though there are countries (especially during holiday season) where they are more strict and inspect and open the packages received.\\n\\nHope this helps\\nIsabel Isidro\\nFor information on starting a business, visit http://www.powerhomebiz.com
My friend that is a great question , one that has been kicked around for awhile. \\n\\nI agree why should we only remember the veterans for a short time when we should be remember there sacrifices all the time , it's a shame that as you said, "the young people in the world today are becoming more and more ignorant to what happened in the wars ". \\n\\nI think that something should be done about this but it apparently has become common place to only give thanks for sacrifices once a year.

After the United States killed Osama bin Laden, he was met at heaven's gates by George Washington who punched him in the stomache.  Thomas Jefferson kicked him in the groin, Benjamin Franklin electrocuted him with with his kite key, and 46 other guys beat him up really bad.  When they all left, Osama walked up to God and asked, "Hey, what's going on here, I thought..."  God knew what he was going to ask, so he answered him quickly, "I told Muhammad that you would be met by 49 Virginians, what did you think I said?"

This is tough, but you are obviously dealing with an HR staff that doesn't have enough faith in their company.\\n\\nSalary ranges are one of those areas where you only see what YOU want.  For example.  If HR says the job pays from $35-$40k a year.  They want to hire you at $35k.  But if you say, my range is $35-$40k, you really want $40k.  It is just natural human perception.\\n\\nEven though your attitude is correct, salary negotiations should not be discussed until the point the company wants to hire you, you are stuck in this one.  If you don't put the range on, HR will can your resume because you didn't follow a simple direction.  They have asked for this because they have found that what the company thinks the skills are worth, and what people that hold the skills think their worth, are two very different things.\\n\\nYou have no choice, but you can beat them at their own game.   Just keep it very vague, something like:\\n\\nRequested Salary Range:  Mid $40's \\n\\nJust don't be tempted to lowball your requirements to get the interview.  If you do, your offer will never be what you want, it will be what you stated.\\n\\nGood luck

Tell yourself you are going to go, but only for 10 minutes.  Once you are there, the same inertia that kept you from going will now be working to keep you from leaving early.  Also, unless you are training for a marathon or something, there is no need to go everyday.  Space it out and give your muscles a chance to rest and recover.

The formula for determining compound interest is:\\nAt = Ao (1 + r/n)^(n*t)\\n\\nTo determine how long it takes your money to double, use the following:\\nAt = 2 = amount at time t\\nAo = 1 = amount at beginning\\nr = .07 (7%) = rate of interest\\nn = 2 = number of times compounded yearly\\n\\nAt = Ao (1 + r/n)^(n*t)\\n2 = 1 * (1 + .07/2)^(2t)\\n2 = 1.035^2t\\nlog 2 = 2t log 1.035\\nlog 2 / log 1.035 = 2t\\nt = (0.30103 / 0.01494) / 2 = 10.07 years (solution)\\n\\nCheck:\\nAt = Ao (1 + r/n)^(n*t)\\n2 = 1 * (1 + .07/2)^(2*10.07)\\n2 = 1.035^20.14\\n2 = 1.9994 (close enough!)\\n\\nNow, for the above formula, to find t, given the other values:\\nAt = Ao (1 + r/n)^(n*t)\\nAt / Ao = (1 + r/n)^(n*t)\\nlog (At / Ao) = (n*t) log (1 + r/n)\\nn * t = log (At/Ao) / log (1 + r/n)\\nt = log (At/Ao) / n log (1 + r/n)

Yes it does happen but I think less often these days.  \\n\\nIn the extreme exertion of a marathon the body loses fluids, electrolytes (salts) and tends to overheat.

Either way (lump or swollen gland), it should be treated as a serious problem.\\nI had felt 2 lumps in my neck.  I had it checked out with an ultrasound.  It was benign, but it was caused from pimple/acne drainage.  The thyroid and lympatic system are all very sensitive areas for women.\\nPlease have it checked by a physician.

um... when i was growing up, the black guy in my private school did pretty well. Not only was he popular, and smart, he was also a jock. \\n\\nIn my son's private school, the black kid is the genius of his class. They even skipped him ahead two grades (I didn't agree with that, because he was one of my son's good friends and now he doesn't see him anymore). \\n\\nNot all black boys do particularly badly in school, I guess it just depends on who their parents are.\\n\\n-----------\\nAfter reading more of the responses, I began to wonder how many people who answered here ACTUALLY know black people or have them as friends or peers? It seems like many people are responding only to what they hear on the media or with their limited experience with Black people. \\n\\nI've known many black people who are upper middle class, well educated and have BOTH parents. Unfortunately I went to an all girls high school, so i did not include that information since the question specifically asked about black BOYS.  \\n\\n<sigh> I don't know how the rest of the world works, but in my experience the black people I've come across have been as intelligent as anyone else, and sometimes more so. \\n\\nThe only time, I've come across ignorant black kids was when I tutored reading in poor school districts, but many of the kids were ignorant regardless of race. Yes, those kids had tough lives and had bad role models. Many wanted to work in Mc Donalds when they grew up so they wouldn't be hungry. But the ignorance WASN'T race dependent. And I found that the ignorance could be rectified. All the kids needed was someone to believe in them,  to work with them and someone to look up to.\\n \\nBTW, I'm Asian American. <sigh>

I think she liked you as more than a friend and you shot her down. The last thing to do in a situation like that is stop talking to the girl because then she thinks that it's all her fault that you aren't talking to her. She's sad because she got her heart kind of broken by the person she considered her best friend. If you don't like her, you don't like her, but let her gently. She isn't the one acting stupid honey, you are. Especially since youcouldn't tell that she really liked you. I think she got embarassed whe you told her no basically, you didn't like her so she hid from you. Then, she thought she was a horrible person because you didn't call her. Then, when she gets up the courage to call you, you guys don't get a chance to talk. Just go up to her and say, I want us to still be friends and you're really important to me so I hope we can start talking and hanging out because I miss you.
Since 1995, scientists have discovered more than 70 new planets and planetary systems, but most don't resemble our solar system. Instead, scientists have been surprised to find gas giants orbiting very close to their host stars. Theorists speculate that some of these large planets may have migrated inward because of gravitational interactions with the protoplanetary disk.

This is not exactly an answer, but have yuou considered asking yourself or anyone else, why we have military bases in Nigeria? Why?? Because Nigeria has something we want. If there is something to gain, we support those who help us get it. \\n\\nThink about it. I don't know where you live. But in the United States, Nigeria was an unspoken word until the latter part of last year. No one cared about Nigeria. I did when I found that  Clintom and George Bush were getting serums together for HIV victims. That was the "clue".
"George Mason (December 11, 1725 – October 7, 1792) was a United States patriot, statesman, and delegate from Virginia to the U.S. Constitutional Convention. He has been called the "Father of the Bill of Rights".\\n\\nMason wrote the Virginia Declaration of Rights, which detailed specific rights of citizens. He was later a leader of those who pressed for the addition of explicitly stated individual rights as part of the U.S. Constitution. His efforts eventually succeeded in convincing the Federalists (such as James Madison) to modify the Constitution and add the Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments of the Constitution). The Bill of Rights is based on Mason's earlier Virginia Declaration of Rights. The French Revolution's Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was also based on George Mason's work.\\n\\nAlthough a slave owner himself, Mason favored the abolition of slave trade, and withheld his name from the U.S. Constitution in part because it failed to do so."\\n\\n"He and his wife had twelve children, nine of whom survived to adulthood."\\n\\n\\nSo either he couldn't stand up because he was dead, or when he was alive, because he was having so much sex.

You've already been told of the physical effects. Now, get a hold of the emotional ones. Someone who dies from the effects of smoking needlessly leaves behind loved ones to mourn. My sister smoked heavily for years, she died 4 years ago and left 3 young adult children who'd already lost their father when they were teens. She now has beautiful grandchildren she will never see.

The English is slightly archaic but still plainly readable. It is already just a list, so summarizing it doesn't make it much smaller.

Bacteria plays a very important role in the nutrient cycle, such as the nitrogen cycle. They help decompose dead matter too, returning the nutrients in the dead matter back to the ecosystem.\\n\\nBesides that, there are lots of bacteria in the human gut, that plays an important role in aiding digestion. \\n\\nIn modern science, bacteria plays a big part in biotechnology, such as in the manufacture of cheese, yoghurt, production of wine etc. because bacteria is necessary in fermentation. It's also used as a vector, for splicing and inserting the insulin gene during the commercial production of certain drugs like insulin, for the diabetic patients.\\n\\nHope this helps =)

Christians believe that a man named Jesus died on the cross, and there is more proof about that event than Julius Caeser, but I can see your point about how some Christians make Christianity seem like you say. But not all Christians are like that. I am a Christian, you might be too, but there is no danger whatsoever of people reducing it to subjective truth because Christian's faith is too strong for it fall to that.

From a guys perspective and also one that is going through the same thing, be harsh, be rude, and most of all be upfront. I made that mistake of being the "nice guy" with my ex-wife and found that in the end I gained nothing and lost everything. After you tell him like it is, then change your number, for me it was the best thing I could have done. And if he continues to call you then you may need to take the next step and take legal action. Good luck, be strong, and don't let some bonehead get you down.

Now notice carefully the end shown in: \\n\\nDaniyl 12:4-7—\\n4 But you, O Daniyl, shut up the words, and seal the book to the time of the end; many will run to and fro, and knowledge will be increased.\\n5 Then I, Daniyl, looked; and behold, there stood two others, one on this side of the bank of the river; and the other on that side of the bank of the river.\\n6 And one said to the man clothed in linen, who on that future day is teaching: How long will it be to the end of these wonders?\\n7 Then I heard the man clothed in linen, who on that future day is teaching, when he held up his right hand and his left hand toward heaven, and vowed by Him Who lives forever, that: It will be for a time, times, and a half, when Yahweh will have accomplished pouring out His power through His holy people, all these things will be finished. \\n\\n\\nYahweh again shows us the end, in a time—three and one-half years, that is filled with destruction. The first time (3½ years) was the first half of the seven year peace plan that was stopped in its midst (Daniyl 9:27). Then Yahweh shows us times in Daniyl 12:7. One time is 3½ years; times is 3½ years plus 3½ years, which equals 7 years. \\n\\nThe seven year peace plan started October 13, 1993, shut down April 13, 1997 after three and one-half years of action. The seven year peace plan stayed shut down for a duration of two times, that's seven years and was signed back into action on April 13, 2004 on the very day prophesied. \\n\\nPresident Bush and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon restarted the seven year plan on the very day Yahweh showed it would go back into action. \\n\\n\\n------------------------------...\\n\\n\\nWe Are Now In The Last Three and One-half Years (Time) Of Man's Governments Of And By The People \\n\\nDaniyl says it will be the greatest time of trouble ever. \\n\\nDaniyl 12:1—\\nAnd at that time will Micahyah stand up, the great ruler who stands for the children of Your people; and there will be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation to that time. And at that time your people will be delivered, everyone who will be found written in the Book of life.\\nThe Savior says the same. \\n\\nMattithyah 24:21-22—\\n21 For then will be great tribulation, such as has not come to pass since the beginning of the world to this time—no, nor ever will be.\\n22 And unless those days were shortened, there would no flesh be saved; but for the elect's sake, those days will be shortened. \\n\\nIn this same time period there is extreme hatred among the nations. For proof of this, all you have to do is watch the world news. \\n\\nMattithyah 24:7—\\nFor nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines, and pestilences; disease epidemics, and earthquakes in place after place. \\n\\nThen comes the nuclear wars that will darken the sun. \\n\\nMattithyah 24:29—\\nImmediately, but after the tribulation of those days will the sun be darkened, and the moon will not give her light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. \\n\\nNow learn a parable so you will know when this time is at hand. \\n\\nMattithyah 24:32-33—\\n32 Now learn a parable from the fig tree: When its branch becomes tender and puts out leaves, you know that summer is near.\\n33 In the same way, when you see all these things, know that His coming and the end of the age is near, at the very door. \\n\\nPlease notice, these are things we can see taking place. Compare this with the following. The Apostle Shaul spoke of the same time in: \\n\\nI Thessalonians 4:16-17—\\n16 For Yahshua Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the malak gadol, and with the trumpet of Yahweh. And the dead in Messiah will be raised first,\\n17 Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet Yahshua in the air; and so will we ever be with Yahshua. \\n\\nThese two verses and the following go together in the same time perio

I agree as well.  You should list all of them.  Employers want to understand your progression.  If those job are irrelevant to what you are applying for then just put the dates, job title or function, and city, state.  That should be enough to erase any initial doubts about what you did in life before that.  But be prepared to answer any questions about those roles and if they have any bearing on your abilities as an employee or how they shaped you as a person.
since the base of one triangle is 9/5 of the other, the height of this triangle is also 9/5 of the other. \\narea1 = (base)(height)/2\\ntherefore area2 = ((9/5)base)((9/5)height)/2\\n                          = (9/5)^2 [(base)(height)/2]\\ntherefore the area of the larger triangle will be (9/5)^2 = 81/25 times that of the smaller triangle
Ascites is defined as an excessive amount of fluid built up within the peritoneal cavity. Both the abdominal organs and the abdomen itself are lined with membranes called the peritoneum. Between these two linings is a space referred to as the peritoneal cavity. In pathological conditions that result in edema, or excessive fluid accumulation in bodily tissues, fluid can build up in the peritoneal cavity.  \\nA septate uterus is a uterus with a dividing wall of tissue (septum) within the uterine cavity. It can be treated with surgery if the tissue is thick, but if the tissue is thin it usually poses no problem during pregnancy.\\nAs for what caused your condition, ask your doctor.  He or she is the best source for your medical questions.  Ascites, in itself, is not a disease, but rather a symptom of several other pathological conditions.

We are only beginning to be able to detect planets within an order of magnitude of the mass of Earth. Just a couple months ago, we found the smallest rocky planet yet discovered outside the solar system, orbiting a star 20,000 light years away. It's about 5 times the mass of Earth, and has a larger orbit (and orbital period), about 2.6 AU (and orbits in about 10 years). It's also very cold, about 50 K (-370 F), as it orbits a red dwarf about a fifth the mass of the sun.\\nIt was discovered with a new technique called gravitational microlensing, which can only be used occasionally. However, as this planet is one of three so far detected by microlensing, scientists think it implies that earthlike planets may be much more common than previously realized.\\n\\nThis isn't much of an answer to your question, but, honestly, the closest (non-earth) planet which is capable of sustaining intelligent life could orbit one of the two primary stars in the Alpha Centauri system (the nearest star system to the sun, at 4.3 light years away; there are three stars there, the larger Alpha Centauris A and B, and the distant companion Proxima Centauri) for all we know. The only way we'd have to find such a planet (without the presence of extremely rare astronomical conditions which allow microlensing) is the spectroscopic method, which has a difficult time finding any planets which are not a) extremely massive, and b) orbiting extremely close to their star. \\n\\nThe two primary Alpha Centauri stars could have rocky planets orbiting at less than 2 AU (Mars has an orbit of about 1.5 AU), and Alpha Centauri A is a metal rich G2 type star like our own sun, while Alpha Centauri B is a metal rich K1 star, which is in the band of spectral types which may be suitable for life-bearing planets.\\n\\nIn short, we don't know. They could be everywhere, including practically on our doorstep, or they could be relatively rare, and not found for thousands of light years from Earth. We'll have to wait until our methods of finding planets improves to know for sure.

Science_rebel said in response to a question:\\nThe Persian Empire was a series of historical empires that ruled over the Iranian plateau. The political entity which was ruled by these kingdoms is the country now known as Iran (literally "Land of Aryans"). Generally, the earliest entity considered a part of the Persian Empire is Persia's Achaemenid dynasty (648–330 BC), a united Aryan-indigenous kingdom that originated in the region now known as Fars and was formed under Cyrus the Great. Successive states in Iran prior to 1935 are collectively called the Persian Empire by Western historians
I believe there is a chance that we will eventually, however I would not say that it would make us win the world cup, cause teams create great players all the time and doens't mean they are gonna win the World Cup, look at Spain and England, and even Argentina hasn't won in awhile.  To win it takes a good mix of luck and talent.  Right now the closest thing we have to a possible Pele, or Maradona is Freddy Adu, and while I think he is a great player, I don't believe he will be as good as them, but he is developing nicely, he is only 15 or 16 I am not sure.

Digital Subscriber Line, or DSL, is a family of technologies that provide digital data transmission over the wires used in the "last mile" of a local telephone network. Typically, the download speed of DSL ranges from 128 kilobits per second (kbit/s) to 24,000 kbit/s depending on DSL technology and service level implemented. Upload speed is lower than download speed for ADSL and symmetrical for SDSL.\\n\\nA leased line is a (usually) symmetric telecommunications line connecting two locations together. Unlike traditional PSTN lines they do not have a telephone number, each side of the line being permanently connected to the other. They can be used for telephone, data or Internet services.

A bit is 1/8 of a dollar or 12.5 cents.\\n\\nYou can figure that out from context too.  2 bits, 4 bits, 6 bits, a dollar.  In sequence that means they are describing 25 cents, 50 cents, 75 cents, a dollar.  Thus a bit is half of 25 cents.\\n\\nThe origin of bit comes from the practice of cutting the Spanish dollar (peso) into eight radial pieces to make change.\\n\\nThe term persists colloquially in the United States as a holdover from colonial America when Spanish dollars minted in Mexico, Bolivia and other Spanish colonies were the widest circulating coin. Spanish dollars were deemed equivalent in value to a U.S. dollar. Thus, twenty-five cents was dubbed "two bits," as it was a quarter of a Spanish dollar.  Because there was no one-bit coin, a dime (10c) was sometimes called a short bit and 15c a long bit.\\n\\nEven the New York Stock Exchange continued to list stock prices in eighths of a dollar until June 24, 1997 (at which time it started listing in sixteenths, but later going to decimals in 2001).\\n\\nIn computers there are eight bits in a byte... so there might be some relationship there to the Spanish bits... I'm not sure. \\n\\nAnd do you remember that knock pattern (dum-da-da-dum-dum, dum dum)?  The words to that are "Shave and a haircut, two bits"  That must have been awhile ago because I certainly can't get a haircut these days for 25 cents... or if I could, I'd be afraid of the results.  :-)

Most racquet manufacturers that make junior models match racquet length to age. The attached link recommends a full-size between age 10-12 or when the junior player reaches a weight of 85 pounds. I played competitive junior tennis and switched to a full-length racquet when I was 11, but that was when juniors still played with low-tech racquets. \\n\\nIn general, you can go with a full-size racquet as long as the length doesn't interfere with stroke mechanics and the player can handle the weight. Sticking with a junior racquet for too long could encourage the player to hit with too much arm and wrist, and not enough hip and shoulder. \\n\\nBest recommendation is to go to a local pro-shop, get some current tips, and demo a bunch of racquets with varying lengths.

Of course, daylight saving time means that the first Sunday in April has 23 hours and the last Sunday in October has 25 hours, but these human meddlings with the calendar and do not correspond to the actual number of daylight hours. In Chicago, there are 15:02 hours of daylight on the summer solstice of June 21, 1999.

Haram is what Allah has forbidden, for example, Pork, adultery, and so on.\\nMakrooh is what is discouraged. For example, oral sex (yes, this is fact.) is makrooh because the human fluids are considered dirty and that's why you have to wash yourself (Ablution) before prayer to cleanse yourself if you have ingested, spilt, dispensed, any bodily fluids whether you have commited intercourse or not.\\n\\nThere has been some debate about smoking being haram or makrooh. My Saudi friend tells me it is actually haram, because what is addictive and harms your health is definately haram.

Ozone depletion:\\nthere are many chemicals and agents that we use on a daily basis, many people are unaware of the damage these can cause. As these element raise above, they damage the protective layer which keeps oxygen,hydrogen and monoxide in. This protective layer is basically an umbrella to shield us from the harmful rays of the sun...as it is depleted, more and more damaging rays will continue to reach the surface of the earth and cause all types of disease and problems.\\n\\nGreen House Effect:\\nOver the years, Ozone depletion has taken it's tole on our icebergs and ice caps. As these begin to melt, our water and sea levels begin to rise. It is like placing a lid on boiling water, steam will begin to boils and thus "global warming" will accrue....... Warmth continues to grow faster than we can control and our green earth will begin to dry up, in time we will become a dessert and need more sunscreen just to exist on the surface...\\n" we can't stop the damage that's been done but we can slow it down and allow mother nature to heal.... \\n\\n\\n\\nQ. What is the greenhouse effect? Is it the same as the ozone hole issue? \\n\\nA. No, they are two different (but related) issues.The greenhouse effect issue concerns the warming of the lower part of the atmosphere, the troposphere (the layer in which temperature drops with height; it is about 10-15 kilometers thick, varying with latitude and season), by increasing concentrations of the so-called greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and others) in the troposphere. This warming occurs because the greenhouse gases, while they are transparent to incoming solar radiation, absorb infrared (heat) radiation from the Earth that would otherwise escape from the atmosphere into space; the greenhouse gases then re-radiate some of this heat back towards the surface of the Earth.\\n\\nThe ozone hole issue concerns the loss of ozone in the upper part of the atmosphere, the stratosphere, resulting from increasing concentrations of certain halogenated hydrocarbons (such as chlorinated fluorocarbons, known as CFCs). Through a series of chemical reactions in the stratosphere, the halogenated hydrocarbons destroy ozone in the stratosphere. This is of concern because the ozone blocks incoming ultraviolet radiation from the Sun, and portions of the ultraviolet radiation spectrum have been found to have adverse biological effects.\\n\\nThe greenhouse effect and ozone hole issues are, however, related. For example, CFCs are involved in both issues: CFCs, in addition to destroying stratosphere ozone, are also greenhouse gases. It has traditionally been thought there is not much mixing of the troposphere and stratosphere. But there is recent evidence of transport of stratospheric ozone into the troposphere (see "Ozone-rich transients in the upper equatorial Atlantic troposphere," by Suhre et al., Nature , Vol. 388, 14 August 1997, pages 661-663, and the related discussion paper, "Ozone clouds over the Atlantic," by Crutzen and Lawrence, on pages 625-626 in the same issue of Nature ). So ozone depletion in the stratosphere could result in reduced concentrations of this greenhouse gas in the troposphere. Conversely, global climate change could also affect ozone depletion through changes in stratospheric temperature and water vapor (see "The effect of climate change on ozone depletion through changes in stratospheric water vapour," by Kirk-Davidoff et al., Nature, Vol. 402, 25 November 1999, pages 399-401).

From 1991 to the present day the United States Air Force and Navy have slaughtered over 200,000 civilian people in Iraq with Depleted Uranium missiles, cluster bombs, cruise missiles and other so-called “smart bombs.”\\n During the “Desert Storm” terror campaign the arsenal also included fuel-air bombs and napalm. 177 million pounds of bombs were dropped on the people of Iraq in the most concentrated aerial bombardment in the history of the world. In the 110,000 sorties of the six-week onslaught the cowardly American and British pilots (and to a lesser extent French and Saudi pilots) mass-murdered at least 200,000 people, using depleted uranium missiles, napalm, cluster-bombs, fuel-air bombs, cruise missiles and other so-called “smart bombs.” The slaughter of civilian people in the Amariyah bomb shelter was a Prime example of this American/British state terrorism. Most of them were women, children, elderly, and invalids from a new housing development. Cowardly U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force jet pilots caught one sixty-mile-long column of fleeing Iraqi soldiers and Palestinian civilian families in vehicles on the Kuwait to Basra highway - and pounded them ruthlessly with bombs and machine-gun fire. The road, clogged by four lanes of one-way, bumper-to-bumper traffic, was carpet bombed by B-52s dropping 1,000-pound bombs, and repeatedly hit with laser-guided missiles and “smart” bombs. All the Iraqi soldiers, as well as Palestinian workers and their families, were slaughtered without mercy. The bloodthirsty American pilots gleefully described the massacre as “shooting in a sheep pen.” \\n During the Desert Storm terror campaign at least 944,000 rounds of Depleted Uranium ammo were fired from American A-10 Warthogs all over Iraq and Kuwait . When a depleted uranium tipped shell strikes a tank or armoured personnel carrier it easily penetrates the armour and burns the crew alive. The impact also vaporizes the depleted uranium, creating an aerosol of radioactive heavy-metal particles which can spread as far as 190 miles on the wind. When inhaled or ingested, the depleted uranium particles cause chemical and radioactive damage to the bronchial tree, kidneys, liver and bones. Cancer often results, and the effects can even include genetic damage. \\n The Dutch Laka Foundation estimates that the United States terror campaign left behind 300-800 tons of radioactive waste from this ammunition all over Kuwait and Iraq - poisoning the air, the land, the water and the people everywhere. Afterwards, wherever the depleted uranium firing had been concentrated, there were cancer epidemics among Iraqi civilians living nearby. In the ten years since then, sanctions, polluted water and depleted uranium together have killed somewhere between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 Iraqi civilian people. At least 600,000 of the dead are children. Cancer rates have quadrupled in areas of southern Iraq bombed by the American and British state terrorists. Since it began, thousands of Iraqi babies have been born with horrible birth defects. This is something that has never before been seen in Iraq . \\n Over the course of only 43 days and nights, approximately 62,000-80,000 air-delivered cluster bombs were dropped on the Iraqi people by the American-led state terrorists. In addition, 10,000 MLRS rockets and 100,000 “Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition” artillery shells were fired. All this translates to about 24-30 million “sub munitions” or bomblets. Assuming a dud rate of 5%, it is estimated that the number of Dangerous land-mine cluster bomblets lying on or just under the surface of the ground in Iraq and Kuwait would be from 1.2 to 1.5 million. At least. In the desert, however, the percentage of these duds rose to 30%. So the number of unexploded ordnance still lying in wait for unsuspecting Iraqi children and civilian people could be as high as 7 to 9 million bomblets. A Human Rights Watch report says that of the estimated 24 to 30 mi
This is a repeat answer but its very important to understand\\nyour wife's love language.\\nRead THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES.\\nAccording to Dr. Chapman, the five love languages are Quality Time, Words of Affirmation, Gifts, Acts of Service and Physical Touch. \\n\\nWOW WARRIOR IM VERY  IMPRESSED!\\n \\n\\nQuality Time refers to spending time together as a couple. People who have this as their love language feel loved when they are taken out on special dates, when their spouse clears the calendar for them, or when the television is turned off in order to have a conversation.\\n\\n \\n\\nOthers prefer Words of Affirmation as a way to be shown love. Telling your spouse how you appreciate them, encouraging them, and general words of praise and acceptance all show your love.\\n\\n \\n\\nIf Gifts is your spouse's love language, then you need to understand that for them, gifts are not simply material objects -- they are expressions of your love. \\n\\n \\n\\nIf your spouse's love language is Acts of Service, they will appreciate your help more than anything. Give them a night off from cooking or other household chores. Repair that leaky faucet. Help them with the yard work. Prepare them a nice lunch to take to work. \\n\\n \\n\\nSome people prefer Physical Touch as their love language. A simple touch on the arm, hug or backrub will convey your love to them.  \\n\\n \\n\\nProblems occur when spouses do not recognize each other's love language and attempt to show love in ways that are less meaningful to the other spouse. For example, consider if your spouse has the love language of Acts of Service, but you assume they would rather have gifts. They might be appreciative of your presents, but your love would be more obvious to them if you helped them around the house. To them, a cleaned house means more than a box of candy.\\n\\n \\n\\nSo find out what your spouse's love language is and show them love in the ways that they can best understand.
Fit and slightly muscular. It'll take quite a bit of energy to run up and down the fields shouting yourself hoarse. Also, if it's stunting, you'd need to be even more fit/muscular because you'd have to support the cheerleaders at the top. To be the cheerleader at the top, you'd have to be small in physique, thin and less than 100 pounds so that the other girls can support you.\\n\\nI hope this helped.=)

Physically, the stomach can expand and take up all the space around the surrounding organs to actually fit the food inside--but that doesn't explain the weight. I remember hearing (sorry about the lack of source) that once you get to an outrageously large amount of food your body just wont take up the energy anymore... it would have to be an extreme amount, like in a hotdog eating contest.\\nAlso, unless they train all year round, constantly, I assume their body naturally regulates by eating a smaller amount throughout the rest of the year.

Absolutely. And my wife and I used to go garbage picking in various neighborhoods the night before garage pickup. We've gotten all kinds of good, resaleable things. Such as a wine cart, book shelves, expensive electric typewriters, more things than I can even think of right now. It got so bad, we've had to quit, because we don't have room for everything. A good place we found to dumpster dive was behind a local Kmart. We've gotten a power saw, drills, flowers, plants, books, bags of dog food, cat food, lots of unopened potato chips bags, gum, health food bars, etc.. that had just recently expired. \\nThe funniest time (looking back) was when I was in a dumpster and it started raining, I had trouble getting out, then it started to lightening, and it was amazing how I managed to fly out of that metal dumpster. My wife, who was watching, thought it was hilarious.

Because it is just too much information and can be very stressful and it's probably just overwhelming to try to take it all in at once.\\n\\nTry breaking everything down into little parts at a time.

Study good and read through it and take notes and decide to quit after the one chapter, then move on to the next when you are ready, the next day, or whatever; however much time you have allowed for you.

I had a dream I saw Jesus in Jerusalem when I was a very little girl.  I lived in the mid-west, but in the dream we were in Jerusalem.  I thought I saw something, so I left my mother and went into an alley.  The alley was really dark, and every so often there were people who were playing out Jesus's life.  When I got to the end, he was there.  He held out his hand, and I woke up.\\nI only had this dream once, but boy do I remember it!
Boy. There are a lot of people answering this question who really don't know the rules in this country. I speak from 11 years of law enforcement experience, many of those specifically developing traffic offenses into greater crimes. So people don't think I am feeding you a line of police BS, I included the laws that established each of the rights and reasons to search. Feel free to research them yourself so you can see I am giving you the straight scoop.\\n\\nThere are many times when the police can search your entire car, including your trunk, glove box, and even locked containers within your car, without a warrant. I'll lay out four of the most common techniques I use to search cars.\\n\\n(1) Consent. Can't go wrong here. If you ask for consent to search and the driver (or person in charge of the vehicle) gives you consent, you can search the entire vehicle. The consenting party has the authority to withdraw their consent and/or limit the areas you can search.\\n\\nOn reasons (2) through (4) consent makes no difference. If the police can meet one of these requirements, they will legally search your car with or without your consent.\\n\\n(2) Probable Cause. If you develop probable cause during a traffic stop, you may search the vehicle without a warrant. This is commonly called the "motor vehicle exception" to the search warrant rule. The authority for the police to do so was first established under a US supreme court case called Carroll v. United States. The courts have since expanded on this case and allowed the police to search items within the vehicle regardless of who claims ownership of the items. Under this technique, the police can only search areas where it is reasonable to believe the contraband they are searching for may be found. For example, if the police believe they are lookng for a rifle, they would not be able to search a purse. However, if they find the rifle and now believe they might be looking ammunition, the search of the purse is good.\\n\\n(3) Pursuant to arrest. If the police arrest you for a bookable offense while operating a motor vehicle, they may search the areas under your control (including the passenger compartment and possibly other areas of the car) for contraband or weapons that you may have discarded. This authority is established under case law named Chimel v. California.\\n\\n(4) Inventory search - If the police have the authority to tow your car, they may search it under the premise that they need to inventory all items contained within the car prior to towing the car. These searches were upheld under the community caretaking doctrine established under South Dakota v. Opperman.\\n\\nThere are other ways to get into a car. Too many to go into here. Truthfully, there is almost NEVER a time when the police need a warrant to search a car. In my 11 years, I think I have obtained a warrant for two or three of the probably 1000 cars I have searched, and those cars were firmly secured in the police impound lot pending the warrant.

Prepare adequately (study) for at least a week or more and don't stay up late each nite. Get plenty of rest on the day of the exam. Then on exam day, DO NOT EAT anything 1 hour before the exam. Eat something (high protein and non-greasy food only) 2 to 3 hours before the exam. Then right before the exam, drink soda pop (Mountain Dew or JOLT is preferred). This last advise is crucial. If you can't find any colas like Coke or Pepsi, drink honey mixed in water. You need the sugar, bottom line, specifically your brain. If you eat before the exam, your brain would be too busy to help you concentrate so eating before the exam is a no-no.

If it's a faith that you're seeking, I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for.\\n\\nBeliefnet has some great quizzes along the lines of "What religion am I?" and some other good stuff too.

There's actually no need to choose. Each of those three things you're choosing from may be focused on at different times. Getting too engrossed in one slows your growth as a person. You have to be able to move between different ideals. It's what makes a well-rounded individual.\\nTake me for example, I love all the same things as you. I'm also really into Tolkien, Dungeons and Dragons, and the like. Yet, I am quite well-attuned to the realm of science, as I am a registered nurse and nurse educator. I am also a lover of literature as it makes me retreat to a quiet place after indulging into the intricacies of both science and fantasy.\\nTry it. Focus on each one in turn. But not on all at the same time. It's easier that way.
Happy actually not only a expression, but happy also good for our health...Happy also a choice, we can either live with better and more happy everyday? or we can choose sad and unhappy that make us look more worst in front of people or bad for our health plus may also effect our emotion too.\\n\\nso, be happy and start learn to enjoy life with what we have or left...as people that always require too much before they can happy will never become happy people :)

This is going to sound weird, but it absolutely works: Put some ice cubes in there, and don't piddle around about it (make it quick).  It will shock your muscles into tightening up, which is what the problem is.  During sex the striations of your muscle walls in there are are spread apart and loosened up (especially after a climax), and that entire area becomes more vulnerable to friction issues,  which is what's causing the agitation you're experiencing.  Simply shock those striations and the skin over them into tightening up, and you should instantly feel a lot better.

You dont need a doctor..all a doctor is going to do is give you medication and way to may people are on medication that dont need to be. I know because my doctor tried to do the same thing to me and I dont need medication. Your depression sounds situational..in fact the reason you are depressed is because you cannot go home. You really want to go home so your frusterated that your not getting what you want. All you can do is be patient and accepting of the situation you are in now and make the most of it..try and be kind to your friends, and speak to those who may have similar experiences to yours. If worse comes to worse speak to a councellor, but dont run off to the doctor and get meds unless you feel like killing yourself etc. Im sure once you come to terms with not getting what you want youll feel a bit happier again.,
Before we were conceived we were in a place sorting out things from our previous lives, getting ready for when we would start all over again as the baby of someone else (usually in the same family as we had been in before).

LOL. Yep, they probably would! I am a democrat, I live in Texas so I have to deal with a helluva lot of dumba$$ repubs at work.

The last 15 years? Well, that would either be Michael Jackson or Madonna. Both created their own unique sound and had many other artists in the past several years come out and try to be like them. For Michael, that would be Usher, Justin Timberlake, and the like. For Madonna that would be Britney Spears, Christina Aguiliera and the like. They were both massive pop icons in the 80's and 90's. While Michael has lost most of his American following due to his legal issues, he is still one of the top recording artists in European and Asian countries. Madonna, on the other hand, continues to re-invent herself with each new album. This is shown in her most recent release of "Confessions on a Dance Floor". She's physically in the best shape she's been in for several years and her sound still makes people get up and move.

Marijuana is classified as a depressant.  This is an oversimplification.  It has many depressant effects, like the relaxation you refer to, but it also stimulates the brain's frontal lobes, where "executive thought," or "higher order processing," occurs.  This means that the area of your brain where you do most of the thinking that you're aware of is stimulated, so you're going to have more thoughts than usual flowing around up there.  Some people are mentally strong enough to use these thoughts constructively, and we call this "being creative."  Some people cannot control their thoughts, and we call this "being paranoid."  Some people can usually control their heads, but in certain situations, cannot.  So the subjective experience is different for every person, every time.  \\n\\nI had a creative writing teacher once who discounted all drug stories.  "You don't really know if that's insight, you were just high, and that was just a drug thought," she would say.  She was completely wrong.  You get to take credit for every positive thing you do on drugs, just as you are responsible for every mistake you make, high or sober, as if it makes a difference.

Capitalism is an economic system in which the means of production are mostly privately owned, and capital is invested in the production, distribution, and other trade of goods and services for profit in a market. These include factors of production such as land and other natural resources, labor and capital goods. Various theories have tried to explain what capitalism is, to justify or critique the private ownership of capital, to explain the operation of markets, and to guide the application or elimination of government regulation of property and markets.\\n\\nCommunism is an ideology that seeks to establish a future classless, stateless social organization, based upon common ownership of the means of production. It can be classified as a branch of the broader socialist movement. Early forms of human social organization have been described as 'primitive communism' by Marxists. However, communism as a political goal generally is a conjectured form of future social organization. There is a considerable variety of views among self-identified communists, including Maoism, Trotskyism, council communism, Luxemburgism, anarchist communism, Christian communism, and various currents of left communism, which are generally the more widespread varieties. However, various offshoots of the Soviet (what critics call the 'Stalinist') and Maoist interpretations of Marxism-Leninism comprise a particular branch of communism that has the distinction of having been the primary driving force for communism in world politics during most of the 20th century. The competing branch of Trotskyism has not had such a distinction.\\nKarl Marx held that society could not be transformed from the capitalist mode of production to the communist mode of production all at once, but required a transitional period which Marx described as the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat. The communist society Marx envisioned emerging from capitalism has never been implemented, and it remains theoretical; Marx, in fact, commented very little on what communist society would actually look like. However, the term 'Communism', especially when it is capitalized, is often used to refer to the political and economic regimes under communist parties that claimed to embody the dictatorship of the proletariat.\\n\\nIn the late 19th century, Marxist theories motivated socialist parties across Europe, although their policies later developed along the lines of "reforming" capitalism, rather than overthrowing it. The exception was the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. One branch of this party, commonly known as the Bolsheviks and headed by Vladimir Lenin, succeeded in taking control of the country after the toppling of the Provisional Government in the Russian Revolution of 1917. In 1918, this party changed its name to the Communist Party, thus establishing the contemporary distinction between communism and other trends of socialism.

I got thoroughly fed up with "Colloquial Arabic" .I find that all of Jane Wightwick's books are excellent. Her introductory book, "Mastering Arabic" is still in print. With the cassettes or CDs, it costs around £29. The book alone is around £15.\\n\\nIf you wish to delve into Islamic culture, there is also "Quranic Arabic" by Dr Murty, with 2 CDs, available from around £25 in any good, Islamic bookshop.\\n\\nAs a learner, I found it useful to set a target of memorising 10 new words and two rules of grammar a day. Copy examples of the grammar rules into a notebook to understand how the grammar works, then using previously learned vocabulary, compose new sentences similar to the examples . \\n\\nYou have to do something every day because you can soon forget words owing to the lack of any similarities with English. I test myself on the previous 7 days' 10 words before learning the ten new ones. (If you can learn 50 words a week, you will have mastered the basic vocabulary of 1,000 words in about 20 weeks and then you will have "broken the neck" of the language and can start making real progress. Tell yourself not to give up for six months because it is a hard language and it's very tempting to abandon it early on. To reach a stage of 98 percent understanding, you need a vocabulary of 3,000 words for "A" level and 5,000 words for a degree.\\n\\nThe lack of similarities makes learning words very hard. I have a system that works but people think I am daft. I find substitute English words and associate them with the meaning of the Arabic word, e.g., Arabic for Gospel is 'injeel so I picture a bible in jelly - daft? sure, but it works. Horseman in Arabic is faaris (written faarisun) so I picture a horse with faires on.\\n\\nI really wish you every success because even though English literature is vast , Arabic culture and literature is an ocean of enjoyable, different and often brilliant delights. Enjoy the rewards of the hard work you are about to start.

Flag burning, while despicable, is free speech. I heard a senator say something along the lines of "men and women gave their lives to protect this flag, the least we can do is protect it ourselves." While that is a noble sentiment, the truth is that no one ever gave their lives to protect the flag, they gave their lives to protect what that flag stands for, and for better or for worse, part of what that flag stands for is the right to burn it if you please. Please do not interpret what I am saying as supporting flag burning, just supporting free speech.

The payouts for win, place and show are based on a $2 ticket. For the exotic bets, such as exactas and trifectas, the answer is "it depends." Each exotic listing will usually tell you if the payout is based on a $2 or $1 (or 10c) bet, but it the exotic does not tell you, you can safely assume that it is based on a $2 bet.
Let's answer that question with some more questions, shall we?\\n\\nWhen you go down on a woman, where are you focused and is that where she wants you focused? Do you use a hard tongue or soft tongue? Do you use your fingers in addition to your tongue? If so, what are you doing with them - in other words, what kind of motion are you making? Do you listen to how she's breathing? What does it mean when she holds her breath? What does it mean when her legs tense up?\\n\\nIf a man knows the right answers to all those questions, he's in the game.\\n\\nIf not, she's better at giving than him, guaranteed.
People are naturally protective of what they recognise as a safe environment for living, and they see anything that deviates from their perceived notion of the good as being a threat. The problem with this is that it is not conducive to social harmony and will ultimately culminate into violence. A primary cause of this 'stand- offishness' is that of the economic theory of capitalism, which is inherently dangerous, as it pools wealth into the hands of the few, and leaves the have-nots to fight amongst themselves for scraps. This leads to greed, selfishness, and the imperative to seek power over others through any means necessary.

He could be arrested, but it wouldn't amount to anything now.  If the girls mother wanted to press charges, he could have been charged with at least statutory rape.  Since the girls mother gave permission for them to marry, she can no longer file charges--therefore, there isn't really a case here for him to be arrested for.  Having a baby is one of the stupidest reasons to get married!  That decision is going to haunt them for the rest of their lives.  Being married is hard enough when you're old enough to realize all that it means--at their age, they barely know how to wipe their own butts!  Adding a child to the mix is just asking for trouble--I don't care how mature you are, or how well you think you're prepared for it--parenthood changes everything!  Having a child first, then getting married because you have a child is, from my own personal experience, a VERY big mistake!  I'd rather see 2 people who love and care for their child never marry than marry and be miserable.  I hope your friends mother is ready to not only raise her own child, but her grandchild and a son in law as well!  Make sure you stick around for your friend--somehow I think she's gonna need as much support as she can get in the very near future--when her life totally falls apart.  I wish her luck and truly hope she won't be another statistic, but I'm being realistic and calling it how I see it--a bad situation that will get much worse.
Dude, talk about old skool....\\nDid "Kid" ever cut his f*<king hair, btw?\\nI would try looking on-line to see if they have "fan clubs" <snort> or forums or whatever.

LOL.. No, that is not how it works. At this time we have an abundance of natural resources. More than enough for everybody to have a decent standard of living. In fact we waste more natural resources worldwide than we actually use. The poorest nations being often the biggest wasters. \\n\\nThe concept that all should just be instantly shared with everybody has allure for the scared and desperate. The lulling thought that you will always be taken care of. That some devine fairness will magically appear in a species which has always in the past had to work so hard to establish fairness and justice. Hate to bust your bubble but it aint going to happen. People are people and communist systems like that breed corruption even faster than other systems. Think about it this way. You have a computer, which is something the majority of the world doesn't.  Should they not chop up the parts in your computer to pay for food in a nation that used to produce excess food until a corrupt Government took over and destroyed the agricultural system?  Should you be responsible for the mistakes made in another nation which you personally and your nation had nothing to do with? \\n\\nIn reality barter/trade is the fairest system we've yet devised. Taking something away from somebody will only instill hostility and bitterness. It doesn't make the person you give it too any more wealthy. It just makes all poor. Instead of some being miserable all are miserable except for an elite core which replaces the rich with an even deeper and less challlengble elite caste. So in the end all your suggestion accomplishes if it were implimented is to remove all chance you personally have of gaining wealth. It will make life even less fair. It will make the poor poorer as redistribution is both an incentive not to produce and costs resources which means there is still less left to go around. \\n\\nYou want to help the poor then help them learn self sufficiency and fight corruption wherever you find it. Corruption is the main cause of poverty. It is injustice embodied. A bribed politician is the cancer of civalization.
"luctari" means to wrestle or to struggle.\\nSo the Latin verb (luctari) is in the passive voice. No active voice exists in Latin for this verb. Yet it translates into English verbs in active voice (to wrestle, to struggle).\\n\\nHence, "luctantur" means "they wrestle" or "they struggle", not "they were wrestled" or "they were struggled".\\n\\nThere is no "luctant" in Latin, only "luctantur". Some verbs in Latin are just like that. They use only the passive form but have active meaning. So to translate them you just use active voice as if it didn't worry you one bit why the Ancient Romans chose to use these verbs in this way. ;)

Yes. \\n\\nIf you know you have pending taxes, the best way is to contact the IRS and make the arrangements to file. You must file first.  It is required.  That way you will know better where you stand and you are beginning to be in compliance. Then you can talk about how to pay the amounts indicated by your returns.\\n\\nThe payback scheme is based upon the income you need to live.  This may mean such things as changing the kids to public school, one telephone in the house, eating in, etc.  In the old days this was called "tightening your belt".  By the way, the IRS has charts that give working numbers for living expenses according to family size and other criteria. You must document your necessary expenses.  \\n\\nIf you let the default go, interest will accrue and worst things begin to happen, such as a lien being filed against you(which then becomes a public record), your employer could be contacted and your paycheck could be affected.\\n\\nDon't give excuses unless they are legal.  “I was irresponsible and I want to rectify my mistake”, is probably more palatable. Work with the tax man and he will work with you.\\n\\nNo, I don't work for the IRS.

If the market expects interest rates to continue to rise, the value of bonds will continue to decline. If you don't understand why, you should not invest in them. (It is because the bond price reflects the 'discount' from final bond payment based on the prevailing interest rates.)\\n\\nShares, in general, perform worse in periods of high interest rates.\\n\\nBut this is where your skill as an investor comes in. Research for companies who you expect to perform regardless of the the state of the economy.

There are various legends about how the Tigers got their nickname. One has to do with the orange stripes they wore on their black stockings. Another has to do with a sportswriter equating that 1901 Detroit club's opening day victory to the ferocity of his alma mater, the Princeton Tigers.\\n\\nHowever, the truth is revealed in Richard Bak's 1998 book, A Place for Summer: A Narrative History of Tiger Stadium. In the 19th century, the city of Detroit had a military unit called the Detroit Light Guard, who were known as "The Tigers." They had played a significant role in certain Civil War battles and also in the then-recently-fought Spanish-American War. The ballclub had informally acquired that nickname as a minor league club, but upon entry into the majors they sought and received formal permission from the Light Guard to use their trademark, and from that day forth the ballclub was officially the Tigers.\\n\\nIn short, the Tigers wore stripes because they were already Tigers, rather than the other way around which is the conventional story.

My experience says yes. My former wife is a nurse and they gave free flu shots for family members at her hospital.

Personal digital assistants (also called PDAs or palmtops) are handheld devices that were originally designed as personal organizers, but became much more versatile over the years. A basic PDA usually includes date book, address book, task list, memo pad, clock, and calculator software. Many PDAs can now access the Internet via Wi-Fi, cellular or Wide-Area Networks (WANs) or Bluetooth technology. One major advantage of using PDAs is their ability to synchronize data with a PC or home computer.\\n\\nThe term "personal digital assistant" was coined on January 7, 1992 by John Sculley at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, referring to the Apple Newton. Earlier devices like the Psion and Sharp Wizard have the functionality to be considered PDAs, however. In fact, PDAs by other names were available as early as the mid-1970s -- first as very advanced calculators, then as electronic organizers, and later as palmtops. [1].\\n\\nPDAs are some times refered to as "Palms" or "Palm Pilot" after an early PDA created by Palm, Inc. This usage is a case of genericized trademark, similar to refering to a tissue as a "Kleenex"; or a bandage as a "Band-Aid".\\n\\nThe currently major PDA operating systems are:\\n\\nPalm OS - owned by Palm, Inc. \\nWindows Mobile (Pocket PC), (based on the Windows CE kernel) - owned by Microsoft \\nBlackBerry - owned by Research In Motion \\nMany operating systems based on the Linux kernel - free (not owned by any company) These include: \\nGPE - Based on GTK+/X11 \\nOPIE/Qtopia - based on Qt/E Qtopia is developed by Trolltech, OPIE is a fork of Qtopia developed by volunteers \\nSymbian OS (formerly EPOC) owned by Ericsson, Panasonic, Nokia, Samsung, Siemens and Sony Ericsson \\nMany PDAs run using a variation of the ARM architecture (usually denoted by the Intel XScale trademark). This encompasses a class of RISC microprocessors that are widely used in mobile devices and embedded systems, and its design was influenced strongly by a popular 1970s/1980s CPU, the MOS Technology 6502.\\n\\nAccording to a Gartner market study, the overall market for PDAs grew by 20.7% in the third quarter (Q3) of 2005, compared to Q3 2004, with marketshare resolving as follows (by operating system):\\n\\nPalm OS for Palm, Inc. PDAs and some other licensees- 14.9% (declining) \\nWindows Mobile for PDAs that comply with the Microsoft's Pocket PC specifications - 49.2% (increasing) \\nBlackBerry OS for BlackBerry PDA (produced by Research In Motion) - 25.0% (increasing) \\nSymbian OS - 5.8% (increasing) \\n\\nPopular PDAs\\n \\nPalm IIIxe PDAPsion \\nApple Computer Newton \\nBlackBerry \\nhp iPAQ Pocket PC (Originally Compaq iPAQ until HP merged in 2002) \\nPalm Pilot, Tungsten, LifeDrive, Treo and Zire \\nSharp Wizard and Zaurus \\nSony CLIÉ \\nTapwave Zodiac \\nAlphaSmart Dana \\nDell Axim \\nGMate Yopy \\nFujitsu Siemens Loox 720 \\nList of PalmOS Devices \\nAbacus_PDA_Watch \\n\\nVarious operating systems based on the Linux kernel for various special designed PDAs (many other supported) - 0.7% (stable) \\nOther - 4.4% (stable) \\nThe reason usually cited for the resumption in PDA market growth (after market declines in 2002 - 2004) is the growing interest in PDAs offering wireless email capabilities (such as BlackBerries), and PDAs with built-in GPS capabilities for navigation. Smartphones — mobile phones with PDA-like abilities will likely curtail PDA growth in the near future, as smartphones are becoming very popular.

I love the Amplified Bible. It gives insight into things like this. The NIV, which you are quoting, is not very accurate, by the way - use a parallel Bible with several versions beside each other, and it'll help.\\n\\nMoses neglected to circumcise one of his sons because his wife (Zipporah) was opposed to it. Therefore, he was honoring the will of his wife above the command of God.\\n\\nIt was very important for Moses to learn that God means what he says at this point, because he was going to be leading the nation of Israel and representing God to them.

try this strategic trick:\\n\\n1. go to your bank first where you are familiar with the people. ask them for a loan, get the interest rate and the plan and all details, check for any hidden extras.\\n\\n2. check online at all the banks offers (including your bank) print the best offers that you may get (i am sure u will get a lower interest rate than your own bank) from reliable banks.\\n\\n3. now be very cunning: go to the first step with a twist, show them your research, and show them the best deal you have got from the internet.\\n\\n4. mostly they are ready to negotiate and ask them for a lower rate than the one you have researched. mostly they will discuss (privately with some hidden manager) and  get back to you. \\n\\n5. if they give a lower rate you have striken a jackpot, if not go to the internet loan offer.\\n\\nhurrah now you can feel that consumer is a king. and you have nothing to lose.\\n\\ngood luck.

Tough call. Dealing with schoolyard bullies is one of the hardest things to learn. You _should_ talk to a teacher. The bully will see that as weakness. Bullies are usually stupid and feel inferior and have no good tools for dealing with life. Try to understand. Above all, don't lose your self respect. If you decide to fight, give no warning, just paste him as soon as he starts to hassle you. But be aware that most schools will discipline both parties in a fight, because there is no place for violence in schools. So the first thing to do is talk to a teacher or principal.

I think that you need to find a good balance between being a 'nice' guy and a bad boy! It can be very off-putting if you seem like a yes man, one who can't do enough for you and agrees with what you say and what you want to do all the time. It comes across as a bit spineless. (Of course when it is the "time of the month", this is exactly how you should act!!) I don't think women like to be treated badly as such but there is a sense of excitement and danger with a slightly edgy type of guy. It makes the 'chase' phase of the relationship last a little longer and for some women this is the best part!\\n\\nSo I'm not saying, be a real bast*** or anything, just make it seem like you are holding a little of yourself back to make yourself seem aloof and it may just do the trick!\\n\\nGood luck!

As far as practicing law in the US, you would need to pass the bar exam in the jurisdiction where you wanted to practice.  The qualifications to sit the bar vary from state to state so you'd need to contact the State Bar where you wanted to practice.\\n\\nThere's another alternative that might be of interest, especially if your are of expertise is in business law.  Many American corporations have subsidiaries or production facilities in foreign countries.  They need to ensure that they don't violate local laws and their American staff attorneys are pretty useless for this.  You could be valuable to them if they have facilities in your native country, particularly if you have strong English skills.
If there are uneven places, they would need to be behind background areas that would not be noticeable, unless there is a high-tech adjustment on the printing end that I kind of doubt (cost-prohibitive). Otherwise, I suppose it would stick on like any billboard, using smaller connecting sheets.

Aren't both parties cheating in this situation?  The wife is not only having sex with someone besides her husband, but it is homosexual sex also.  Does that make her in the wrong twice as much or does it not count as cheating at all?  Just a thought.\\n\\nAs for the man, yes, he is cheating, but with permission.  It's not a glorified way to cheat, it is approved cheating.  What can the wife say if she is also having sex with the third party?  \\n\\nFor the most part, men have this fantasy to boost their ego.  The idea that they can satisfy more than one woman at a time and then try to prove it correct is just huge to men.  As for who the two girls are, it doesn't matter.  As a matter of fact, I think that the man would have even more fun if neither one of the women were his girlfriend or wife.  This way he doesn't have to concentrate mostly on one woman.

Sweetie don't hate yourself. 135 pounds is not heavy. You are beautiful no matter what your weight is. \\nNo there are not any creams for cellulite removal or stretch marks. No matter what anyone says, cremes can not help to smooth out skin or help to fix the stretch marks. All that can help the cellulite is doing exercises that will help firm up your legs. Do alot of running and leg squats. Firming up areas where cellulite and stretch marks are, can help them look lighter.

The biggest problem is paying for it.  Because it is more expensive than regular school.  You can apply.  there are many organizations that do it.  But a family has to choose to take you.  Most families don't want to take in a student.  Because it costs money to feed them etc.  So even if you get in the program you might not be able to go if a family doesn't choose you.  \\nYou can get in with normal grades.

Its equivalent to proving\\nm*n = (lcm(m,n) ) * ( gcd(m,n) )\\n\\nNow, i'll have to use basic number theory. The idea is to show that the number of times a prime factor of m*n occurs on the LHS is equal to the number of times a prime factor of (lcm(m,n) ) * ( gcd(m,n) ) occurs on the RHS.\\nNote : LHS = Left Hand Side\\n       RHS = Right Hand Side\\n\\nFor any prime factor p of m*n, call it p. Now say p occurs to the power of h in m and power of k in n. That is to say m "contains" p^h while n contains p^k. Note that h,k are nonnegative integers. \\n\\nNow, in lcm(m,n), we would choose p^ [ min(h,k) ] while\\nin gcd(m,n) we would choose  p^ [ max(h,k) ]   \\nNote that min (h,k) means minimum of h and k, similarly  max (h,k)means maximum of h and k . For example, if h=2 and k=3, then min (2,3) = 2. while max(2,3) = 3. If say h = k, then obviously in both lcm and gcd of m*n we choose p^h to be in its product. This is true for EVERY prime factor of m*n.\\n\\nSo, consider the product (lcm(m,n) ) * ( gcd(m,n) ).\\nFor EACH prime factor p of m*n, we have shown above that it occurs as { p^ [ min(h,k) ] } * { p^ [ max(h,k) ]   }, that is our RHS product contains \\n  p^ [ min(h,k) +  max(h,k) ] = p^(h+k)\\nNow, in our LHS, p occurs as p^h * p^k = p^(h+k) too!!!\\nThus, we have shown for each prime factor, p of m*n, it occurs as the same product in both the LHS and RHS. And thus\\nwe have LHS = RHS. Done.\\n\\nOne question may circle in your mind, that is how i know that [ min(h,k) +  max(h,k) ] = (h+k)\\nWell, this is a fact.\\n\\nFurther, if you want to show it, consider 3 cases.\\n\\nCase 1. ( h = k)\\nHere min(h,k) = min(h,h) = h\\nand  max(h,k) = max(h,h) = h\\nSo, [ min(h,k) +  max(h,k) ] = h + h = 2h.\\nAnd (h+k)= h + h = 2h.\\n\\nCase 2. ( h < k)\\nHere min(h,k) =  h, because h is smaller.\\nand  max(h,k) = k, because k is bigger.\\nSo, [ min(h,k) +  max(h,k) ] = h + k \\n\\nCase 3. ( h > k )\\nHere min(h,k) =  k, because k is smaller.\\nand  max(h,k) = h, because h is bigger.\\nSo, [ min(h,k) +  max(h,k) ] = k + h

That will contain the info you need and contact information\\n\\nIt is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\\n\\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\\n\\nEven if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\\n\\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \\n\\n"The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments."

Some seedless fruits are grown from grafts on existing trees.   Seedless grapes are not technically seedless, although they are seedless for practical purposes. Seedless grapes are different than most seedless fruits because the seeds initially develop but abort when they are very tiny embryos. So,  in seedless grapes, normal fertilization does occur. You can often see \\nthe remains of the aborted seed in the mature fruit. Seedless grape breeders can remove the tiny embryos before they abort and grow them in tissue culture to produce a mature plant. This is termed embryo rescue.

It depends how you define your number system.\\nFor example, the decimal number system in everyday use states 1 + 1 = 2\\nBut if you define 1 differently, such as in base 2 maths (binary maths) then the previous answerer was correct in stating 1 + 1 = 10\\n\\nAlternatively if you define 1 as a symbol, not a number, then 1 could represent anything.\\nE.G, you could define a whole new number system which goes 3,2,1,6,5,4... etc\\nwhere 3 is the first number, 2 is the second number... etc\\nThis would be very confusing!! But the point i'm trying to make is that the concept of "one", "two" or "three" is not dependent on the symbols we use for them, 1, 2 ,3.

The problem here is your attitude towards your boyfriend because you are trying to make of him a different human being and that is unlikely to happen.  You are with someone because you accept him the way he is and that's all...

Believe me!  I think I'm even worse because I take into consideration global warmth).  \\n\\nYou seem to be perfectionist, methodical, neat, the kind of person who has defined her aims clearly and this is not good or bad this is you, this is the individual you are.

Well I may not have as many anger issues as you do, but I am sick of pretty people who have no musical talent like Jessica and Britney and the like, and I'm also growin very weary of that horny rap they play on the radio (especially that "laffy taffy" song... eeeewwww)...I mean, some rap is good and very insightful, but that crap is just annoying...theres only so much sexism, objectification of women, yapping about how much money, cars, clothes and "dubs" you have, and how much alcohol you drink that I can take...My suggestion: stay away from top-40 stations...
no matter what you think, the people in your life love you and care for you deeply and would it would tear them apart if you do commit suicide.. turn to them for help.. i would hope that you wouldn't want them to feel what you're feeling 100 times worse if you were gone..

most everything you listed, if not all, was already known to be there and marked by the UN and the seals were not broken.\\nnow the roadside mustard bombs you mentioned, were stolen from where they were stored(which the UN and the US already knew about and they were sealed) after there was nobody around guarding the place when we took over.  it is also thought that those IED's were made without the insurgents realizing what they were using as a munition...if that is true or not, who can really say, but areas where weapons are stored, especially the ones that we did want saddam to use or have, should have been secured! instead of running around looking for ones that weren't there.  guard the ones that you know about first! then go look for others.\\nbut to sum it up...that stuff wasn't "found" if anything it was/is proof that the UN inspections worked the first time, and would have worked the second time, since in all those years saddam could have very easily removed the seals and used the stuff.  christ, i hate defending that guy, but skewing facts is wrong.

I used to have this same setup on my server.  I used a free CGI script called Profile Manager Basic (version 3.0).  When a family member wanted to sign in, I simply gave them a username and password that was the same for everyone related.  They would go to the sign in page, where the .htaccess file would grant them permissions to enter and add their contact information as well as see all other family members contact info.  Very good and extremely simple to implement.  As for the server may I suggest a few things?  First is the Abyss Server a free one from Aprelium Technolgies. http://www.aprelium.com/abyssws  Next is to visit http://www.no-ip.com and set up a free port forwarding account.  Combined you can see the results below on my site.  Vary easy to maintain connection, and extremely reliable.

I'm white, and I understand you completely. You just need to think that just because the people you have been experiencing are bad, they don't represent their whole race. The thing is, the white people you experience who are racist are just idiots. I have nothing against any race. I hate black idiots. I hate hispanic idiots. and I hate white idiots. It has nothing to with race. You can dislike the hispanics on your street and dislike the racist whites at your school, but don't dislike the entire race just because of one person (or a SMALL group of people).

Obtaining someone elses credit report without permission is a federal offense.  That said, it used to be as easy as knowing your SSN and birth-date.\\n\\nNowadays, it is a little more tough.  Online Credit agencies will ask several security questions that are not easy to answer.\\n\\nFor example, they might say something like:\\n "Which of the following accounts did you close in 1999:"\\n   "a) Sears"\\n   "b) Home Depot"\\n   "c) Chase"\\n   "d) Citibank"\\n\\nThere are a series of these questions, whatever they know from your SSN, they can ask for, addresses, accounts, etc.\\n\\nNow, somebody like a spouse in an ongoing divorce can easily know all that information and obtain a credit report.  However, even this inquiry will show up on the credit report.  If you pull it yourself, you could see that someone else got it (not always easy to read).\\n\\nIn the case I mentioned of a spouse in a divorce  it is hard to tell what the authorities would do.  It would likely not be investigated, and it depends on the state and judge.  If there was an order to respect the others privacy, it would at least be contempt of court.\\n\\nBut again:\\n  - every time your credit-file is pulled, there is a entry made (stays for 3 months)\\n  - it is a federal offense, if you think someone got it against your will, call the agency you got your report from and ask for an investigation.\\n  - Last but not least, all your creditors are allowed to pull your credit on a regular basis
Its called a manometer. A U shaped device half full of water with on end connected to, for example, an air duct and the other end open to the atmosphere. The pressure in the duct will force the water in the manometer up the atmospheric side so many inches. The pressure is then measured in inches of water.
it can lower the water table in that area, causing other wells to go dry or will require future wells to go deeper.
Being "Black Listed" isn't a formal list.  It refers to a bad reputation that makes someone a less than desirable employee, making it hard for them to get employed.\\n\\nThe most famous was the Communist witch hunt.  In this instance, it was created by the government.  Many intellectuals, actors, writers, etc. found themselves unable to get employment because the refused to take part in the witch hunt.  Government agencies threatened harassment if any employer hired these people.\\n\\nThe government has also made these "Virtual black lists" for other reasons.  Howard Stern could claim this.  In early days, many comedians found themselves in this situation because their routines were considered too racy.\\n\\nSome scientists have also claimed government harassment because they spoke out against the governemnt policies or left government employment.\\n\\nSocial institutions can also create a virtual black list.  In these instances, they typically try to use economic pressure to prevent employment of individuals.  \\n\\nA person can be black listed if they gain a bad reputation in their industry.  For example, if an engineer or architect designed a bridge, building, or other structure that failed, they might not be able to get employment in their industry, even if they are cleared later.\\n\\nA person can also be "Black listed" for famous behavior or notoriety shunned by society.  For example, if someone was accused of a well publicized crime and later found innocent, the reputation of the accusation could follow them making employment difficult.\\n\\nIf a person has had a lot of difficulties at several employers, they can find themselves black listed as their bad reputation follows them from 1 employer to the next.\\n\\nYou can also find yourself black listed in a company because of a well known goof up or just because a higher level manager doesn't like you.  This can effect pay raises, how you are treated, and your general level of happiness in a company.\\n\\nIn summary, to be effective, black listing requires at least 1 of the following:\\n-Government involvement\\nInvolvement by a social institution (such as religion)\\n-Well publicized notariety\\n-A small community (a small town)\\n-A small industry with few employers

Sure - go for it.\\n\\nIf nothing gets done call you local paper or news station you can remain anonymous.\\nSomething will happen and under the whistleblower laws you are protected.\\n \\nIn general, to prove a violation of a whistleblower law, the employee must show that 1) her or she engaged in statutorily-protected conduct; 2) the employer took adverse action against him or her; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action.\\n\\nNow under federal law, specifically the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, any person who "interferes with" the employment or livelihood of an employee for providing any truthful information to legal authorities relating to the commission or possible commission of any federal offense, can be imprisoned for up to 10 years, and pay a fine up to $250,000.

Well, the US fought its own bloody civil war on the way to nationhood; perhaps it’s a right of passage democracies have to go through. Imagine if there had been a third power standing between the Yankees and the Confederates saying ‘cant you guys just all get along?’ Yea…right…. Would have gone down a treat.\\n\\nThe US is now no more than the meat between the two slices of bread trying to eat each other. Those who can afford to flee Iraq are doing so at a rate equivalent to 1% population per month. 1%…. that’s bad, real bad…. Do the math, civil war is inevitable and is already there, its just not yet very organised. That is changing. Blood will point the way to the future, and rather a lot of it.\\n\\nHow on gods earth the Americans thought they could bring democracy to Iraq is beyond me, a high school history student should have seen this coming. Power held for centuries by a 30% minority now suddenly and effectively disenfranchised from power by democracy. Who would swallow that? I know what will happen though; the US will pull out of Iraq and support the government against the anti government ‘insurgents’… which will be on a percentage of population basis more than those Americans who voted for Bush.

basic speed training are assisted and resisted speed training. Assisted training (also called overspeed training helps to improve stride frequency. Resisted speed training helps to improve speed-strength and stride length.  to improve your speed off the mark and acceleration. \\nA typical session may consist of approximately 5 sets of 10 reps\\n\\ntry some of these sprinting technique drills like these could help improve your technique\\nRaise Knees: 10 meters - jog - 10 meters - rest\\nSprint 10 meters concentrating on raising knees as higher than normal. Jog for 10 meters and then sprint for 10 meters and rest. \\n\\nFast Knee Pick Ups: 10 meters - jog - 10 meters - rest\\nJogging on the spot raise your knees to waist height while emphasising arm action. Move forward 10 meters with this action concentrating on the number of ground contacts rather than how fast you cover the distance. Try to get as many ground contacts as possible. \\n\\nFlicks: 10 meters - jog - 10 meters - rest\\nWhile sprinting over 10 meters concentrate on flicking your heels up to touch your butt. \\n\\nLeg Speed: 60 meters\\nThis is a normal sprint over 60 meters except all of your focus should be on your legs. Try to gauge the optimum leg speed for you by taking different stride lengths to see which yields the best results. \\n\\nHigh Hops: 3 x 40 meters\\nBound from one foot to the other. The action is similar to skipping except your are trying to gain as much height as possible and stay in the air for as long as possible. Remember to recover fully between attempts. \\n\\nElbow Drive: 40 meters\\nSprint for 40 meters concentrating on driving your elbow in a straight line. Keep your elbows flexed at right angles while keeping your arms relaxed.\\n\\nSpeed And Agility Drills\\n1. Basic Sprints\\nSet 2 cones out 10-20 meters apart. Sprint from one cone to the next and slowly jog back to the start. Vary the start of the sprint to make the drill more sport specific. \\nFor example... \\nFace backwards, lie down, jump up, pretend to receive a pass, jump to head a ball etc. \\n\\n2. Rolling Start\\nExactly the same as above except you jog for 10 meters before sprinting. This drill is specifically designed to enhance acceleration rather than speed off the mark. Try running backwards or side stepping as well.

Your 6-foot puppy probably is sorry - sorry he got caught, sorry you said "see ya" and sorry that he doesn't have a comfortable place to live.  Take it from someome who let the idiot back 6 - count 'em: 6 times.  Its not like I'm some stupid girl, I am an attorney, I was with him for 10 years and some part of me just thought it would all turn out ok.  It didn't.  Eventually he left me for the same girl that he got involved with 6 months earlier - and of course he was so sorry then - but when she called him telling him she missed him, well what could he say?  So he left me for her.  And somehow I was upset about this - ahh the human mind.  Anyway - your puppy is never going to change.  My new mantra will be - one chance - if I realy realy like you, anything more than that and you're out.  Who knows, maybe it will be less than one chance.  I suggest the same for all women, unless they like the abuse...

I agree as well.  You should list all of them.  Employers want to understand your progression.  If those job are irrelevant to what you are applying for then just put the dates, job title or function, and city, state.  That should be enough to erase any initial doubts about what you did in life before that.  But be prepared to answer any questions about those roles and if they have any bearing on your abilities as an employee or how they shaped you as a person.

infidel (n) - One who rejects a particular dogma or religion.\\n\\nWe are ALL infidels.
Consider that every number after the nth is bounded between x_n and x_(n+1). Therefore, the maximum distance between any two terms after the nth is |x_(n+1) - x_n|, which is 1/(n+1). Since for every ε>0 there exists an n such that 1/(n+1)<ε, this sequence is cauchy.\\n\\nEdit: "Now, to prove a sequence is cauchy, you cannot assume a relationship between m and n (ie m=n+1) because the required inequality abs(xn-xm)<epsilon must hold for ALL n,m>=N"\\n\\nI'm not. I specifically said that _every_ term after the nth is between x_n and x_(n+1). Not that A term after the nth is, that EVERY term is. This is easily proven by induction - first we show that second term after the nth is in the interval [x_n, x_(n+1)] or [x_(n+1), x_n] (x_(n+1) trivially is, since it is an endpoint of the interval), then we suppose that x_(n+m) and x_(n+m+1) are in [x_n, x_(n+1)] or [x_(n+1), x_n], and deduce from this that since x_(n+m+2) lies between x_(n+m) and x_(n+m+1), both of which are already stipulated to lie in [x_n, x_(n+1)] or [x_(n+1), x_n], that x(n+m+2) also lies in that interval. Thus by induction, all terms lie in that interval. The maximum distance between any two numbers in an interval of length L is L, so any two elements after the nth lie closer than 1/(n+1).\\n\\nI had hoped that you would be able to fill in the missing part of the proof yourself (where you show that all elements after the nth lie between x_n and x_(n+1)), on the grounds that it's intuitively obvious, but tedious to prove. What I didn't expect is for you to fail to read the part where I specifically said EVERY term after then nth and instead give me an insulting lecture about definitions I learned four years ago. I'm sorry I treated you like you were an intelligent human being.

While paddling across a lake in Manitoba, Canada with my some, a beaver jumped in the lake from the shore, swam out to the canoe, grabbed the side of it, and looked inside-exactly like he (or she) was looking for something.  Never even looked at us, just around the floor of the canoe-and then let go, and swam back to shore.

There are some BBW who are happy with who they are. Others are not.  But you may not be able to do anything yourself to make them change from not being happy to being happy.\\n\\nI did have one BBW girlfriend in high school who was happy with herself, but it got too serious and, in high school, it just shouldn't be that serious.\\n\\nAs for those who are not happy with their weight, it's like the old light bulb joke: how many psychiatrists does it take to change -- one, but the bulb has to want to change.\\n\\nI think some people like to define themselves by what is wrong with themselves rather by what is right with themselves.  They get comfortable in their "misery" (I'm too fat, I'm too thin, my hair's straight, it's curly, I can't do this, I don't deserve that, ...)\\n\\nFrankly, I like women who are voluptuous rather than  not.  Always have.\\n\\nPoint is that they just have to wake up and smell the coffee and realize what they have in you as a friend or lover.  But, from experience, I don't think there's much you can do to convince them otherwise.  In one relationship, I had to have one foot out the door before they got a clue.\\n\\nIn some cases, I've known people in relationships with BBW where the woman used her weight as a way of controlling the relationship and limiting the intimacy in the relationship.  And these guys loved these women so much that they couldn't or wouldn't leave.  Why loved these women but, well, to be frank, I don't think these women loved their husbands as much as the husbands loved them.\\n\\nSo, maybe the thing is not to try and change the women that you meet to make them happy but instead determine if you can live with them as happy (or unhappy) as they are.  It is possible that people can change, but they have to want to change.  And sometimes the only thing that can jolt someone into change is to not to support their habits, but to let them know that you love them but there obsessing is to the point where you aren't sure they're happy being with you and that it is time to move on for your own sake.  It's not a threat, you have to respect yourself and your needs and happiness and they need to respect themselves and you.  Otherwise it can just be a co-dependent mess.
The main key is found in Acts 21:8  --\\n\\n"On the next day we departed and came to Caesarea, and we entered the house of Philip the EVANGELIST, who was one of the SEVEN, and stayed with him."\\n\\nIn the passage you asked about --Acts 8--  we find Philip sent specifically to declare the good news, that is, to act as an evangelist, calling people to faith.  And that is what happens, and people believe and are baptized.\\n\\n---------\\nThe question is --Was he a "DEACON" ?!\\n\\nThis is not quite as clearcut as many think.  In Acts 6 and 21 he is referred to as one of "the seven".  The word "deacon" never appears! \\n\\nThe reason people have taken to calling these men deacons is the WORK they were given to do, and esp. Peter's statement in Acts 6:2 - "It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables." The word "serve" here is diakonia.  But in fact the Greek words used are often very general "diakonia" = "service" and "diakonos" = "servant".  They do NOT always refer to the more specific "office of deacon" that we find later on (in Paul's epistles).\\n\\nIf you look at how "the seven" where chosen in Acts 6, and their subsequent ministry, it is clear they did more than oversee the "ministry of mercy" or finances associated with the special office of deacon in the church.   Rather, these were known leaders of the Greek-speaking (Jewish) Christian community.  So it's not surprising to find Stephen preaching (Acts 7) and Philip evanglizing (Acts 8).  (For that matter, the picture of Acts as a whole seems to be that PAUL takes up the work of Stephen!)\\n\\nIn fact, the Spirit-filled Seven of Acts 6 strongly echoes an Old Testament story (in Numbers 11) of the Seventy ELDERS of Israel who were given the Spirit to help Moses when the people grumbled about the food!   I'm not saying the Seven should be called "elders", just that "deacons" is not necessarily accurate.

Girls are the future mother and they really love to have the upper hand over someone. If they try to that with other women, it ends in disaster. So they trun to men as they know that we prefer to tolerate a womens nonsense than fighting back.\\nOne thing i want to make clear, i did not mean to insult women. I have many females around me who do the samething. I dont bother and accept them for what they are. And they do know that and they respect me for that  though they hate admit it to my face.

Spedusource gave you some good information. \\n\\nI think if you are trained in speech pathology, that might be where you will best assist the school children with Autism. Many children with Autism have limited verbal language and need much support from a speech-language pathologist. Some techniques that help children with Autism communicate is to use sign language for simple commands (words like "more," "all done," "stop," "help," "please," etc.) or to use pictures. Mayer-Johnson company out of California has great software: Board Maker and Writing with Symbols are two programs I have used in my job. The programs have simple pictures to describe words and activities, and these pictures can be presented to children with Autism in a schedule form, or during Descrete Trial therapy. \\n\\nEach child with Autism is completely different from one another. They may have similar challenges but each child has to be respectively approached. I have found that I can help a child with Autism best once I have spent some time getting to know them.

Yes.   Inflation basically boils down to that money today is worth more than it is tomorrow.  As inflation goes up, the value of the debt decreases.  So you are paying off the same amount of debt, but it is worth less.   That's why when inflation goes up, interest rates go up - to compensate the creditor for the lost value.\\n\\nGenerally, wages go up with the rate of inflation...but the amount of your debt does not.  So while the buying power of a single dollar is less, your total buying power (hopefully) stays the same.  \\n\\nOf course, no one wants hyper inflation.  But it is a great way to get out of debt.
365 days in a year, divided by 12 equals 30.416.  So you make every other month 30 days and the rest 31.  Then you find that there is one left over with 28 days.  What do you do with that month?  You call it February and stick it in the middle of Winter.  :-)

Dreams are a form of subconscious stress relief.  You are either worried that he could some day cheat or leave you, or as much as you feel that you wouldn't cheat on him, you have a hidden wild side that hasn't been explored.

How long it takes? Years and years...just getting the application approved to start the process!

It is also an unfair system. Cubans are all but automatically granted citizenship, while others can't get it no matter what they do. We have serious limits which vary from country to country.

First of all Christians aren't mindless. God doesn't want us to be mindless nor does he want us to have blind faith. He wants us to use our brain and think and question things and make decisions for ourselves. That is why he gave us brains and free will. God wants us to know what we believe and why and as such we must have our eyes wide open in our faith in Him. I have never forced my beliefs on anyone. Jesus has never done that either. He would give His opinion and have His say. Anyone forcing their religion or beliefs on someone is in the wrong. Even a Christian who tries to force their opinion on someone is sinning and needs to stop. Yes I will give my opinion on lots of things, especially when I see someone such as you making the comments or posing a question such as you have, but you are free to believe and think what you want. Yet it seems that most of those who are Anti-Christ and Anti-God want to have their say or make rude comments, but not let the Christians have their say. So now you had your say and I had mine and you can take it or leave it. The choice is now yours. John 3:3-6 and Ephesians 2:8-9
Marijuana actually has many helpful benefits toward diseases / sicknesses. Marijuana can reduce nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite caused by AIDS. It can Reduce interlobular pressure, which alleviates the pain and slowing and sometimes even stopping the progress of glaucoma. Common side effects of chemotherapy are nausea, loss of appetite, and vomiting, all of which marijuana would help. It can limit muscle pain and relieve tremor nad unsteadiness of gait for multiple sclerosis patients. Marijuana can help prevent epileptic seizures in some patients. It can also alleviate chronic, often debilitating pain caused by myriad disorders and injuries. Each one of these applications have been deemed legitimate by at least one United States court, legislature, and/or government agency.

If the satellite dish is digital (little) then you can plug any old sky digital box into it.  Don't pay the subscription, and you'll get access to all the free channels.

I was shy as hell... what helped me get over it is just throwing myself into a situtation where I was forced to confront my fears. For example. I took a speech class in high school where about once a week we had do give a speech in front of the class. Also I volunteered at a nursing home... that doesn't force you to talk infront of a large group but it makes you talk to people from all walks of life. It makes you get used to talking to different people and strangers. Plus with my job that I have now (receptionist) I have to talk to A LOT of people and have to at least act like a people person. I say just throw yourself in their and all will get easier after a few times.\\nPractice makes perfect.

Protons carry a positive electric charge.  Electrons carry a negative electric charge.  The magnitude of the charge carried on both the, positive, protons and the, negative, electrons are equal....meaning that the total electric charge on an object is zero only if the number of protons exactly equals the number of electrons.\\n\\nIn an atom, for example, the net electric charge is zero and there are equal numbers of protons and electrons.  When an atom has an unequal number of protons and electrons (in the case when the atom is oxidized or reduced...loosing electrons or gaining electrons), the atom becomes an ion and has a net charge.\\n\\nIf something does have an unequal balance between protons and electrons and has a net charge, it will be attracted/repelled to other objects with a net charge as well.  Like charges repel and dissimilar charges attract, so all the + charges will attract all the - charges and vice-versa, eventually forming overall neutral objects.

Current popular explanations for the origin of the phrase "graveyard shift" reference the 19th century problem of accidentally burying people who were still alive. To prevent this from happening caskets were equipped with a bell-ringing device enabling a waking "corpse" to notify the world that they were no longer dead (this is also the origin of the term "dead ringer"). The graveyard attendants who remained vigilant throughout the day and night worked the graveyard shift.\\n\\nInteresting, eh?

Ask her about her activities over the 2 or 3 days before, and the day of the shin pains. I went through this with one of my children when she was in elementary school. It took about three months, but I finally spotted a pattern. The school rotated the playground activities on the lunch and recess breaks every week and about once a month the area my daughter played in for a week included the monkey bars. They were her favorite part of the playground equipment and she climbed them constantly during the time allowed. To check my theory that this was the cause, I forbid her to climb them the following month and she didn't develop the shin pains. After that she was more careful not to over extend herself on them (so that I wouldn't take away the privilege again), and all was well. We had the same problem when she got her first bicycle, until her legs got stronger.

Obvious child is right. The reason we don't do that is because Congress has SS money put in the general fund, so it isn't safeguarded from all thier porkbarrel projects.  Convenient apathy.  While I am not a fan of his, Al Gore's famous general idea of a "Social Security Lock Box" points out that problem.  First, we should have 401k's available through a third party, and not controlled by Congress.  This shouldn't be forced, either: If people want to be dumb with thier money and not invest, fine.  But if they did, when they tapped into it at retirement, the economy would boom.  Not only that, but it would be helped out while the 401ks were matureing because how they work is the money is invested in companies, and they grow and pay the investments back with intrest.  Of course this will never work because Congress has been spending way too much for decades, and the general fund has virtually been living off SS money.  So right now not only is YOUR SS money that could be GROWING AND helping the economy (Thats a long term and short term investment all in one) just sitting there, its being spent on other things as well by a congressman you don't like and who someone else elected in a different state.  Oh, by the way, Congressmen don't pay into SS, they have thier own special retirement plans. Show's how much they trust it, doesn't it?

The way that I understand the story of Mary and Joseph goes (and it's been awhile since I've read it) is that she was raised in the church basically and had come of age to be married, which if I remember correctly was 15.  Joseph was an older man, with other children, I don't know if he had other wives, but I know he was married at least once before.\\n\\nJoseph didn't want to marry Mary, is the jist of it.  There was some sort of religious thing where all the men stuck their sticks into the ground and one of them would suddenly grow flowers.  Joseph's staff was the one that "won" the maiden, and he was pretty much forced into marrying her.\\n\\nSo anyway, when they married, there was some reason why he couldn't have relations with her, something about how long the ceremony was, like 21 days or something.  He left the city, and didn't return until well AFTER the 21 days was up.  And she was already pregnant.\\n\\nA lot of what I just told you was taken from the Apocrypha, and like I said, it's been a long time since I've even thought about it.
It looks like an indian name!

when you exercise do so in segments.\\nexercise for 10-30 minutes, then take a break of 10-30 minutes. it gives your body time to completely recover.\\nthen you can exercise some more, then break some more.\\ntry to do a routine of different muscles worked out over time, so that you do not do all the same muscles all the time. try to find a amount of effort that you can put into your training, and then back off 18%-30 precent so that you can do training easy and well do reps. you should not be able to hurt yourself if you take it easy. it may take more time to get into great shape, but you will not have injuries to slow you down getting there. be careful.
People are just responding to this situation negatively because that is what they were taught growing up. Don't worry about it. Just stand by your man and be happy you found someone to love and that loves you back. Pretty soon the world will be all mixed anyway! Good Luck!

Of course. There are many "faster-than-light" proposals considered seriously in contemporary science.

The only things lacking are the energy or scale necessary to make the ideas viable. Keep studying physics and maybe you will be the one to solve these problems.
The same people who invented the wheel five or six thousand years ago (the Mesopotamians) also fancied the number sixty, basing their entire number system on it. No one seems to know exactly why--it might even have been related to trade: for commercial purposes, it's helpful to use a number that has many factors, and sixty has twelve of them, more than any other manageable number.... Whatever the reason, the Babylonians picked the system up and passed it on to the Egyptians, who used it to divide the circle into 360 degrees (6 x 60) and who also gave us the symbol for degrees. The Egyptians divided spheres into 360 degrees as well, assigning the first latitude and longitude lines to the earth. This ancient system for dividing the circle has persisted to the present. Each degree of the circle is divided into 60 minutes (60') and each minute into 60 seconds (60").\\n\\nFor more information about the origin of the system for dividing a circle into 360 degrees see also:\\n\\nBynum, W.

Health care providers, clinicians, and researchers have been debating the potential of antibiotics hindering the effectiveness of oral contraceptives for quite some time. There have been several research studies that concluded that some antibiotics do indeed decrease the effectiveness of the pill. Hence, it becomes more likely that an unintended pregnancy could occur. \\nThe general recommendation when taking antibiotics for a short amount of time is to use an additional backup contraceptive method such as a latex condom during the treatment time and for one week afterward. When taking antibiotics for a long period of time, the general recommendation is to use an additional backup method for the first two weeks of the antibiotic use. \\nIt also is important to remember that you should continue using the pill unless directed otherwise by your health care provider. He/she may provide more specific instructions based on your individual situation, medication, or health status.
Take your time and don't rush this relationship.  Your still young and you need to make sure you are jumping into a situation that won't allow you to continue to grow and be happy in your life.  A man that old with kids has a very settled and projected life.  You have to be sure this is really a life that you want to take on because kids and his life style are big responsibilities.

I voted Republican twice.  Not because I was republican but because the democrats kept doing far left crap with such org's as NAMBLA, or PETA or other far left organizations.

Yes, it may cover most of the bacteria that typically cause oral abcesses.  However, it does not cover what we call "anaerobic organisms".  If you do not feel better after 24-48 hours, or if it gets worse in the next 24 hours, talk to your doctor to get an alternative (clindamycin or augmentin).  Also, septra has a sulfa component, so please do not take it if you have had a severe allergic reaction to sulfa in the past.

It should play in either vcd player and dvd player if it is burnt as VIDEO CD.  I assume you did not burn it to be a VCD, you just picked the video files from your computer and burned them onto the cd right away.  making it a Data CD rather VCD.  VCD has a standard fromat. It has some folders like, CDI, MPEGAV, SEGMENT, VCD, etc. check if your CD contains all these or such folders, if yes, its a VCD and it should run, if no so, then its a simple DATA CD which is not recognizable on VCD/DVD players.

Domestic Violence charges do not just go away like they use to. Even though they can be dropped later by the state the arrested person still will have a criminal history that will show one charge and no conviction. The DA may decide to drop the charges when you go in front of a judge if there is a bad witness or no witness willing to testify. A wife can not be compelled to testify against her husband just because the state decides to prosecute. The spouse needs to contact the agency that is handling the case and the DA or prosecutor that is handling it for the state and I am sure something can be worked out mutually. Domestic violence is frowned upon now and carries stiff sentences so try and avoid domestic violence at all costs.

Hi!  Depends on what type of Leukemia the diagnosis is.  And yes....there are people who are cured of Leukemia!  Some types are more "treatable"....the term remission is usually used for a period following the Leukemia....in most cases after 5 years the Leukemia is considered to be cured if there has been no relapse.  There is a risk of secondary diseases with Leukemia chemotherapy's and other treatments just the same as any type of cancer.  Medicine has come a long way in the treatment of Leukemia in the past 20 years....giving many diagnosed with Leukemia a good second chance at life!!!
Registered Nurse here; First let me share with you, this is not my area of expertise.  However, was the physician you saw a ophthalmologist (eye surgeon)?  If not make an appointment and see a Doctor that specializes in only diseases, and abnormalities of the eye.  Go for a second opinion if the initial physician was a ophthalmologist.  I do believe you can be helped with your eye problem. \\nThanks for the opportunity to address such a important question.
No but some people want someone to talk to.
Actually, Japanese citizens and citizens of Brunei and Singapore do not need visas to go to many countries in Europe and North America.\\n\\nThe reason is simple.  Due to disparate standards of living, without immigration controls, such as visas, large numbers of the population of developing countries would crowd into the countries requiring visas, resulting in high unemployment and an upswing in social problems.  this has been demonstrated in very many cases over the last 100 years.  There was even a time when immigrants from Europe to the US returned to Europe because there were too many of them and they couldn't make a living (Italian to US immigration backflow of the early 20th century).\\n\\nBy imposing a visa regime, the country requiring the visa gets to look at applicants for a visa to determine if they intend to try to become economic refugees (so to speak).  Yes, it is true that many people aren't interested in illegally immigrating, but many are.  When you have almost 10,000,000 people in the country illegally already, it is a strain on the infrastructure in some places.\\n\\nThe countries with visa regimes generally have ways to obtain an immigrant visa to go into their country legally.  this is to limit the number of people to a manageable group.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there aren't a lot of people who are looking to immigrate from the United States or Britain to the Philippines to improve their lives and economic condition.  It is as simple as that.  Once you can demonstrate good ties to your home country (better than average job, property; in other words, the things that make you a credible tourist) you will find it easy to get a visa.  \\n\\nIf you are upset because it is hard to get a visa to go and stay with your cousin in LA fora month and the air ticket price represents two months wages, it is hard to justify yourself as a bonifide tourist (just an example, I don't know your details).

This is actually very easy to answer, based on evolution the egg had to come first. Evolution works like this: There are slight changes in the genetic information of the sex cells (i.e. eggs and sperm) of individuals that are passed on to the offspring of any two parents. These changes in the genetic makeup are called mutations. Mutations can either have: 1) A deleterious effect on the offspring (genetic disorders may arise, many times these are lethal); 2) sometimes these mutations may be advantageous, making an individual more fit than its neighbors (this is sometimes referred to as conferring an advantage); or 3) these mutations can have no effect, making no change from parent to progeny.\\n\\nIn the case of the chicken, it must have evolved from something else that became less fit than the chicken and eventually becoming extinct. The chicken became a chicken from this other organism through mutations that built up over time in subsequent generations. However, whatever the genetic makeup that finally became defined as a chicken, that individual was first conceived and developed in an egg before being hatched. The egg and sperm that fused to produce the chicken didn't bypass the period of gestation within an egg that had developed in the bird family millions of years before the chicken came along.\\n\\nSo the simple answer to this question is the egg came first -- unless you believe in fairy tales?

We do because we use their services and labor. It helps to keep many of our offices clean, fruits and vegetable affordable, lawns mowed, new houses built, Mexican food cheap at the drive-thru after closing hours at the bars, hotel rooms clean, dishes cleared after a nice meal at the fine restaurant, dry our cars after the car wash and many more.\\n\\nIf these jobs were paying more, Americans would work those jobs. Except that if Americans worked those jobs, our laws would cost more to mow, our office rent would increase, hotel rates would increase, washing your car would be $30, our strawberries would be $8 instead of $4.\\n\\nThey are helping to keep things affordable.
I remember a game played in 1977 at Hampden between a Glasgow Select and The Football League. As you have described, the Glasgow jerseys were green and blue stripes and the team consisted of mainly Old Firm players with Kenny Dalglish as captain. Can't remember a match in 1975.

I asked this same question.  My physical education professor at UNCW told me that you are born with a specific number of fat cells and they grow and shrink (as someone has mentioned on here).

Keratins are a family of fibrous structural proteins; tough and insoluble, they form peptide bonds to adjacent protein chains, facilitating their close alignment of the sulfur-containing amino acid cysteine, required for the disulfide bridges that confer additional strength and rigidity by permanent, thermally-stable crosslinking — a role sulfur bridges also play in vulcanized rubber. Human hair is approximately 14% cysteine. The pungent smells of burning hair is due to the sulfur compounds formed. Extensive disulfide bonding contributes to the insolubility of keratins, except in dissociating or reducing agents such as urea.\\n\\nYou could get more information from the link below...

Your assumption is correct:  being legally in a Schengen country will not help your chances of getting a US tourist visa.

I had my tonsils taken out many years ago.  The operation itself wasn't too bad, as you will be put to sleep during the procedure.

In that case, all you need to do is to right click on the person that you want to talk to and click send an instant message.  Hope that helps.

As far as I know there is no such thing as "pharmaceutical grade" for any reagent.  Reagents exist in hundreds of specific and defined 'grades'.  The pharmaceutical industry uses a wide variety of different grades of reagents.  Isopropanol, for example, would probably be used as an 'ACS grade', 'HPLC grade' or 'USP grade'.  The grade required would depend on the specific use or purpose of the reagent.  Is it being used for cleaning?  to dissolve something in solution?  as a reagent in analytical analysis?  As far as I know, there is no general 'pharmaceutical grade.'\\nReagent grades specifically define purity and impurity levels of a given reagent.  There are many many different grades!\\n\\nTry searching "reagent grades" on the Internet to get a better idea of all the different grades available.
A republic is a kind of democracy. Democracy is a wide-reaching term referring to basically any system of government in which the people play a significant part in the running of the government. A pure democracy is one in which every citizen votes on every decision, which is fairly impratical with the size of today's nations. A republic is a representative democracy, meaning people vote for people (president, representative, senator, etc.) to go represent them while actually running the country. This allows people to not spend all of their time voting on every bill, but still gives them control over how it is run, since most elected officials want to be reelected, and also avoid being recalled.

D'Artagnan was named after the little south west france bearing the same name. Artagnan. D'artagan actually means "from Artagnan".\\nYou pronounce it as such:\\nArr\\nTah\\ngnon  (the "an " is almost like the sound UN in "huh?")

You say you have 9.2, but you don't say what kidn of iMac you have.  Is it the original one (the color they called "Bondi Blue")?  If so, I think you would be better off taking the money you would spend on OS X and putting it toward a new iMac.  (Or if you can find a monitor somwhere, a Mac Mini, which is even cheaper.)  If it is a later generation iMac, then you will see a big difference with OS X, assuming you have plenty of RAM--at least 512 K.  But I would not spend the money ($129) on the latest version of the OS, which is 10.4.  You can pick up v. 10.3 for less than half that, if you look at eBay and similar sites.  If you decide to go this route, make sure that your buy a copy that is good for all Macs (not the ones that are given with a particular model).  That way you know it will install on your iMac.  Also, if you install 10.3, go to the Apple Web site and download the free upgrades to take it to 10.3.9.\\n\\nI am writing this on a second-generation G3 iMac, one step newer than the Bondi version, and I am using 10.3.9 But if you can afford it, my main advice is to spend the money on a new computer if your iMac is old.  It is what I will do as soon as I can afford to.\\n\\nGood luck.  Remember, "iMac, therefore I Am." :-)
It's very difficult to get rid of cellulite.  But 2 things that have helped reduce cellulite for me are Avon's anti-cellulite cream and taking tonalin CLA.  Rub the cream on the areas with cellulite twice a day.  Take 2 CLA caplets twice per day.\\n\\nThe other thing is to reduce fat overall by exercising and building muscle.  Running is good... really burns calories and works those legs.  Squats and lunges, too.
A bicycle. The wheels and pedals each form a separate wheel and axle system. The brakes and brake handles are levers, and the seat adjustment is a screw.\\n\\nOther examples are an an axe or a shovel, which are made of a wedge and a lever; a typewriter or piano keyboard, which utilize a system of two or more levers; a pencil sharpener, which is composed of a wedge and a wheel and axle; and pliers or nail clippers, which are both made of multiple levers.

First, I won't go into the legality of downloading movies. There are copyright laws in the US that would make downloading movies a crime. Actually, I don't know if it's the act of DOWNLOADING or the act of UPLOADING or MAKING AVAILABLE that is illegal. I would think the later.\\n\\nAnyway, you can find tons of movies at various BitTorrent sites. I use these as a few to find certain TV shows...\\n\\nhttp://www.torrentspy.com/\\nhttp://isohunt.com/\\nhttp://isohunt.com/\\nhttp://thepiratebay.org/\\n\\nYou'll need a BitTorrent client to download these files.

You've already been told of the physical effects. Now, get a hold of the emotional ones. Someone who dies from the effects of smoking needlessly leaves behind loved ones to mourn. My sister smoked heavily for years, she died 4 years ago and left 3 young adult children who'd already lost their father when they were teens. She now has beautiful grandchildren she will never see. It is slow suicide and is intrusive to others who suffer from asthma and allergies. Second hand smoke is just as dangerous. Just butt out while you still can!

If you mean the South African flag, there officially is no significance attached to the colours. Informally, the consensus seems to be :\\n\\nRed - the blood shed in the country's history. \\nBlue - the sky and the oceans surrounding South Africa. \\nGreen - the land and natural environment of the country. \\nYellow - South Africa's natural resources, represented by gold. \\nBlack - black South Africans and Africa in general\\nWhite - white South Africans as well as peace\\n\\nBlack, Green and Yellow also happen to be the ANC's colours.\\n\\nRed, White and Blue are found on the flags of the UK and the Netherlands, as well as on the old South African flag (Orange instead of Red). Thus the new flag also symbolizes a coming together of the past and the present.

According to the bible the earth is about 6000 years old. Sceintists really don't know how old the earth is.  They guess, and then then present their theories as fact, which is unscientific behavior. They try to use carbon dating but that is not accurate. It also assumes time is linear.  Time is non-linear. Scientists put dinosaurs before man, but there is proof that they co-existed..

Improves Concentration \\nAt work, chewing gum helps us concentrate on the task at hand. Many truck drivers find that chewing gum helps them stay alert at the wheel. \\n\\nEases Tension \\nAs early as 1939, scientific studies showed how chewing reduces muscular tension and helps people feel more at ease. Because it is so well-recognized for helping stay alert at the same time it eases tension, the U.S. Armed Forces have supplied chewing gum to its soldiers ever since World War I. It is still included in field and combat rations today. \\n\\nFreshens Breath \\nChewing gum, especially a mint-flavored gum like Wrigley's Spearmint or Doublemint, moistens and refreshes the mouth and throat and sweetens the breath.  \\n\\nHelps Fight Tooth Decay \\nAfter meals, it isn't always convenient to use a toothbrush. Chewing gum stimulates the production of saliva, which helps neutralize acids from foods that may cause tooth decay.

Sardarji Jokes\\n\\nSmart Sardarji:\\nA Sardarji and an American are seated next to each other on a flight from Los Angeles to New York. The American asks if he would like to play a fun game.\\n\\nThe Sardarji, tired, just wants to take a nap, so he politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks.\\n\\nThe American persists and explains that the game is easy and a lot of fun. He says, "I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me five dollars, and vice versa."\\n\\nAgain, he declines and tries to get some sleep.\\n\\nThe American, now agitated, says, "Okay, if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5,and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500."\\n\\nThis catches the Sardarji's attention and, figuring there will be no end to this torment, agrees to the game.\\n\\nThe American asks the first question: "What's the distance from the earth to the moon?"\\n\\nThe Sardarji doesn't say a word, reaches into his wallet,pulls out a $5.00 bill, and hands it to the American.\\n\\n"Okay," says the American, "your turn".\\n\\nHe asks, "What goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four legs?"\\n\\nThe American, puzzled, takes out his laptop computer & searches all his preferences........no answer. He taps into the air phone with his modem and searches the Internet and the Library of Congress... no answer.\\n\\nFrustrated, he sends e-mails to all his friends and coworkers but to no avail.\\n\\nAfter an hour, he wakes the Sardarji and hands him $500.\\n\\nThe Sardarji thanks him and turns back to get some more sleep.\\n\\nThe American, who is more than a little miffed, stirs the Sardarji and asks, "Well, what's the answer?"\\n\\nWithout a word, the Sardarji reaches into his purse,hands the american $5,and goes back to sleep.

easiest way to transfer cassettes to mp3, is to simply use a stereo to stereo lead from your cassette player and hook directly to your pc, then you can use a sound program (simple voice recorder can do it) and record the sound into a *.wav format (simplest format there is for audio, quite large file), then convert the wav file into mp3\\n\\nnot sure what program to use off top of my head, but i reckon music match would be able to do it
Planets spin because the stuff that fell together gravitationally to make them up had angular momentum relative to the planet's axis. If a meteor comes in and hits the Earth, the chances are nearly zero that it will hit head on. A glancing blow will contribute to the Earth's angular momentum. If a planet or star falls together gravitationally from a cloud of matter, even if the cloud has very little rotational motion, the angular speed of spin is increased as the planet or star becomes more compact. This has to do with the conservation of angular momentum, and a typical example is that of a spinning ice skater pulling in his arms to rotate faster. Another example is the water draining in a sink. It almost always swirls around as it goes down the drain, even if there was very little apparent motion to begin with in the water in the sink.

Hydrocodone is a morphine molecule with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom attached to it. Essentialy it is morphine that has to be demethylized by the liver before it attaches to opiod receptor at base of brain. The body normaly produces it's own morphine, called endomorphins. When a person is taking morphine (of any form) it precludes the need for the body to produce it's own morphine, or endomorphine, so the internal system that produces endomorphines shuts down over time. When this person stops taking morphine, they experiance all the terrible things that morphine, or endomorphine is supposed to regulate - like body temperature, intestinal motion, pain perception, dysphoria...etc, and the only way to "fix" it is to wait until the endomorphine system starts up again (several months to get back to good condition) or to take more morphine. There are treatments, called medicaly assisted therapies, wherein a patient is prescribed either methadone or suboxone to mediate the withdrawel symptoms. Suboxone is the newest. It is butyl morphine and nalaxone in a pill that one dissolves under the tungue. Butyl morphine is a partial agonist with a high affinity for receptors, so it doesn't switch on the recptors as hard as a regular opiod would, but it sticks to the receptors better than a regular opiod would. The nalaxone is a receptor blocker and only becomes bioavailable if the user crushes and injects the pill - in that case the nalaxone would clean the receptors of any and all opiods and the user would experiance full withdrawel symptoms. The net being that the user who takes suboxone doesn't really get high and if they do try to abuse other opiods they will not get any affect from them. There is also a "ceiling affect" with butyl morphine - so if you try to take a lot of it at once to get high, you don't get any additional affect after a certain amount. The addict would take suboxone for 6 months to a year and then taper off by reducing the dose by a half a milligram a week until down to nothing.

dude how can we answer this?
I've personally thought of this question a lot of times, and I've come to the conclusion that the reason for the unwillingness of the west to declare war on the barbaric states in the middle east, is that we are a country of having our cake and eating it too.\\n\\nConsider that in world war two America and it's allies hated those Nazi's, Japs and, well I don't know what my grandpa's generation called the Italians. Meatball huckers perhaps? But back to the point, today it would be impossible to declare outright war on a rogue nation like North Korea, unless they attacked us first. \\n\\nOne of the reasons for that is because of the liberal rule that has gripped our nation for the past 5 decades. Because of that liberal rule many good changes have come: Civil Rights for blacks and other minorities that has almost erased racism from our thoughts. And, I guess, the liberation of women. Unfortunately, the one thing that prevents us from ridding ourselves of the left-wing thought of mind that, war is the worst thing for man-kind, is Political Correctness. Why? because political correctness' change of Englishes lexicon limits our thought.\\n\\nIt is a sad state when many great ideas are broken down because they are deemed politically incorrect or backward. I read a story in my local paper about a school trustee who was forced to resign because of the use of the word, "niggardly" in a briefing letter to other trustees. As many of us know niggardly is a adjective that means sad, or a mopey way of actions. But of course some people thought that this trustee, who had held his job for some time, was a hate monger and didn't deserve the honorable position of school trustee. I don't think I have to explain to you why this is bad for civilization, but to get to my point, and the answer to your question, I will anyways.\\n\\nIf you've ever read George Orwell's book "1984" you many be familiar with "Newspeak", which was the government sanctioned changing of the English language into newspeak. They did that in the book because while speaking English, you could form thoughts against the totalitarian government in "1984". But in Newspeak, it was impossible to form a dissenting thought or as the book calls it, "Thought Crime". I hope as you are reading this you are drawing parallels between "newspeak" and Political correctness, because there are no differences. Political correctness is the Lefts way of limiting our thought and freedom of speech. Consider how mentally disabled people used to be called, "retards" or "Mongoloids" which is just a waste of time, but has been done anyway. The same thing happens in "1984", when in English you could say," all men are equal" but in newspeak you cannot say that. If you did say all men are equal it wouldn't register as all men are equal in freedom, it would mean all men are equal in size. This is a startling comparison to the events of today's world and the Lefts control of our vocabulary.\\n\\nBut now I finally get to my point, we will never be able to declare war on the middle east, and it's most dangerous state, Persia, until we return to the thought of yesteryear, when you could say and do normal, orthodox things without fear of persecution. How do we get to this Utopian state? you get there by ridding ourselves of the cancer of politically correctness. The reason Islam has declared a holy war, or "Jihad" on the west is because they do not have the cancer of political correctness in their way of life. We cannot declare war on them because of the persecution of the liberals if we do. \\n\\nSo, in closing, we will probably never declare war on the middle east. That is unfortunate because the middle east and the Axis of evil consisting of Iran, Iraq and North Korea, is the most dangerous threat to out survival.\\n\\nIf you would like to know more on the dise

FEDERAL - The government of the United States, established by the U.S. Constitution, is a federal republic of individual states. The laws of the United States are contained in Acts of Congress; administrative regulations, and judicial cases interpreting the statutes and regulations. The federal government has three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. Through a system of "checks and balances", each of these branches has some authority to act on its own, some authority to regulate the other two branches, and has some of its authority, in turn, regulated by one or two other branches.\\n\\nSTATE - In general, matters that lie entirely within state borders are the exclusive concern of state governments. These include internal communications; regulations relating to property, industry, business, and public utilities; the state criminal code; and working conditions within the state. Within this context, the federal government requires that state governments must be republican in form and that they adopt no laws that contradict or violate the federal Constitution or the laws and treaties of the United States.\\n\\nLOCAL - Local governments are administrative offices of an area smaller than a state. The term is used to contrast with offices at nation-state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government.

It's not the size of the ship but the motion of the ocean...I know corny but size isn't everything.  I have had partners that were small but were amazing in bed.  If sex is just about penetration to you then you need more practice.  Pleasing your girl is more about the foreplay than just sticking it in.  You should concetrate more on touching her with your hands and lips first.  Explore her with your hands and fingers before you go for it.  If you still feel like she isn't being pleased, ask.  If you are having sex, you should be able to talk about it with her.  Ask her what she likes.
The main key is found in Acts 21:8  --\\n\\n"On the next day we departed and came to Caesarea, and we entered the house of Philip the EVANGELIST, who was one of the SEVEN, and stayed with him."\\n\\nIn the passage you asked about --Acts 8--  we find Philip sent specifically to declare the good news, that is, to act as an evangelist, calling people to faith.  And that is what happens, and people believe and are baptized.\\n\\n---------\\nThe question is --Was he a "DEACON" ?!\\n\\nThis is not quite as clearcut as many think.  In Acts 6 and 21 he is referred to as one of "the seven".  The word "deacon" never appears! \\n\\nThe reason people have taken to calling these men deacons is the WORK they were given to do, and esp. Peter's statement in Acts 6:2 - "It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables." The word "serve" here is diakonia.  But in fact the Greek words used are often very general "diakonia" = "service" and "diakonos" = "servant".  They do NOT always refer to the more specific "office of deacon" that we find later on (in Paul's epistles).\\n\\nIf you look at how "the seven" where chosen in Acts 6, and their subsequent ministry, it is clear they did more than oversee the "ministry of mercy" or finances associated with the special office of deacon in the church.   Rather, these were known leaders of the Greek-speaking (Jewish) Christian community.  So it's not surprising to find Stephen preaching (Acts 7) and Philip evanglizing (Acts 8).  (For that matter, the picture of Acts as a whole seems to be that PAUL takes up the work of Stephen!)\\n\\nIn fact, the Spirit-filled Seven of Acts 6 strongly echoes an Old Testament story (in Numbers 11) of the Seventy ELDERS of Israel who were given the Spirit to help Moses when the people grumbled about the food!   I'm not saying the Seven should be called "elders", just that "deacons" is not necessarily accurate.

You don't say what country you are in.  In America, your Grandmother has the legal right to do what she wants with the property.  If she has made a "Last Will & Testament", then you will find out who gets what AFTER she dies & the will is read to the family.  You are not entitled to any of it, but your parents are & they could contest the will if they feel it is unfair.  You cannot contest it unless you can prove that she gave you something that is not listed in her will.  Get things in writing from her BEFORE she dies OR ask her to give it to you before the family starts to get into a battle.  You sound like a spoiled person who is only interested in getting things away from other Family members who are probably thinking the same way.  That's where you learned it from.  I hope your Grandmother gives it to a deserving person or Charity Organization.  Just because your Father is older doesn't mean he deserves to get everything & neither do you just because you are his child.  This is "Old World Traditional" thinking that is no longer being used in the U.S. because it is DISCRIMINATORY.  It leaves the women out & is illegal & unfair to them.  You should open your eyes, grasshopper.

Since the MCAT is a pre req to med school, and med schools would require a transcript from an undergrad program, the average age of an MCAT taker would be around 20 years old.  However, if you are a genius of any sort and have completed the requirements ahead of the rest of the applicants the age at which you were to apply would be different.  Make sure you have done all the pre-work before even considering it.  Otherwise you will have to take it multiple times... not good!

I would buy special LCD screen cleaner at somewhere like OFfice Depot. I use a special spray with a microfiber cloth, but there are special cloths there also. When you clean the screen, apply as little force as possible to it as pressure can damage the screen.
NNNOOOOOOO!!!!!! dont do it!!! I thought that is was a good idea to sign up because you go at your own pace.  so I researched it a little bit and their website looked legit and they said they were accredited.  So I sent them a check for 5 dollars and they said they would get me started and I would make payments to them every month. After I gave them my check, they asked if they could record my voice saying that I want to join the school.  So I did.  Well, they send me my first semester's materials, and they are like middle school literature.  And they even have books that look like they were photocopied.  So in reading the material, it says that if you don't send them your first exams in a certain amount of time, they will drop you from the school, so I didn't send anything to them for a few months because during this time, I found that they are accredited but the president of their board that does the accredidation, is the president of the school.  They accredited themselves.  Also, there is a difference between regionally accredited and nationally accredited.  I found out that after I had already given them the 5 dollars, that most colleges would not let me transfer credits from ashworth.  Most of the colleges had never even heard of ashworth.  Now Ashworth college is trying to come after me for 9 thousand dollars for the whole semester!! When speaking to others, I was told that this one person did an aerial view of the address and all that was there was a warehouse.  There was no school like there was in the pictures on their website.  The same person who did this, called the college and said he was in the area and he wanted to come by and meet some of the staff and they told him he couldnt There are quite a few people including myself who are interested in opening a class action law suit against the school for fraud and deception.  Please, Please, Please, dont do it!!!
No because he said he would like to win another Premiership title before retiring along with Gary Neville.
try speaking it first in the privacy of your home.  Use a tape recorder to hear yourself, see how you sound.  If there are other ppl who speak english that you know personally try talking to them, ask how them how you are doing.  Let them correct you, its the only you are going to learn.  I am learning dutch and try speaking it at home first with my partner who is fluent.  once I feel i have it down ok i take it outside.  it helps me so thats my suggestion!  good luck!
1.  Learn the rules of the road first and the laws that govern them.\\n2.  Take driving lessons. Study the drivers manual & owner's manual.\\n3.  DRIVE WITH A QUALIFIED SUPERVISOR. Someone who has their licence and drives well.\\n4.  Learn and familarize yourself with the controls of the vehicle, (lights, signals, horn, wipers)\\n5.  Be aware of your surroundings at all times, whether driving forward or reverse. Check mirrors and blind spots frequently.\\n6.  Practise in or around no traffic like an empty parking lot then as you get more experience, intergrate yourself into minimal then regular traffic.\\n7.  Practise precision driving on a small street or empty parking lot. (steering, parallel parking etc.)\\n8.  Learn speed control and emergency procedures (such as firm braking, emergency braking and maneveuring*  and skid recovery) in an large empty parking lot practise if possible.\\n9.  Learn to recognize hazards on the road and avoid them.\\n10. Don't be distracted or drive pre-occupied. Drive with both hands on the wheel.\\n11. WATCH OUT FOR PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLIST\\n12.  Be courteous, and considerate.\\n13. Use your turn signals as need. Signal in advance. Signal when you change lanes, executing a turn, pulling to or from the curb, or any deviation from your lane (such as avoid other cars or cyclist).--don't leave your signal on for 12 blocks or something, cancel it when not in use.\\n14. Familiarize yourself with blindspots and changing lane procedures.\\n15. Learn to time yourself when crossing through an intersection so you do not run a red light! (look for signs that the light will change)\\n\\nFinally don't drive like a maniac or like you own the road!\\n\\n*More skill is required for non ABS equiped vehicles (front wheels will lock causing loss in steering)

Surveying is the mapping of the land surface in three dimensions.  Usually a grid is set up in the area of interest.  A person with a surveying scope measures the distance to a target which the 2nd person in the surveying team is holding at a specific point on the grid.  They determine the distance between the points and the angle of elevation which can be used later to calculate the 3 D position of the point.  The very first point on the survey is the reference point, and all other measurements refer back to that one point.  They continue to take measurements at the intersection of the lines of the grid, and end up plotting these points with computer programs.  \\n\\nRoad surveying, however, may not focus on grid points, but be specific points on the road itself.  They may need to determine where the on ramp precisely intersects the higway, or where bridge pilings are, etc.  These intense feature-driven surveys are usually needed to scope out areas for new construction or modifications to existing construction.\\n\\nTopographical maps are 2 dimensional plots of points with different heights.  If you connect a dot between all the points with the same heights, you can visualize mountains and depressions on a 2D paper, and find out where flood zones are and which way water will flow.  \\n\\nCheck out the USGS for explanations of maps and cartography, etc.  The basics are a linear measuring tape, a surveying scope to determine angles of elevation, and a second person to hold the target.  Hope this helps!!

First of all the Bible does not say thou shalt not kill. It says thou shalt not commit murder, and there is a vast difference. Secondly the same Bible that says thou shalt not commit murder also says whosoever sheds man's blood by man shall his blood be shed. Also the same law that the ten commandments is in teaches clearly the death penalty for murder and several other crimes as well including rape, blasphemy, etc. We Christians don't make up our own religion we follow what the Bible taught. You misquote our Bible, that I don't think you have ever read, and then use your misquote to try and refute us. Read the Bible yourself before you throw it at us.

Not really, men can have children much later in life than women.  Women know they only have a handful of years to have children, so they 'hear their biological clock ticking,' when they are getting close to the age when childbearing becomes difficult or impossible.  Men, on the other hand, can have children basically from puberty into their seventies and even eighties.

Businesses must register with the Secretary of State in your state.  At that time you will have a legally registered company (LLC or Corp, etc).  You can do this yourself, or use an attorney.  In this case you might call the entity ABC Enterprises, LLC.  If you want to conduct business using other names, you must file an assumed name (or D.B.A. doing Business as).  This is sometimes regulated by the state, but usually the county you live in.  Call you county clerks office to check on this.\\n\\nYou could then have several assumed names doing different things, all under the umberall of ABC Enterprises, LLC\\n\\nABC Shipping\\nABC Shopping\\nABC Whatever\\n\\nThis would save you money, as DBA filings are cheap vs LLC filings expensive.
Women have a choice of whether they want to shave their pubic hair or not.  Some women do it as it looks better shaved, others don't shave at all- it is really variable, and not a necessity.  I know some women that do it as they can't stand it, so shave it all off.

It is impossible to achieve moral ends through immoral means. Don't forget, those workers wouldn't have worked at the steel mill if they thought they could have gotten a better job someplace else, so Carnegie et. al. did those men a favor. Ditto for sneaker-making kids in Singapore. Before you go thinking I'm crazy, consider this: from 1750 to 1800(the advent of industrialism in England), the child mortality rate in London dropped 70%. I don't expect you to believe that, I expect you to check the facts yourself. In other words, John Bull saved the lives of many poor people. Isn't it better to work in a loud, dangerous machine shop, than to die of starvation? Also, if it weren't for the factories, there'd be no Labor party. Factory jobs lifted generations of people out of poverty and into the law-making middle class. In this case, the end is a better standard of living, and the means are hard work. Nothing wrong there.
It depends on where you live. If you live near the coast and west of you is an ocean, you have a good chance to have clouds around the setting sun because the water takes longer to cool than the land. In the evenings there is a wind blowing in direction of the ocean when the warm air raises above the water. That is why clouds start to form.
An Oracle Database Administrator holds a key role in keeping the system up and running and hence, whatever business it supports up and running. It is a very technical role. They are typically the ones who move objects (tables, views, triggers, functions...) from one environment to the next (Development-->test-->production). They work closely with developers who write software to read/write/update/delete data to and from the database.  They monitor database size allocations and make adjustments for growth. they determine proper data elements that should be used for indexes so that searches against the database run quickly for customers. There is much more. It is a demanding job and they are often the first ones who are required to 'get the system back up and running' when the database goes nutty. (like when someone accidently submits a wacked out query doing a full table scan.\\na SUN administrator is different than a DBA because they do not focus on the database but they keep the server hardware running that the database runs on. They monitor server performance and deploy other custom written unix or java applications that programmers have developed. they too get involved with 'getting the system back up' when something goes haywire. It is also a very technical role and requires great knowledge of the unix commands and operating system.

Will you be selling something on-line (i.e. retailer) or will it be for information (possibly for a brick and mortar)? \\n\\nIMO an on-line retail site would be more difficult to set up, but it is possible for you to run and host it. I use 'DreamHost' which has the ability to host your site and set up retailer shopping carts. \\n\\nAn Information site will be easy, since all you have to do is create pages telling about your services, and include contact information - either an email or an on line form someone can fill out. \\n\\nAs for hiring someone, that will cost some money to create, design, and host.

Fact.\\n\\nIn 1993 I was driving a clunker of a Ford Fairmont, stopped to get gas, and the car failed to start. The mechanic on site offered to jump-start rhe car by way of the solonoid, and the car took off in reverse straight into traffic. Three guys ran after the car, one got trapped between the open car door and a light post, but they managed to stop the car and pull it back into the station. One of the guys said, "Don't kill the engine", the guy who drove it back up got out and closed the door, and it took off AGAIN only to be stopped by a brand new pick-up truck that still had the dealer's tags on it. The police came out, but couldn't find a law on the books to issue a citation, because nobody was driving the car either time.

Hopkins, Johns, 1795—1873, American financier and philanthropist, founder of Johns Hopkins Univ., b. Anne Arundel co., Md. In 1819 he founded his own commission firm, later known as Hopkins Brothers, and also went into banking. He later had a large part in the growth of the Baltimore & Ohio RR, of which he became a director in 1847. His cognizance of Baltimore's lack of medical facilities in times of epidemic and his own scant education led him to bequeath, a few years before his death, $7 million for the founding of a free hospital and Johns Hopkins Univ.

Ferguson also has, or has certainly had in the past, a precarious relationship with Brian Barwick, the FA's chief executive. Barwick is a Liverpool supporter and when he worked in the BBC's football department Ferguson became convinced that the corporation had an anti-United agenda.

Let me just start by saying I am a messiainc Jew and find this question delightful.  The Talmud states that we are to recite 613 Bruchas a day.  A Brucha is a blessing.  This is kind of what Yeshua Jesus meant by pray without ceasing.  We are to medidtate on the Lord day and night, and to hide his word in our hearts.  The cheif way to do that Jewishly is to hammer into the Word.  The Word is the most important thing that we can read, meditate on and pray for.  I will next talk about first the Jewish way of praying and then will talk about blessings.  Yeshua, Jesus being a good Jew used the Blessings in the Beatitudes on the Mount of Olives.  That is the first part of his sermon on the mount.\\n\\nTefilah: Prayer \\nThe Hebrew word for prayer is tefilah. It is derived from the root Pe-Lamed-Lamed and the word l'hitpalel, meaning to judge oneself. This surprising word origin provides insight into the purpose of Jewish prayer. The most important part of any Jewish prayer, whether it be a prayer of petition, of thanksgiving, of praise of God, or of confession, is the introspection it provides, the moment that we spend looking inside ourselves, seeing our role in the universe and our relationship to God. \\n\\nThe Yiddish word meaning "pray" is "daven," which ultimately comes from the same Latin root as the English word "divine" and emphasizes the One to whom prayer is directed. \\n\\nFor an observant Jew, prayer is not simply something that happens in synagogue once a week (or even three times a day). Prayer an integral part of everyday life. In fact, one of the most important prayers in Judaism, the Birkat Ha-Mazon, is never recited in synagogue! \\n\\nObservant Jews are constantly reminded of God's presence and of our relationship with God, because we are continually praying to Him. Our first thought in the morning, even before we get out of bed, is a prayer thanking God for returning our souls to us. There are prayers to be recited before enjoying any material pleasure, such as eating or wearing new clothes; prayers to recite before performing any mitzvah (commandment), such as washing hands or lighting candles; prayers to recite upon seeing anything unusual, such as a king, a rainbow, or the site of a great tragedy; prayers to recite whenever some good or bad thing happens; and prayers to recite before going to bed at night. All of these prayers are in addition to formal prayer services, which are performed three times a day every weekday and additional times on shabbat and festivals. See Jewish Liturgy. \\n\\nThe Need for Prayer \\nMany people today do not see the need for regular, formal prayer. "I pray when I feel inspired to, when it is meaningful to me," they say. This attitude overlooks two important things: the purpose of prayer, and the need for practice. \\n\\nOne purpose of prayer is to increase your awareness of God in your life and the role that God plays in your life. If you only pray when you feel inspired (that is, when you are already aware of God), then you will not increase your awareness of God. \\n\\nIn addition, if you want to do something well, you have to practice it continually, even when you don't feel like doing it. This is as true of prayer as it is of playing a sport, playing a musical instrument, or writing. The sense of humility and awe of God that is essential to proper prayer does not come easily to modern man, and will not simply come to you when you feel the need to pray. If you wait until inspiration strikes, you will not have the skills you need to pray effectively. Before I started praying regularly, I found that when I wanted to pray, I didn't know how. I didn't know what to say, or how to say it, or how to establish the proper frame of mind. If you pray regularly, you will learn how to express yourself in prayer. \\n\\nKavanah: The Mindset for Prayer \\nWhen you say the same prayers day after day, you might expect that the prayers would become rout
United States of America\\nThe martial law concept in the U.S. is closely tied with the Writ of habeas corpus, which is in essence the right to a hearing on lawful imprisonment, or more broadly, the supervision of law enforcement by the judiciary. The ability to suspend habeas corpus is often equated with martial law. Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution states, "The privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it."\\n\\nIn United States law, martial law is limited by several court decisions that were handed down between the American Civil War and World War II. In Ex Parte Milligan 71 US 2 1866, the Supreme Court of the United States held that martial law could not be instituted within the United States when its civilian courts are in operation. In 1878, Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids military involvement in domestic law enforcement without congressional approval. The National Guard is an exception, since unless federalized, they are under the control of state governors. [5]

I have been a pump user since 1995 and have used all the above.  I favor the silhouette infusion set personally because it lies more flush against the skin and doesn't catch and possibly snag on clothing like the quick release.  Also, I don't particularly care for the use of poly-skin dressing as it tends to irritate the skin.  The silhouette can be quickly released, leaving only the infusion set flush against the skin surface and they come with stopper clips for bathing, but aren't really necessary.  I would cleanse it with an alcohol swab anyway for sterilization though.\\nBest of luck and I hope your choice works best for you...it's really a matter of personal preference really.\\nBTW, you may find more information on these items at www.minimed.com   Also, the new 722 is awesome as it has a bolus wizard and is compatible with the Guardian Real Time continuous glucose monitor. It communicates glucose readings directly with your pump and alarms when your glucose levels are too high or too low.  There is good information on this at the mini med website.  Again, much luck to you...live long and live healthy.

Although sailors from the hastily-despatched HMS Britomart proclaimed British sovereignty over the South Island at Akaroa in 1840, the area was settled that same year by French settlers who had intended to establish a colony. The area still has a French influence, reflected in many local placenames.\\n\\nThe French settlement was known as Port Louis-Philipe; before 1840 it was also known as Wangaloa. The name Akaroa is Kāi Tahu Māori for 'Long Harbour'.

Force = mass times weight.  On earth the mass is constant, because the gravitational pull is constant.\\n\\nSo the amount of force needed to move an object that is at rest, depends upon the mass.  In other words the heavier the object, the more force needed begin motion.\\n\\nHOWEVER!.....there is one more factor that is neglected by the above equation.  Newton, tended to do that, most of his laws only apply in a vacuum and on frictionless condition.\\n\\nThat other factor is the coefficient or friction.\\nOn ice its low...and take less force to set an object into motion.\\nOn sand paper the coefficient is high!\\n\\nRECAP!\\nHeavier objects on rougher (higher coefficient of friction) surfaces are more difficult to set into motion.\\n\\nGOOD LUCK!

The heated sands warms up their overhead air, causing the reflection factor of it to be different from upper layers which is much colder. Therefore, the low-angle light rays (e.g. 10 to 20 degrees to horizon) may reflect horizontally or with a slight up-angle and reaches the eyes. Now, what our brain may imagine by this signal is a decisive image: human used to see the sky in the water, therefore if he/she sees these light rays then thinks that there is a water next to horizon which reflects back the sky light-rays.

The Akosombo Dam is a hydroelectric dam in southeastern Ghana. The dam created the largest man-made lake, known as Lake Volta. The dam provides electricity to Ghana and surrounding West African countries.\\n\\n\\nThe dam is 660 meters wide and 114 meters high. It was built between 1961 and 1965. In periods of drought, the water in Lake Volta is rationed and less electricity is generated. During these times, cities in Ghana are subjected to rolling blackouts to lessen their consumption of electricity. Ghana's Volta River Authority has contracts with neighbouring countries for electricity. These contracts are given higher priority than the customers in Ghana's own cities. Though Kaiser Aluminum is a major user, and the dam was constructed in part for the smelting of local bauxite, the economics have turned out such that raw materials have to be imported to keep the industry running.

According to sites in our Texas category, the name of Texas comes from the Indian words "teysha" or "tejas." These words mean either "hello friend" or "friendly" -- which makes sense, because Texans can be very friendly people! Early in Texas history, people from this area were called "Texians." Did you know that six different flags have flown over Texas in its history? First Spain, then France, Mexico, the Confederacy, and the Republic of Texas each ruled the region before Texas became part of the United States in 1845. Yee-haw!

Minerals are natural compounds formed through geological processes. The term "mineral" encompasses not only the material's chemical composition, but also the mineral's structure. Minerals range in composition from pure elements and simple salts to very complex silicates with thousands of known forms (organic compounds are excluded). The study of minerals is called mineralogy. To be classified as a "true" mineral, a substance must be a solid and have a crystal structure. It must also be an inorganic, naturally-occurring, homogeneous substance with a defined chemical composition.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNatural resources are naturally occurring substances that are considered valuable in their relatively unmodified (natural) form. A commodity is generally considered a natural resource when the primary activities associated with it are extraction and purification, as opposed to creation. Thus, mining, petroleum extraction, fishing, and forestry are generally considered natural-resource industries, while agriculture is not. Natural resources are often classified into renewable and non-renewable resources.

It is a serious problem, and, as others have said, the teachers are a large part of that problem, not the solution that they should be.\\n\\nMy grandson brought home a handout from his Language Arts class (see - they don't even hide that they're not teaching English). It was rife with spelling and punctuation errors, total lack of parallelism, and incomprehensible composition. My  favorite part was the paragraph that contained three references to missed work - once it was "makeup", then "make up", and just to cover all bases "make-up". A very close second was a statement that the teacher expected common curtsey. At first I thought she wanted them to bow to her - then I realized she messed up "courtesy" so badly the spellchecker never missed a beat. \\n\\nDid a proofreading job and sent to the Superintendent of Schools.

Well I have.  I have known them since 2 and 4.  They spent weekends and holidays with us.  Half way through the 3rd and 5th grades they came to live with us.  They had little or no rules where they were at.  Their Mom left them, they were hurt, and angry.  I just happened to be the one there to take those emotions out on.  They did not like rules, and would call their Mom's and my Husband's family to complain about how they were being treated, and then the Families always tried to interfere.  What am I saying they did interfere.  Their Mom liked to call My Husband Often to see how they were doing, and Oh yeah I'm not their Mom, even though I was  introduced to their Friends and Teachers as such.  Their Dad unpunished them, when they were in trouble, while My Son stayed grounded.  They were mouthy, to an extent, grouchy, snappy, and would go to great lengths to make My life miserable, in between some good times.\\n\\nThe good news is that was years ago, and they love me dearly, Celebrate Me on Mothers Day, and we have a very close bond.

paste special lets you choose what of the cell you want to paste.\\n\\nfor example, if you have a formula that's calculating averages, and you want to move the answer to a second location, if you do "regular" cut and paste, then the formula will update to the new location, giving you a screwy value.  but with "paste special" you can copy just the value of the cell to the new location.  this also lets you copy just the borders, formatting, comments, formulas, or any number of cool things.  i've personally found it most helpful in dealing with formulas and borders, but there's probably a gazillion other applications.

When they all left, Osama walked up to God and asked, "Hey, what's going on here, I thought..."

In Rooster and Dog compability\\nThis is not one of the most-favored unions. While you may gain, Rooster, because the Dog is a loyal and loving partner, you worry the Dog to Death with some of your daring maneuvers. Suddenly, you both find it difficult to relax together. You tend peck, and your mate growls and snaps in defense, when you disagree. If you have similar goals, you can gain financially. \\nwhile in libra pises compability\\nThese two Signs together combine their heads and their hearts to solve all problems -- a winning combination. The best decisions are made with both the emotions and the intellect; this relationship tends to be extremely flexible and progressive. When problems occur, however, the communication breaks down between Libra and Pisces. Libra, who can at times be mentally manipulative, may give Pisces ""the silent treatment."" In this partnership there's always an undercurrent of friction but neither partner will ever truly be the leader. Although they may disagree often, their differences of opinion don't last long. Their only real trouble may result from their tendency to slow down to the point of stopping when they get together.

Dolphins have hair at one point in their life. When they are born, dolphins have whiskers on their rostrum. A dolphin’s whiskers are about one quarter inch long, and will fall out shortly after birth, as a result of water pressure. Even so, the follicular pits remain open. One can see these follicular pits on the rostrum of any dolphin. They probably serve some sort of sensory function, like the detection of speed or current. Some great whales and one type of river dolphin retain whiskers their entire lives.

When a fuel assembly has been used in a power plant, the assembly is replaced and the old one stored under water in special ponds, or in dry concrete structures or casks.  Here, shielded from people, it is allowed to cool.\\n\\nAfter being sufficiently cooled, the assembly, along with others, is put into a cask for temporary storage on the nuclear power plant site.  Delaying the final disposal of high-level waste also allows its radioactivity to decay.  Forty years after removal from the reactor, less than one thousandth of its initial radioactivity remains, and it is much easier to handle.\\n\\nThe ultimate disposal of vitrified wastes, or of spent fuel assemblies without reprocessing, requires their isolation from the environment for long periods.  The most favored method is burial in dry, stable geological formations up to 600 m or more deep.  Several countries are investigating sites that would be technically and publicly acceptable.\\n\\nThe U.S. considered a number of options for high-level waste disposal, and decided that mined geologic disposal offered the best option for isolation, although research on transmutation of long-lived radionuclides is continuing.  Transmutation involving neutron bombardment has the theoretical possibility of removing isotopes that are radioactive for a long time, thus alleviating disposal issues.\\n\\nThe plan is that the fuel will eventually be placed in the geologic deep-level repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.  This is a mountain of "tuff" -- stable volcanic rock.  This site was selected after years of investigation into other rock forms including granite, layered-salt, salt domes, and basalt.  All had advantages and all would have provided satisfactory final disposal for high level wastes.  The selection of the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada was an expeditious choice based upon the political realities of the day.\\n\\nThe repository deep in Yucca Mountain will consist of a large number of tunnels or corridors into which the spent fuel will be placed, in the form of fuel rods.  These rods will be sealed in heavy casks of steel, and placed in the mined caverns, which are then sealed with bentonite (a clay that forms a secure seal).  The pictures below show what the repository could look like.\\n\\nArtist's conception of repository underground facilities and operations\\n\\nArtist's conception of repository facilities\\nHowever, Regulatory bodies have not yet formally approved Yucca Mountain as a high-level waste repository.  Also, Congress has not adequately funded the work, even though all necessary funds have already been collected in the Nuclear Waste Fund as a surcharge on the use of electricity (at 0.1 cent per kWh - for a total of $16 billion).  So, in the meantime, used fuel assemblies are stored temporarily at the power plants in water pools or large dry casks cooled by natural convection.\\n\\n\\nTransuranic Waste\\n\\nWastes arising from weapons production in the Cold War have their own repository at the Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP) in New Mexico.  This is a repository constructed in layered salt formations and it is been in operation since late 1999, accepting wastes from Government weapons production sites.  The wastes stored there are presently mainly transuranic wastes.  This waste has no connection with commercial electricity generation from the nuclear option.

Ultimately it was the hurricane of course. But a closer look does show that the poor construction and upkeep of the Levey's contributed to the disaster. There was so much political infighting in the region prior to Katrina that the little folks in NO had no chance. There were postponement of inspections of the Leveys due to complacency, and poor planing by the city, state, and federal governments all contributed to the tragedy. NO is a study in governmental idiocy on all levels.

And unlike high school, College is not some mandatory thing you have to go to (or, conversely, are entitled to) and the reviewers know it.  The top schools are looking for kids who will work their butts off, who have a proven record of working their butts off, and who will continue to work their butts off to make the world a better place in the future.  Who really has the potential to be the next leaders?  Who will use school for what it is - a stepping stone to greatness - rather than an end in itself?  \\n\\nIf you take the attitude school is an end in itself, not part of a greater future, you diminish your chances.
You can't! Just face your fears and do it I say!

If you're using windows, the command prompt is very powerful and useful.  I assume that the 3 instances of "title" in your example represent 3 different names, right?  And that they all have the .mp3 extension, right? For a test, copy a few of the files to a new folder, open a command prompt window, and CD to that folder. \\nOpen a text editor and type or copy/paste the following: \\n@echo off\\nif "%1"=="" goto main\\nren "%1 %2" %2\\ngoto  exit\\n:main\\nfor %%i in ("?? *.mp3") do call %0 %%i \\n:exit\\n\\nNote there is a space between ("?? and *.mp3").\\nSave the text as temp.bat in the new folder.\\nIn the command prompt window, type "temp.bat" (no quotes) and hit enter.\\nThis should rename any file in that folder whose name begins with 2 characters and a space; the new name should be the same with the initial two characters and space removed.\\nIf this works you can CD to the folder containing all the files to be renamed, copy temp.bat to that folder and repeat the execution of temp.bat.

New Jersey is very strict with their real estate laws.  Commissions can only be collected by a licensed real estate agent.  Technically an attorney who is a licensed real estate agent can accept a commission.  If they are acting as a lawyer AND real estate agent on the same deal it might create a conflict of interests, by not representing their client's needs to the fullest.  This might be a problem with the New Jersey Real Estate Commission.

Be REAL BRAVE one time when you are together and lean over to offer him a kiss.  Wrap your hands around his face and seal the deal.  If he liked you, there will no longer be any question.  If he wasn't sure, the decision will be clear.  If he didn't like you, he would back off and ask what this is all about.  He may even sound upset at this.  In any case, you will have acted on your desire, and your intentions will set the pace of the relationship.  If both of you are fumbling and blushing when you are together than I would think you both like the other, but both of you are unsure of the others feeling.  Give this a shot.  Good luck and best wishes.

Although He said 70 X 7, He meant that we are to continually live in forgiveness.  It means we are to see others who hurt us as victims of Satan, not just as people out to get us ...

Evidently you have been nurturing this on for some time... even prior to breaking up with your three year fling... It sounds like you want it to happen... Is he aware that you are free to date now... unattached...? If he is, I would do nothing and see if he asks you out in a week or so... if he doesn't, he's just a good office friend with no romantic interest... Some people don't like dating fellow office workers... It's a definite no no... especially when disagreements arise in your private life... I would change my focus and look elsewhere... You are pretty enough to attract a variety of eligible men... so don't worry about that... Just work on that sparkling personality...

Bad Day by Daniel Powter. I discovered this song nearly a year ago and have been infatuated with it ever since. I actually was one of the first people to hear of him in America because he was HUGE in France and I decided to have a listen. It really is a great song and I highly recommend the album. It's titled Daniel Powter and was released in 2005.

Sir Peter B. Medawar, OM, FRS (1915--1987). British immunologist of Arab extraction (which, as he said in Memoir of a Thinking Radish, makes him sound like a kind of gum). Won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1960 for work on tissue transplantation which eventually helped make organ transplants possible. In addition, he wrote extensively, and extremely well, on science and philosophy. \\n\\nPeter Brian Medawar was born on February 28, 1915, in Rio de Janeiro. He is the son of a business man who is a naturalized British subject, born in the Lebanon.\\n\\nMedawar was educated at Marlborough College, England, where he went in 1928. Leaving this College in 1932, he went to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study zoology under Professor J. Z. Young. After taking his bachelor's degree at Oxford, Medawar worked for a time at Sir Howard Florey's School of Pathology at Oxford and there became interested in research in fields of biology that are related to medicine.\\n\\nIn 1935 he was appointed Christopher Welch Scholar and Senior Demonstrator at Magdalen College, Oxford, and in 1938 he became, by examination, a Fellow of Magdalen College. In 1942 he was Rolleston Prizeman and in 1944 he became Senior Research Fellow of St John's College, Oxford, and University Demonstrator in zoology and comparative anatomy. In 1946 he was elected a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and in 1947 he was appointed Mason Professor of Zoology at the University of Birmingham. In 1951 he moved to London as Jodrell Professor of Zoology at University College, London. Here he remained until 1962, when he was appointed Director of the National Institute for Medical Research, London.\\n\\nMedawar's earlier research, done at Oxford, was on tissue culture, the regeneration of peripheral nerves and the mathematical analysis of the changes of shape of organisms that occur during this development. During the early stages of the Second World War he was asked by the Medical Research Council to investigate why it is that skin taken from one human being will not form a permanent graft on the skin of another person, and this work enabled him to establish theorems of transplantation immunity which formed the basis of his further work on this subject. When he moved to Birmingham in 1947 he continued to work on it, in collaboration with R. Billingham, and together they studied there problems of pigmentation and skin grafting in cattle, and the use of skin grafting to distinguish between monozygotic and dizygotic twins in cattle. In this work they took into consideration the work of R. D. Owen and concluded that the phenomenon that they called «actively acquired tolerance» of homografts could be artificially reproduced. For this earlier work on transplantation and growth, Medawar was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, London. When he moved to London in 1951, Medawar continued to work with R. Billingham and L. Brent, on this phenomenon of tolerance, and his detailed analysis of it occupied him for several years. He also carried out other researches into transplantation immunity.\\n\\nThe Royal Society of London, where he was the Croonian Lecturer in 1958, awarded him the Royal Medal in 1959. In the same year, he was Reith Lecturer for the British Broadcasting Corporation. He has been elected a Foreign Member of the New York Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.\\n\\nIn 1937 Medawar married Jean Shinglewood Taylor, daughter of a Cambridge physician. They have two sons, Charles and Alexander, and two daughters, Caroline and Louise.\\n\\nFrom Nobel Lectures, Physiology or Medicine 1942-1962, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1964 \\n\\nThis autobiography/biography was written at the time of the award and later published in the book series Les Prix Nobel/Nobel Lectures.

Think about what you really want to do and have your resume at the top indicate what you want to do. Don't submit a resume that says you want an interesting job and leave it to the employer to decide where to put you. He or she will drop your resume in the garbage. You need a sentence like you want to find a sales job where you can use your strong interpersonal skills for example. Most people get their jobs from people they know so talk to people you know and let them know you are looking for work. You can also get the telephone book and call places you would like to work. For example, if you want to do mortgages, go to the yellow pages and call mortgage companies and get the name of the person to fax or mail your resume to.

Larsson started his professional career playing for Högaborg at the age of 17. He subsequently played for Helsingborgs IF and Feyenoord. Although he was finalising the details of the contract with Grasshopper-Club Zürich in 1993 he moved to Feyenoord for £295,000. Following a complicated contract dispute with Feyenoord, he was signed by Celtic manager Wim Jansen in July 1997 for a fee of £650,000. His debut against Hibernian at Easter Road was less than spectacular: he inadvertently passed the ball to Hibs player, Chic Charnley, resulting in a 2 - 1 loss for Celtic. He didn't fare much better in his first European game, scoring an own goal, although Celtic did run out 6 - 2 winners.\\n\\nHe is apparently going to finish his long career at Helsingborg.

The present administration has made a point of campaigning against poverty. President Lula has recieved international applause for his 'Fome Zero' ('Zero Hunger') program.\\n\\nResearch shows that poverty has decreased 8%, but Brazil still is one of the leaders in the social disparity ranking. We have some of the richest people in the world and quite a lot of the poorest (25,08% of the population lives under the poverty line, which means that their families make under 60 dollars a month).\\n\\nThe current administration spent over US$13.5 billion in the Fome Zero program this year alone, and that number is growing. There's also Bolsa Familia - a program directed at people whose families make under US$50 a month -, which was classified by The Economist as the largest income transfer program in Latin America, with investments that total over US$3 billion. \\n\\nAs far as children go, specifically, there's not a lot being done. Our social services have taken care of 1.69 million children, but they only cover about 80% of all counties. \\n\\nThe problem in the big cities is that most of the poor children that circulate on the streets are not actually homeless. Most of them are sent to beg by their own parents, and some are blatantly used by them to attract sympathy. The mayor of Rio de Janeiro has made attempts at gathering 'homeless' kids in special shelters, but they either escape or their parents take them out and let them go to the streets again.\\n\\nStreet kids are victim of a number of social problems. It is impossible to solve the situation with one specific government program. \\n\\nPS: to the answer before mine: dude, when you say it's a corrupt society, it sounds like everyone is corrupt. That's not a nice thing to say now, is it?

It's possible that it might be okay, but not nearly as creapy or well produced as any of the games.  For example, even though I loved the "Resident Evil" movie, it wasn't the best movie ever made.  And even so, for every "Resident Evil" movie that Hollywood makes, it seems there's about a dozen like "House of the Dead".  \\nSo, I would remain cautiously optimistic, but don't get your hopes too high.
Sure, just be careful.  But you should be careful no matter where you meet someone.  You have just as much of a chance of meeting a serial killer on-line as you do in a bar...  I met my husband online and he isn't a serial killer, at least not that I know of :)
I felt sad reading your question. But you have not given any details but I would just go through it with you, if you dont mind ? Your family isnt 'here' ? You mean you dont have a family, or is it that your family isnt with you at this point of time, probably living in another place ? You have disabilities, like bad hearing, right ? You have not mentioned what other ''disabilities'' you are referring to, but I am sure you are really feeling low due to that. Your eyesight is low, and you do not speak normally.....and to top it all you think of suicide ? \\n\\nIts the last part of your question that you have to read once more yourself. ''why should god let you live here, ....'' Thought why ? I wouldnt want to preach you, cos' when you really feel low and down, you really wouldnt be interested to listen to someone preach you on god, and how to live. But there is one thing for sure, that obviously there are some things left for you to do, while you are here. You may have less of certain things in life, but you have it anyway. There are people who have nothing, in terms of health that you are referring to, and they still struggle day in and day out. You are young, and you still have a long way to go before you say ''I am tired''. You possibly could make things better while you have time. Have you ever thought of a counsellor, participating in activities that you are good at, involve yourself with people of your age, who may be having difficulties, just like you ? Making freinds, is a good option too. Your emotional situation right now is not to socialise, but just give it a try, and then say you cant. \\n\\nHave you considered all your options, and the time god has given you to make things better ? Obviously you are healthy, you were healthy enough to type this question here on yahoo answers, werent you ? And coming back to your question, ''God let you live here, and you have no idea...'''.. I am sure you want to stick around and find out why, would be a good idea, dont you think ? And let me know too, on what you found ?\\n\\nI dont know if you have heard this before, I liked this one which keeps coming in one of those annoying forwards -\\n\\n""It's not whether you get knocked down, it's whether you get back up. - Vince Lombardi''''\\n\\nI feel thats soo true. So, cheer up, and get yourself going. The first instance would be to sum up and mentally make a note of ''All the things I have and I can do"", and then the next step would be to overcome each disability by doing something alternative, winning through it, and not let that disability to rule your life or control your emotions. Right now, you are doing just that. It wouldnt be a quick change, but it will change. This will pass too, and you will begin to see things better. I just hope you do. However, it would be a shame if you cannot say ''Yes, I tried, and I survived it''. \\n\\ngood luck.

People are susceptible because people are afraid. Just like everything else in life, they are afraid of their bodies, their minds, their thoughts. When we grow up and realize that we don't have an infinite amount of time of this planet, people turn to what they have been taught. That there is a better life after death but you have to follow a path to get there. Therefore religion steps in and tries to turn your fear of death to faith instead giving hope. However, no one really knows what happens after we die so its a crap shoot.

Here's the issue:  The finite mind has no hope of apprehending the infinite.  We can define space "\\n\\nMathematics. A set of elements or points satisfying specified geometric postulates: non-Euclidean space. \\nThe infinite extension of the three-dimensional region in which all matter exists. \\n\\nThe expanse in which the solar system, stars, and galaxies exist; the universe. \\nThe region of this expanse beyond Earth's atmosphere. \\n\\nAn extent or expanse of a surface or three-dimensional area: Water covered a large space at the end of the valley. \\nA blank or empty area: the spaces between words. \\nAn area provided for a particular purpose: a parking space. \\nReserved or available accommodation on a public transportation vehicle. \\n\\nA period or interval of time. \\nA little while: Let's rest for a space. \\nSufficient freedom from external pressure to develop or explore one's needs, interests, and individuality: “The need for personal space inevitably asserts itself” (Maggie Scarf). \\nMusic. One of the intervals between the lines of a staff. \\nPrinting. One of the blank pieces of type or other means used for separating words or characters. \\nOne of the intervals during the telegraphic transmission of a message when the key is open or not in contact. \\nBlank sections in printed material or broadcast time available for use by advertisers."\\n\\nThis is a defineable term because the finite mind percieves it as a finite entity with physical properties.  Space has a potential to either be filled or be empty.  Infinity cannot be bounded thus because it is unboundable and therefor indefineable.  If you were to ask is the universe infinite one could only, thoughtfully, respond "No".  This conclusion will be arrived at when the respondant considers that the universe has a definition applied to it and therefore a value that can be discussed and modeled.  You can discuss what is out side the universe, when the universe was created, etc.  Not so with infinity.  Infinity, as best I can discuss it (which is not very well as I am a finite being), is simultaneously all things existing and all things never existing.  The base problem with my definition is that "things" and "existence" are finite concepts fitting within the bounds of perception.  Infinity must be something other than that.  Are you beginning to see the issues with a discussion of infinity?  Try this one, "Infinity is all unthings non-existing".  that's the closest I can get.  Give it a shot.  But recognize that anything within the perceivable physical reality isn't infinite.

It shouldn't be the government that does this.  I am an Economics major, and spent a semester studying Environmental Economics.  The solution can, will, and should come from the private sector.  There are many companies out there researching alternate sources of energy, and when it becomes more economical to use these new advances in technology, the market will use them.  Right now it is too cost prohibitive to use alternate forms of energy, but as other resources become more scarce, the price of them will go up, and we as a society will use alternate forms of energy, all without having to get the government involved.

Her's the LONG ANSWER. Don't read on if you have a limited attention span...\\n\\nMost Liberals don't hate America. Some do no doubt. What I think is that when some consevative talking head comes on the tube and says Liberals are baaaaad!!!!, many people swallow it. There are many impressionable people in this country who are DAMN mad and want to quench the bloodlust generated by the 9/11 attack. Capitalizing on this wave of patriotic zeal the hard core neo-cons (which are not the same as average Republicans) manipulated the entire post attack national conversation. They saw this national tragedy as a way to implement a broad and radical shift in U.S. foreign policy. The Neo-Cons were able to do this because nobody, Republican or Democrat had the balls to stand up to this radiacalism in the shadow of 9/11. The small govornment, fiscaly responsible Republicans have watched in disbelief as our budgetary spending has gone where no tax and spend Liberal ever dared take it. Inflating the budget wouldn't be so bad if it went to sensible programs for security and to update ifrastructure.But instead it is being used as thank you money in the form of "pork barrel " spending around the country, into the districts of those congressman and senators who vote in favor of the Neo-Con agenda.\\n The term Liberal is batted around so much it's funny. What the traditional notion is referring to is a tax and spend agenda. Giving poor and underprivelaged people breaks and assistance in a multitude of areas, thus taking money from the people who earn money. These Liberals are actually really angry with the current administration for the way it uses tax breaks for the wealthy. Then using the budgetary process gives more money to the wealthy via the industrial war production inflated by the war on terror. Then it gives  no-bid contracts to companies such as KBR (Haliburten) and others connected to the Neo-Con teat.\\nWhat you have is a giant spending machine where the profits keep returning to the same people. This notion has yet to sink in with most republicans. They are still too enraged by 9/11 to open their eyes to what is happening. They are being manipulated to cast out the Liberals with all of their uppity talk of Constitutional law and limited Executive power. Those aren't sexy ideas to think about and for this reason most of the ranting conservatives simply roll their eyes and shake their heads,and proclaim "We should pitty those poor deluded Liberals".\\nWell one day (or not) the rest of the country will wake up and join the Liberals. The old fasion Reagan Conservatives will wake up the quickest. They'll wonder why G.W. hasn't seen fit to put an end to the orgy of spending. Why would we mortgage our future so a handful of companys can prosper in the near-term? That doesn't seem like conservativism. The very reason for anti-Liberal angst (out of controll spending) is the lifeblood of the current administration. Only this time the poor don't see the benefits. It is the mega-corporations getting our tax dollars without the oversight of the Congressional Budget Oversight Commitee.\\nIt all boils down to this: Aside from their left wing social views, Liberals are actually doing the work of the minority in any democracy. They are trying to balance the impulse of the current leadership to gorge on as much money and power as they can before their time is up.\\nThe rhetoric is so amusing. Those stupid Liberals. When will they ever learn? It seems our job as citizens isn't to think for ouselves but is to regurgitate the meaningless and empty words of our righteous benefactors the Neo-Conservative puppet masters. All of you Liberals and Conservatives should be thinking for youselves. It is a pity there are so many uneducated people in this country who speak so loudly. They try to convince the masses that it is better not to be "smart". "You don't want to be like those elitist

Zero is neither plural nor singular. It expresses nullity (Hence, it is not singular because it's not 1; Nor it is plural since it's not at least 2). Saying "There are 0 comments" or "There is 0 comment" are both syntactically correct. In both sentences, 0 (zero) is just a qualifier of comment/comments, specifically as an adjective.

God. (cheating) This explanation is what everyone eventually resorts to when the other answers fail. Now, before I go any further, I should make clear that I'm not talking about any of the gods defined in various religions. Throughout all of human history, we've been trying to explain existence. But nobody has ever succeeded. And it's likely that nobody ever will. So we create the concept of God, whose only necessary property is being "that which explains existence." \\n\\nThis doesn't tell us much about god, though. It doesn't mean that any particular religion is correct. It merely defines god as something which answers The Question, because we have not been able to.
The lithosphere (from the Greek for "rocky" sphere) is the solid outermost shell of a rocky planet. On the Earth, the lithosphere includes the crust and the uppermost layer of the mantle (the upper mantle or lower lithosphere) which is joined to the crust.\\n\\nAs the cooling surface layer of the Earth's convection system, the lithosphere thickens over time. It is fragmented into relatively strong pieces, called tectonic plates (shown in the picture), which move independently relative to one another. This movement of lithospheric plates is described as plate tectonics.\\n\\nThe distinguishing characteristic of the lithosphere is not composition, but its flow properties. Under the influence of the low-intensity, long-term stresses that drive plate tectonic motions, the lithosphere responds essentially as a rigid shell and thus deforms primarily through brittle failure, whereas the asthenosphere (the layer of the mantle below the lithosphere) is heat-softened and accommodates strain through plastic deformation. Both the crust and upper mantle float on the more plastic asthenosphere. The crust is distinguished from the upper mantle by the change in chemical composition that takes place at the Moho discontinuity.\\n\\nThere are two types of lithosphere:\\n\\noceanic lithosphere \\ncontinental lithosphere \\nOceanic lithosphere is about 70 km thick (but can be as thin as 1.6 km at the mid-ocean ridges), while continental lithosphere is about 150 km thick (and can be considerably thicker at continental collision zones). Oceanic lithosphere consists mainly of mafic and ultramafic rocks and is denser than continental lithosphere, which consists predominantly of felsic rocks. This higher density has the effect that at subduction zones the oceanic plate will invariably sink underneath the continental plate. New oceanic lithosphere is constantly being produced at mid-ocean ridges from mantle material and is recycled back to the mantle at subduction zones. As a result, oceanic lithosphere is much younger than continental lithosphere: the oldest oceanic lithosphere is about 200 million years old, while parts of the continental lithosphere are billions of years old. As oceanic lithosphere grows older, it gets cooler and denser, with the result that if two oceanic plates converge, the older one will subduct below the younger one.

Here are some basics:\\n\\nS-Corp: limits personal liability of owners to investment in the business; LLC: ditto\\n\\nS-Corp: avoids "double taxation" of ordinary corporations.  (Standard corporations pay income tax, then distribute profits to owners, who pay tax again on the income.)  S-Corps pass profits to owners, who pay tax on the income, but the corporation itself only files a return and doesn't pay income tax.  LLC: can basically decide whether to be taxed like a corporation, like a simple partnership, or like a sole proprietorship.  The default rule depends on how many owners the LLC has, but you can file a form with the IRS to tell it you want a different option.\\n\\nS-Corp: ownership limited in number and restricted to natural persons (not other corporations) and legal residents; LLC: ownership not limited by number or citizenship/residency status\\n\\nYou might find it easier to complete the paperwork for an LLC, though both are well-designed for small businesses.\\n\\nIf you go with an S-Corp, be sure to check with your state to see whether they require you to file for S-Corp status with them, too.  I've had clients who filed S-Corp status with the IRS but not the state, then the state turns up in a few years wanting corporate income tax because the company was not an S-Corp in the state's eyes, just a regular, income-tax owing corporation.  It is a very good idea to consult with a locally licensed attorney on this decision, though you may be able to handle the actual set-up yourself.\\n\\nI hope that helps.  Good luck.

Well it depends on the circumstance.I have a 14 year old,10 nearly 11 year old,and a 3 year old.When my daughters were younger,I would give them time out,or take away their favourite toy for a day or 2,and explain to them why I have done this. this is what I do with my son now too.Now that the girls are getting older,again depending on what they have done,I either,take away their phone privileges,computer privileges, t.v privileges,take their stereo out of their rooms,or if my eldest is late without a good explanation,I don't allow her to go to whatever her next outing is,whether it's a party,if if she had planned to stay at a friends house on the weekend.Thank god I haven't had to do these  very often,because I think from a very early age they have learn that there are always going to be consequences for their actions,whether the consequences are bad or good.I have never raised a hand to my children,not because I don't believe in it,I have never had a need to.I hope I was of some help.take care.

Fort Minor- Remember The Name
Very people carefully observe the complicated distinctions between "shall" and "will" -- which are made much MORE complicated by the fact that in traditional use, the senses of each word used with the first person are "flipped" when used for the second and third persons.\\n\\nIn general, you probably do not need to worry about using it.  But in case you run across someone saying or writing "they shall" here's what to do with it (assuming they are using it correctly and not just acting snooty!) \\n\\n"you/they will" is a simple future tense (statement of fact)\\n"you/they shall"  implies something more, usually a guarantee (certainty) or obligation.\\n\\nIf you are familiar with the King James Version (or something like it) of the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount, you have plenty of good examples.\\n\\nThink, for instance, of command forms like "Thou shalt not" (modern "You shall not" or "Do not").  These express an obligation or demand.  Or consider the ending of each of the Beatitudes.  Each implies a promise/certainty ("they shall inherit the earth", etc. ) with the implication that the SPEAKER is certain or will make certain that it happens.    So, as an assurance, you might say (fomally) "They [you]  shall have what they [you] seek."  (Compare the biblical "Ask and you shall receive...")\\n\\n(Conversely with the first person.  Traditional "I shall" was the simple future, and "I will" was a strong statement of purpose/certainty, sometimes of WILL-fulness!  Think of someone  insisting, "I don't care what anyone says. I WILL find a way to do it.")
The first guideline that I found was:\\n\\n7500 BTU:     150 square feet\\n9000 BTU:     200 square feet\\n10000 BTU:   250 square feet\\n12000 BTU:   350 square feet\\n13000 BTU:   400 square feet\\n\\nSo, 12000 BTU is probably fine.

I'll give you two guesses, and the first one don't count.\\n\\nAnd dude, where do you get your facts about there not being evidence to show organic food is better for you?  You're the same kind of person who buys generic diapers that leak and say it's 'cause your kid's allergic to Pampers or 'cause there's no difference when plainly there is.

Look for the gifts it brings. Everything either teaches you a lesson, makes you stronger, or brings you closer to your true path in life. If you look back over your life, you'll usually be able to see that, without adversity, you would have missed out on a lot of fabulous experiences and you would not be the person you are today.

From 1991 to the present day the United States Air Force and Navy have slaughtered over 200,000 civilian people in Iraq with Depleted Uranium missiles, cluster bombs, cruise missiles and other so-called “smart bombs.”\\n During the “Desert Storm” terror campaign the arsenal also included fuel-air bombs and napalm. 177 million pounds of bombs were dropped on the people of Iraq in the most concentrated aerial bombardment in the history of the world. In the 110,000 sorties of the six-week onslaught the cowardly American and British pilots (and to a lesser extent French and Saudi pilots) mass-murdered at least 200,000 people, using depleted uranium missiles, napalm, cluster-bombs, fuel-air bombs, cruise missiles and other so-called “smart bombs.” The slaughter of civilian people in the Amariyah bomb shelter was a Prime example of this American/British state terrorism. Most of them were women, children, elderly, and invalids from a new housing development. Cowardly U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force jet pilots caught one sixty-mile-long column of fleeing Iraqi soldiers and Palestinian civilian families in vehicles on the Kuwait to Basra highway - and pounded them ruthlessly with bombs and machine-gun fire. The road, clogged by four lanes of one-way, bumper-to-bumper traffic, was carpet bombed by B-52s dropping 1,000-pound bombs, and repeatedly hit with laser-guided missiles and “smart” bombs. All the Iraqi soldiers, as well as Palestinian workers and their families, were slaughtered without mercy. The bloodthirsty American pilots gleefully described the massacre as “shooting in a sheep pen.” \\n During the Desert Storm terror campaign at least 944,000 rounds of Depleted Uranium ammo were fired from American A-10 Warthogs all over Iraq and Kuwait . When a depleted uranium tipped shell strikes a tank or armoured personnel carrier it easily penetrates the armour and burns the crew alive. The impact also vaporizes the depleted uranium, creating an aerosol of radioactive heavy-metal particles which can spread as far as 190 miles on the wind. When inhaled or ingested, the depleted uranium particles cause chemical and radioactive damage to the bronchial tree, kidneys, liver and bones. Cancer often results, and the effects can even include genetic damage. \\n The Dutch Laka Foundation estimates that the United States terror campaign left behind 300-800 tons of radioactive waste from this ammunition all over Kuwait and Iraq - poisoning the air, the land, the water and the people everywhere. Afterwards, wherever the depleted uranium firing had been concentrated, there were cancer epidemics among Iraqi civilians living nearby. In the ten years since then, sanctions, polluted water and depleted uranium together have killed somewhere between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 Iraqi civilian people. At least 600,000 of the dead are children. Cancer rates have quadrupled in areas of southern Iraq bombed by the American and British state terrorists. Since it began, thousands of Iraqi babies have been born with horrible birth defects. This is something that has never before been seen in Iraq . \\n Over the course of only 43 days and nights, approximately 62,000-80,000 air-delivered cluster bombs were dropped on the Iraqi people by the American-led state terrorists. In addition, 10,000 MLRS rockets and 100,000 “Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition” artillery shells were fired. All this translates to about 24-30 million “sub munitions” or bomblets. Assuming a dud rate of 5%, it is estimated that the number of Dangerous land-mine cluster bomblets lying on or just under the surface of the ground in Iraq and Kuwait would be from 1.2 to 1.5 million. At least. In the desert, however, the percentage of these duds rose to 30%. So the number of unexploded ordnance still lying in wait for unsuspecting Iraqi children and civilian people could be as high as 7 to 9 million bomblets. A Human Rights Watch report says that of the estimated 24 to 30 mi

The term Jim Crow comes from the minstrel show song "Jump Jim Crow" written in 1828 and performed by Thomas Dartmouth "Daddy" Rice, a white English migrant to the U.S. and the first popularizer of blackface performance. The song and blackface itself were an immediate hit. A caricature of a shabbily dressed rural black, "Jim Crow" became a standard character in minstrel shows. He was often paired with "Zip Coon," a flamboyantly dressed urban black who associated more with white culture. By 1837, Jim Crow was being used to refer to racial segregation.

Hey where did u get the wierd Idea?
you may not need to have any teeth pulled out with the new technology involving orthodontics now. Ask you dentist/orthodontist about invisalign (clear braces which arent attached and are only removed for eating or cleaning, you have a set which you wear for 2 weeks each time). There is also damon 3 brackets, visit www.ormco.com/damon. there is often no need for teeth to be removed, treatment time is 6 months less than conventional treatment and is less painful. they are very tiny and you do not need to wear elastics (which is the most cause of friction pain), the wire clips in and out which means less chairside time and discomfort for you, less force when moving is good for adult ortho care. I have them in at the moment. prob with invisalign is you often need to wear brackets after to get the best result. Have a look at the sites and talk to your orthodontist again
Yes it does happen but I think less often these days.  \\n\\nIn the extreme exertion of a marathon the body loses fluids, electrolytes (salts) and tends to overheat.  If a runner gets to a state of extreme dehydration and exhaustion the muscles that retain the 'poo' simply let go involuntarily.\\n\\nWith more knowlegeable runners, proper diet and hydration I think that this phenomena is now mostly behind us.
No, absolutely!\\nOtherwise we all should have problem or be impotent even!\\nOn the contrary, scientists says that a regular sexual life (mastu*bation too) helps the reproductive system to keep healthy, increasing the performance (libido) too.\\nSomebody even plays more time in a day and there’s no correlation with impotency or erection.\\nSo, don’t worry for that, while you only ought to care to don’t become too much addicted.\\nMastu*bation is a normal event, and with the age and stable relation should decrease till vanish.\\nOKAY?

Actually, you're right. Women ARE more likely to leave a marriage than a man. I read somewhere, long time ago (when my mom left my dad), something that said that women's needs change during the course of a relationship, while men's needs primarily stayed the same (and yes, this does include the phyiscal needs). \\n\\nFor example, a woman who falls in love and marries a man because he has an exotic job may decide five years later that the job "isn't enough" because she now needs someone who can be at home at 5:15 every single night to help take care of the kids. Her needs changed; his didn't. She married him because she ALSO loved the job - not just him - and now she doesn't love the job any more, and so, by consequence, she no longer loves him. Irreconcilable differences, you know.\\n\\nMen, on the other hand, will fall in love and marry a woman who happens to HAVE an exotic job. If she then decides to stay home and have kids, he will often stay dedicated to her because he "made that commitment" and will stay the course. If he does stray - as you admit some men do - it's often because the woman's needs have changed... and half the time, she's straying, too!\\n\\nMen also have been taught by their fathers, over the generations, that women are to be cared for (which I agree with) no matter what. Even though women were "liberated" 30 years ago, men are still being taught this value, and apparently they're listening! Women have taken this "liberation" and used it to their advantage as a gender, allowing themselves the freedom of escaping from home responsibilities that men have shouldered for centuries.\\n\\nNow... that's my opinion.... anyone else?
Yes. The infinitive in your example is "to push." And I have to disagree about others' opinions of split infinitives. There NEVER was a rule banning them. They are and have always been acceptable. Some time ago, someone knowing little about English, decided that since Latin infinitives couldn't be split (ha! Latin infinitives are one word), that English infinitives couldn't be split. Put the modifier where it has the most impact without creating confusion. Thus "To boldly go" is perfectly fine English -- and a very effective use of a "split infinitive."

Usually these durgs kick in, generally speaking, within 4-6 weeks or even earlier. Alternative drug should be considered if desired effect hasnt been obtained from  Luvox (Fluvoxamine) after 12 weeks of starting therapy, and it is 4-6 weeks in case of Lithium. Effectiveness of drugs also depend on the dose. It is unlikely for a drug to show any effect if the dose is suboptimal. However, u should consult the prescriber for dose adjustment or other options if you think u have been taking them for long enough. Hope it helps.

I don't think that the Earth is as small compared to the sun as a golf ball compared to the Earth itself. \\n\\nI would say a Red Supergiant, one like Antares, the alpha star in Scorpius, would be much like the Earth when the Earth is compared to a golf ball.\\n\\nNew!:\\nI just received the information from Wikipedia.com and I did some calculations. \\nthe diameter of a golf ball is about 0.00004 km, \\nthe diameter of our Earth is about 12756 km,\\nand the diamter of Antares is about 924000000 km. \\n\\nSince calculating the volume requires us to cube the radius (let us ignore the pi and 4/3 for simplicity's sake since in ratio, they don't matter). So:\\nthe cube of the radius of the golf ball is 8 x 10^(-15) km cubed,\\nthe cube of the radius of our Earth is 2.6 x 10^(11) km cubed,\\nand the cube of the radius of Antares is 9.9 x 10^(25) km cubed. \\n\\nWe can get a brief idea of their sizes by comparing the powers of 10: \\n\\ngolf ball -> Earth is\\n1 -> 100000000000000000000000000\\nEarth -> Antares is\\n1 -> 100000000000000\\n\\nSo Earth is far bigger than a golf ball than Antares is than Earth (at least from my calculations). \\n\\nNow, returning to the questions, I would say something 1000000000000 times the size of Antares, probably a nebula.

I think you came to the right place for advice. Your friends gave you advice that will only get you in trouble. Thank them for their opinions, but try doing this instead:\\n\\n1. I'd sit down alone and write out some possible reasons my friend said that. Then I'd ask myself, "Is this a normal way to behave for someone my age?" I would be honest with myself. (my guess is that you are completely normal)\\n\\n2. Then, I'd stop and think about the day when my Mom would no longer be alive...(my mother is very ill right now, dying of a disease) And, I'd realize then:\\n\\n"My friends can just shove it! I love my mother and she loves me. I'm normal. Things will change when and if I want them to."\\n\\nThen, if that girl teases you again, just ignore her and be glad you have a good mother.

surely its more to do with the effectiveness of the pill. in britain you can take it upto 72 hours later, but if you wait that long its only 50% as likely to prevent pregnancy than if you take it straight away.\\n\\ni think its more to do with the fact that the longer you leave it, the more likely it is that the embryo will have planted itself in the uterine lining, and that the body will have signalled the release of progesterone - the pregnancy hormone. after this time, you are pregnant, and only a much stronger pill that will cuase contractions of the unterus to dispell the embryo, will work.

My favorite thing to do in gymnastics is a layout full on the floor because it invovlves both twisting and flipping - and because it took me awhile to progress from the half twist to the full twist.  But now I can double twists on tumble track, both forward and backward.  So I feel like learning the full twist was hard, but I mastered twisting after that.  Now it's all a question of building up enough power to attain the height necessary to do double fulls on the floor.

It is totally a matter of personal preference..\\n\\nSome women or men like it natural, as it contains odors that are sexy to the man, as part of 'your scent' .. it can be a big turn on to leave it that way.  This is a minority group, in my experience.\\n\\nSome like it trimmed (it can have many styles), and either keep it a real close shave (which can be stubbly) or enough length that doesn't poke their parnter if they are down there playing around.\\n\\nThen there are those women that do not feel right unless ALL the hair is gone.. some wax and some shave.  It is more 'sanitary' in that there is no odor caused by the hair itself, on the flip side there IS no hair to protect the vagina, which is it's the original intent of having hair their - as is ears, nose and stuff.... o keep your body safe of foreign viruses/bacteria.  Most women IK know just feel cleaner with it shaved or waxed.  \\n\\nIt is a personal decision, and if you are alone, experiement, if you have a partner, it's best to also get their input - while it's not their body, they should have a say, for which for which you can still do what you want.  It's a respect thing to ask them their opinion.\\n\\nBest Wishes in your pursuit of 'which is best for you'.  :)\\n\\nI like the men trimmed as well, as it helps with oral on them.. just like I'm sure trimmed or shaved helps with oral on us.  :)  To each his/her own!!

I'm going to forego the assumption that everyone else has made regarding the status of your marriage and simply answer your question.\\n\\nThe short answer is no, there isn't currently a way to track your wife through your Acura TL navigation system.  However, several cellular phone companies offer GPS and for $9.99/mo. you can locate a cell phone user through services such as "Family Locator" through Sprint,  "Xora", "eTrace" and other applications through Nextel; and I'm sure other carriers are offering something similar.\\n\\nAs an aside, vehicles equipped with OBDIII (On-Board Diagnostics 3) have GPS tracking systems integrated into your cars ECM which will allow government agencies to track your location, speed, and even get updated data about the condition of your car (last time you had it serviced, for example).  With this technology they will be able to issue you a speeding ticket without even seeing you, or shut-down your car remotely if you don't pay your overdue parking tickets, etc.  The latest Chevy Corvette already has it.

Improves Concentration \\nAt work, chewing gum helps us concentrate on the task at hand. Many truck drivers find that chewing gum helps them stay alert at the wheel. \\n\\nEases Tension \\nAs early as 1939, scientific studies showed how chewing reduces muscular tension and helps people feel more at ease. Because it is so well-recognized for helping stay alert at the same time it eases tension, the U.S. Armed Forces have supplied chewing gum to its soldiers ever since World War I. It is still included in field and combat rations today. \\n\\nFreshens Breath \\nChewing gum, especially a mint-flavored gum like Wrigley's Spearmint or Doublemint, moistens and refreshes the mouth and throat and sweetens the breath.  \\n\\nHelps Fight Tooth Decay \\nAfter meals, it isn't always convenient to use a toothbrush. Chewing gum stimulates the production of saliva, which helps neutralize acids from foods that may cause tooth decay.

It is a long way from Star Trek, but teleportation - the disembodiment of an object in one location and its reconstruction in another - has been successfully carried out in a physics lab in Australia. \\nScientists at the Australian National University (ANU) made a beam of light disappear in one place and reappear in another a short distance away. \\n\\nWhen physicists teleported photons for the first time in 1997 they had to destroy the photons to be sure that the teleportation had been successful. Now a team at the University of Vienna has managed to teleport photons without destroying them. Jian-Wei Pan and colleagues believe that their method could be the next step towards long-distance quantum communication (J-W Pan et al. 2003 Nature 421 721).\\n\\nIn quantum teleportation the sender, normally called Alice, instantaneously transfers the quantum state of a particle to a receiver, called Bob. In most experiments so far Alice has teleported the quantum state of a photon - defined in terms of its polarization - to Bob. The photon itself is not transferred: rather Bob’s photon acquires exactly the same polarization as Alice’s. The uncertainty principle means that Alice cannot know the exact state of her photon, but another feature of quantum mechanics called “entanglement” means that this is not an obstacle to teleporting the state to Bob. \\n\\nQuantum entanglement essentially allows two particles to behave as one, regardless of how far apart they are. Photons can be entangled so that if one is vertically polarized, for instance, then the other photon in the pair is always horizontally polarized. \\n\\nIn a standard teleportation experiment a laser is directed at a crystal with nonlinear optical properties. Occasionally the photon will be “down-converted” into two lower energy photons, and sometimes these photons will have their polarizations entangled. In a teleportation experiment the beam is reflected back through the crystal to sometimes produce a second pair of entangled photons. By convention the photons in the first pair are labelled 2 and 3 (for mode 2 and mode 3), and those in the second pair are 1 and 4. Photons 1 and 2 are directed to Alice, photon 3 is sent to Bob and photon 4 is used as a trigger. A variety of mirrors, beamsplitters and polarizers are used to direct the photons to four detectors labelled D1, D2, D3 and T (for trigger). \\n\\nThe aim of the experiment is to transfer, or teleport, the polarization of photon 1 to photon 3. This is normally done by making a joint measurement on photons 1 and 2 which changes the polarization of the latter in such a way that photon 3 - which is entangled with it - always acquires the same polarization as the first photon. In other words the quantum state of photon 1 - which was unknown to Alice - has been teleported to photon 3. \\n\\nThe experiment was set up such that detectors D1, D2 and T all register photons at the same time when teleportation takes place. However, under certain circumstances - the emission of two photons each into modes 1 and 4 - it is possible for the same three detectors to register events even though there is no photon in mode 3 to teleport to. These spurious events mean that the D3 detector must also register - and destroy - a photon to be sure that teleportation has taken place. \\n\\nBy using a filter to reduce the intensity of the photons that are going to be teleported the researchers were able to significantly reduce the number of spurious detection events. The Vienna team could be 97% certain that the state had been teleported to photon 3 without actually having to detect it. Such a high accuracy means that the teleported photons could be used in “quantum repeaters” for long distance communication. The team now hopes to combine these results with a technique known as “entanglement purification” to further develop quantum communication over long distances.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe achievement confirms that in theory teleportation is possible, at
I don't think we are able to pin point a specific reason why.  Even though I hate Bush and everything he stands for, I can't blame him for everything that happens, but I will blame him for everything and anything that has to do with the government, like help to Katrina victims, Sept 11th, the war in Iraq, the deficit spending, social security's bankruptcy... things of that nature.  But there some even worst things happening like natural disasters killing hundreds of thousands that you just can't blame on anybody.  I guess these are the times we're living in and we should pick leaders who are apt and know how to handle such conflict and tragedy.

Guys and Girls are equally just as strange in their tactics for courting.\\n\\nThere are some different possibilities for your situation. I definitely need more specific information about how this guy is acting. But I’ll give it a shot.\\n\\nGuys are afraid that if they act like they like a girl too much that they will be turned off and ditch the guy.\\n\\nGuys are also afraid that if they put them selves out there to much they don’t want to get used by the girl.\\n\\nSome guys Ignore girls for an ego boost. Acting like they don’t give a poo about it. Mainly because it makes your more of a player if you act like you don’t need girls cause you already have so many.\\n\\nI doubt that this guy might be ignoring you because he is afraid of rejection by you. Some guys just ignore girls they like so they don’t have to deal with rejection. I’m guilty of that.\\n\\nOr he could just be a dick and not give a poo about you. And he could be just using you for whatever it is he might get.\\n\\nAnother option is he might just be really busy, caught up in his life. I go to school and work and girls don’t get to see me all the time they tend not to like the fact that I don’t have a whole lot of spare time to see them.\\n\\nWell I think that kinda covers some ground on the subject. I hope that helps. Good luck.

The partial pressure of H2 is just the total pressure minus the partial pressure of Ne.  The ratio of the H2 part press and total press gives the mole fraction of H2.  \\n\\nNow just calculate the number of moles in your 421 mL using the ideal gas equation  PV = nRT.  Solve for n, multiply this by the mole fraction of H2 to get the moles of H2, then multiply this by the mole weight of H2.\\n\\nI'll let you do the math.

Involuntary muscles are smooth, uninucleated, non-branching muscles that are not directly controllable at will. These include the radially arranged iris muscles, the digestive system, reproductive system, major blood vessels, the skin and internal organs, and are all controlled by the autonomic nervous systemThese muscles are not as free as the voluntary muscles such as your arms legs, fingers, etc..\\n\\nThe cardiac muscle in heart can be called an involuntary muscle, although it may be classified separately due to its structural differences. it is controlled by nerve impulses produced by a natural pacemaker called the sinoatrial node, the rate of which is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. smooth muscles are found in the digestive system, reproductive system, major blood vessels, the skin and internal organs, and is also controlled by the autonomic nervous system.\\n\\nSkeletal muscle is under conscious control and is, therefore, voluntary muscle.\\n\\n voluntary muscles =Somatic nervous system=The somatic nervous system is that part of the peripheral nervous system associated with the voluntary control of body movements through the action of skeletal muscles, and also reception of external stimuli. The somatic nervous system consists of afferent fibers that receive information from external sources, and efferent fibers that are responsible for muscle contraction.\\n\\nThe somatic system includes all the neurons connected with the muscles, sense organs and skin. It deals with sensory information and controls the movement of the body.\\n\\nThe basic route of the efferent somatic nervous system includes a two neuron sequence. The first is the upper motor neuron, whose cell body is located in the precentral gyrus (Brodman Area 4) of the brain. It receives stimuli from this area to control skeletal (voluntary) muscle. The upper motor neuron carries this stimulus down the corticospinal tract and synapses in the ventral horn of the spinal cord with the alpha motor neuron, a lower motor neuron. The upper motor neuron releases acetylcholine from its axon terminal knobs and these are received by nicotinic receptors on the alpha motor neuron. The alpha motor neurons cell body sends the stimulus down its axon via the ventral root of the spinal cord and proceeds to its neuromuscular junction of its skeletal muscle. There, it releases acetylcholine from its axon terminal knobs to the muscles nicotinic receptors, resulting in stimulus to contract the muscle.

I agree! Hilary Duff is multitalented! She can sing, act, and even design her own line of clothing and accessories for girls. She even announced that she wants to stay a virgin until married--what a great role model for girls! Her music is light-hearted, fun, has good messages and morals, and she even portrays easy to relate to characters that match well with how young adults are feeling! She is definitelty a gal on the right path and hopefully she will remain so for years to come! Rock on Hilary!!!!
Para-well she said it ..
The weather report doesn't tell you it is going to rain or snow, only that there is a likelyhood of that happening based on prior experience.  If you were going to role a die and someone told you there was a 50% chance of getting an even number, it doesn't make him wrong if you get an odd one.  Even if you get three odds in a row, he is still correct, it just didn't help you very much.  That is the limitation of a weather forecast.  It never says "it is going to rain", but that "rain is likely."

Biochemistry is essentially a narrow field of organic chemistry that deals with organic chemistry in living organisms.\\n\\nIf you like biology and chemistry, are interested in metabolic pathways, the chemistry of biomolecules, or medicine go with biochemistry. If you just like plain old chemistry, then organic chemistry may be the better choice.\\n\\nThe primary careers in both fields consist of lab work and research, but there are other options out there. If you want to make more money, you'll probably want to look into obtaining an M.A. or PhD. There are jobs for those with a B.S. or B.A., but you aren't going to make a whole lot of money.\\n\\nI would recommend talking with academic advisors in both fields at the university you will be attending. They can give you information on what classes you'll need to take for each major, possible career paths you can take, and so forth. Once you know the possible career paths, do some research and see what interests you the most.\\n\\nRemember that the average undergraduate college student changes their major about 4 times. Don't be afraid to dive in to something because you can always change your mind down the road. In the case of organic chemistry and biochemistry, the classes will probably be the same up until your 2nd year anyways.\\n\\nMost importantly, have fun and make sure you enjoy the field you are in! You'll find college a lot easier and a lot more enjoyable!

Businesses must register with the Secretary of State in your state.  At that time you will have a legally registered company (LLC or Corp, etc).  You can do this yourself, or use an attorney.  In this case you might call the entity ABC Enterprises, LLC.  If you want to conduct business using other names, you must file an assumed name (or D.B.A. doing Business as).  This is sometimes regulated by the state, but usually the county you live in.  Call you county clerks office to check on this.\\n\\nYou could then have several assumed names doing different things, all under the umberall of ABC Enterprises, LLC\\n\\nABC Shipping\\nABC Shopping\\nABC Whatever\\n\\nThis would save you money, as DBA filings are cheap vs LLC filings expensive.

The following healthy living recommendations will help you if your trying to lose weight, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:\\n\\n*1) Burn more calories then your consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity. Get a fitness calculator that you can put on your cell phone and computer. This will allow you to easily  calculate this formula, log your daily calorie consumption, and log your physical activities.\\n\\n*2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement. \\n\\nAvoid “High Glycemic Load Carbs” (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as white potatoes) and drink lots of water. \\n\\nDo not try fad diets. Here is an excellent food pyramid that anyone can follow: http://www.rayandterry.com/html/images/PyramidLRG.gif?osCsid=26a424be471d1337e7c2f105d5c64d9d\\n\\n*3) Exercise on most days by doing cardiovascular training and/or resistance training activities. \\n\\nRead a book or find a certified trainer to make sure your doing all resistance training exercises correctly. A great book to buy that teaches you the resistance training basics is “Weight Training For Dummies”. A superb magazine to buy with excellent resistance training routines that will not get you bored is "Muscle and Fitness". Signup for the free newsletter.\\n\\nA good book to buy that teaches you the cardiovascular training basics is “Fitness For Dummies”. \\n\\n*4) Get plenty of sleep. Sleep experts say most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night for optimum performance, health, and safety. \\n\\n*5) Educate yourself continually on health issues. A good free publication is  “Dietary Guidelines For Americans 2005”. A superb book to read is “You The Owner’s Manual”. An excellent periodic publication is the “Nutrition Action Health Letter”.\\n\\n*6) Make a life long commitment to good health. A great test you can take to measure your biological age is at http://realage.com Look at other areas where you can improve your health. For example, make improvements on the quality of the air you breath. Review outdoor air quality forecasts where you live and get an indoor air purifier.

To understand the answer better, I have prepared a small course on CD's for you. \\n\\n--How the CD is constructed--\\nA CD is a fairly simple piece of plastic, about four one-hundredths (4/100) of an inch (1.2 mm) thick. Most of a CD consists of an injection-molded piece of clear polycarbonate plastic. \\n\\nDuring manufacturing, this plastic is impressed with microscopic bumps arranged as a single, continuous, extremely long spiral track of data. Once the clear piece of polycarbonate is formed, a thin, reflective aluminum layer is sputtered onto the disc, covering the bumps. Then a thin acrylic layer is sprayed over the aluminum to protect it.\\n\\n--The spiral on a CD--\\nA CD has a single spiral track where data is burned on, circling from the inside of the disc to the outside. It is extremely small - approximately 0.5 microns wide, with 1.6 microns separating one track from the next. (A micron is a millionth of a meter.)\\n\\n--How things are written onto a CD--\\nInformation are burned into the plastic of a CD in the form of small pits, or bumps. The bumps that make up the round track are each 0.5 microns wide, a minimum of 0.83 microns long and 125 nanometers high. (A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.)\\n\\nThe incredibly small dimensions of the bumps make the spiral track on a CD extremely long. If you could lift the data track off a CD and stretch it out into a straight line, it would be 0.5 microns wide and almost 3.5 miles (5 km) long! \\n\\nA CD drive has a laser beam which shines onto the track of the CD and picks up the bumps. The bumps are converted to information that the computer or CD player understands.\\n\\nIf you want more detailed information, visit http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/cd.htm\\n\\nHope I could help...

After dating my GF for a few months she said she loved me and then asked me if I loved her.  I was honest and said I don't know.  I told her I liked her a lot, but I don't throw the world "love" around like most people.  When I say it I truly mean it and that I didn't know her well enough to say it.  She was a bit upset at the time, but a few months later when I did, she was really happy.  Be honest, I'd rather have someone tell me they didn't love me, than find out a while down the road.

Uterine fibroids, adenomyosis and a hormone imbalance are 3 major causes of heavy menstrual bleeding.  Given your cramping, I would suspect the first two.  You are bleeding far too much and it does need to be addressed in order to protect your health.  Treatments include medical and surgical options, like oral contraceptives, endometrial ablation and/or surgical treatment of the fibroids or adenomyosis (if they prove to be the cause).  The cure for adenomyosis is a hysterectomy, but sometimes endometrial ablation can help some women with the disorder.  A local women's clinic, Planned Parenthood or similar organization should be able to help you with diagnosis and treatment on a sliding scale basis if lack of insurance is an issue.  Good luck!

My sons had a weird schedule like this too and I'd suggest that if it doesn't bother your son, then leave it be.  I don't think the school needs a bunch of parents trying to figure their system out and take up their time, that they may not have.  Leave it be.  If there are any quirks, the school will figure it out and fix the problem.  Wait it out while they figure it out themselves.  I'm sure they understand there needs to be time for the child to walk to their other classroom in between time schedules.  I believe they're trying to fit classes into a system where they'll have math one morning, and then math in the afternoon another day because some kids learn better in the morning and other kids learn better in the afternoon.  They're the pros, let them figure it out.  You're not the one who has to follow the schedule and I bet the kids, your kid too, can and will follow it without a problem.  Just hang in there and have some faith in the teachers.  Good luck!

Definition\\n\\nYour body needs carbohydrates to keep it going. Carbohydrates, a form of energy, are broken down into a simple sugar called glucose, which every cell in your body needs to survive. Glucose passes from the small intestine into the bloodstream. Cells require the hormone insulin, produced by the pancreas, which allows glucose to pass from the blood into cells. In type 2 diabetes, the body's cells are resistant to the actions of insulin and the pancreas produces too little insulin. Glucose builds up in the blood and spills into the urine. High blood glucose levels cause the health problems, such as heart disease, associated with diabetes.\\n\\nThis form of diabetes accounts for 90 to 95 percent of all cases in the United States. People with type 2 diabetes usually develop the condition after age 45, and the risk for getting it increases with age. About 18 percent of the U.S. population 65 and older has diabetes. However, the number of children with type 2 diabetes is increasing rapidly along with their rising obesity rates.\\n\\nPrognosis\\n\\nDiabetes does not have a cure.

Liniment, from the Latin linere, to anoint, is a medicated topical preparation for application to the skin. Liniments are of a similar viscosity to lotions (being significantly less viscous than an ointment or cream) but unlike a lotion a liniment is applied with friction, that is a liniment is always rubbed in.\\n\\nLiniments are typically sold to relieve pain and stiffness, such as from sore muscles or from arthritis. These liniments typically are formulated from alcohol.\\n\\nNow Horse liniment is Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). While DMSO has a low toxicity, prolonged exposure can cause dermatitis and possibly damage the liver or kidneys.\\n\\nIt is commonly used as a liniment for horses, although its use in humans is controversial.

It is quite possible that not everyone is as diligent in their work as you are. Also very possible that the workers in question think they are helping by doing what they do. Alot of the people in question had children who were American citzens, though their parents are not. Because the children themselves are eligible citizens, they can get welfare or food stamps to feed them. In fact, through an article in the L.A times, the county supervisor said that about 100,000 children of illegal immigrants in the county collect $276 million in annual welfare benefits. He also stated that 98,703 children of 57,458 undocumented parents received Cal-WORKS welfare checks in January, or a total of 156,161 recipients. Most of this was because the children were citizens. Though I am not familiar with Cal-Works or what benefit it entails, studies have found that due to 1996 restrictions, it is harder for illegals as well as natives to get welfare. But, the proportion of illegals who get food stamps and medacaid is significantly higher than that of the native population. In fact, it was found post 1996 reform that the percent of illegals who naturalized jumped significantly, all among those who had once received aid. It was also found that one in three families headed by an illegal immigrant is using one type of welfare or another. And because they are not usually educated people and are often low skill workers, the ones that do contribute taxes contribute much less than other families. For this reason, if we legalized them tax payments would increase 77%, but the net deficit would rise to 117%, because they would be legal to receive all the services that they are currently having difficulty accessing now.

You have three options.\\n1) Rent from an individual who will not run a credit/background check.  Of course if they own more than one unit (i.e. apartments instead of a house) you risk having neighbors who have done gods-only-know-what because 99% of the time the criminal background check is done with the credit check.\\n2) Go to public housing, but I thought you said no dumps....\\n3) Admit up front what the issues are and keep looking until you find a property manager who is willing to work with you.  You may be required to put down an additional deposit, but it won't be as bad as other options.  If you chose to do this option, MAKE SURE you talk to the property manager, not an assistant or a leasing agent as they are not authorized (generally speaking) to make those kinds of decisions.\\n\\nMy family was in a similar situation a few months ago but thankfully we found a community that had just emptied due to renovations and was trying to lease up again fast.  The manager was willing to work with us because she needed the occupancy.

Well.. supposedly....A Belgian inventor named Joseph Merlin introduced the first patented roller skate in 1760. What an introduction! He wore his new skates to a party in London, where he crashed into a very expensive mirror. He wasn't very interested in skating after this experience. However, other inventors produced some roller skate models, most with in-line wheels to imitate and ice skating blade.

The Akosombo Dam is a hydroelectric dam in southeastern Ghana. The dam created the largest man-made lake, known as Lake Volta. The dam provides electricity to Ghana and surrounding West African countries.\\n\\n\\nThe dam is 660 meters wide and 114 meters high. It was built between 1961 and 1965. In periods of drought, the water in Lake Volta is rationed and less electricity is generated. During these times, cities in Ghana are subjected to rolling blackouts to lessen their consumption of electricity. Ghana's Volta River Authority has contracts with neighbouring countries for electricity. These contracts are given higher priority than the customers in Ghana's own cities. Though Kaiser Aluminum is a major user, and the dam was constructed in part for the smelting of local bauxite, the economics have turned out such that raw materials have to be imported to keep the industry running.
Sounds like the regional manager is trying to cover her mistake in hiring the guy.  Report it and report the theft.  If he saw the kid take the money then that is all the proof he needs.  She must have told him that he would get fired.  Some companies expect loyalty from employees though and if thefts are occuring on a shift they DO fire everyone for not watching out for the thefts.  The company can hire and fire anyone they wish.  In this case he was watching out for thefts and caught the kid, what else would a company ask from a manager/employee?

The market is 'risk efficient': investment vehicles with the highest reward also have the highest risk.\\n\\nAs an example, ETFs of emerging stock markets have performed best in the last 2 years, but they are extremely risky and volatile (check the market action in the last few weeks).\\n\\nOne way to reduce risk while maintaining performance is to diversify: by holding ETFs covering different asset classes (such as US, foreign, small-cap etc...), the risk of your total portfolio will be less than the risk of its components taken separately.

If you want to play video games for 20 hours a day, fire up the computer and go at it. \\n\\nIt will probably take a semester or two to really figure out the best way to be efficent in your studying while getting the best results.

I had a biology teacher in high school say once that there was only one case of parthenogenesis (so-called vigin birth) in humans...Jesus Christ.  Parthenogenesis in vertebrates usually involves all-female species where the females lay diploid eggs that develop into diploid females.  Because human males have an X and a Y chromosomes and females two X's, the parthenogeneis explanation is impossible (unless Jesus was female).\\n\\nBut, in insects and some other animals, unfertilized (haploid) eggs develop into males - but this is impossible in humans.  So Jesus would have to have been diploid (that is if he existed) and we would have to assume that he got the Y chromosome from God (if he exists).
I'm very sorry for your difficulties.  Forget the "tricks".  It might be helpful to try getting real help from someone you know and trust.  I know there are those who feel strongly for and against using medications, therapy etc, but I am not going to advise you on that.  What I can suggest is that you try building a very rigid daily routine.  Write it down, then follow it.  Start with the first part of your day, if that's easier, then gradually add to it.  Remember too that it takes about three weeks for most people to effectively build a habit.  Best of luck.
You don't need to. If you believe in Jesus Christ and God's salvation, you're gonna go to heaven. God will look after them much much better than you can. So enjoy your stay with God!

Friends,\\n\\nSpiritually, I am of Israel.  Spiritually, Abraham is my forefather.  I believe and know that God’s New Covenant brings Israel and the Gentiles together through the Messiah Jesus.  My testimony is very long…\\n\\nI was born as a result of a promise, that my Mother made to God.  She prayed saying that if God would give her a baby girl, she would bring her up, teaching her about him… and that she would be for his work.  And so, here I am.\\n\\nShe never told me of this promise, until I accepted Jesus.  And I do believe that the evil spirits, namely, Satan, heard of this promise concerning me… in the presence of the Lord… as in the case of Job.  For all of my life, I have been persecuted by peoples, and I have known many demon-possessed persons, who have tried to led me further astray, into Wicca, so forth.    Nevertheless, I was a rebellious person, and I did not trust in Jesus… until I was thirteen. \\n\\nAs a teenager I was restless in heart.  I find that I was fearful of true Christianity… fearful to put my trust in Jesus.  I wondered if Jesus were truly real… even if God was real… but if God were not real, I wondered… why did anything exist… why did I exist… as ‘complicated’ as I am… what was I to do… where would I go after death… in my mind I am so real… how could I only cease to exist after I died?\\n\\nWith horrifying thoughts plaguing me more and more… I could not sleep… my heart was so restless… with wondering about religions, views… and Jesus.  \\n\\nThis was how the nights were until one Sunday morning.  My parents and I went to a place where a Congregation gathered for worship.  At the end of the service… the Spirit of God began convicting me… showing me that I was a sinner… calling to me… to come and accept his sacrifice and be justified… calling me to be his Disciple.  I was afraid… afraid of the call… afraid of being persecuted… extremely fearful.  And I resisted.  \\n\\nOh, and the week was misery and restlessness.\\n\\nThe next Sunday, God who is full of mercy and compassion… convicted me again… calling me to him… and I being fearful… did not know what to do… how could I resist him?  He is so loving and full of compassion… and then was the temptation of the evil one (I didn’t know it was his minions to begin with)… “you don’t need to accept… the people will laugh… they will stare at you for accepting.”  But there was the first step… and afterward the temptation fled… I believed in my heart that Jesus was Lord… I confessed that Jesus is Lord… believing that God raised him from the dead.  \\n\\nAnd so, I was justified in the sight of God. \\n\\nBut, instead of continuing in my sanctification… I became lukewarm.  No one taught about God’s image… no one taught about knowing God personally… they only preached what they wanted to hear about the Gospel.  \\n\\nNevertheless, I became tired of the ignorance around me.  Mainly… tired of MY ignorance.  I began praying, searching for God… asking God “where are you,” “what are you like?”  and praying “Lord, I really want to know you, I want to know you as Father, Son, and Spirit, I want to KNOW you.”  My prayers were constantly before the Father and intense in emotion.  Because I wanted to know his living and active words, I wanted to hear him, I wanted to really know him.  I wanted him to ‘be’ my Wonderful Counselor.  My human father had died, and I wanted my HEAVENLY FATHER.\\n\\nI knew that if the Prophets and the Apostles heard God… I could too.  I knew that if the Holy Spirit poured out the love of God into the hearts of the early Christians… he could pour out his love into my heart. (Romans 5:5)\\n\\nI became more and more aware of the spiritual part of our world… and I became closer and closer to God, through Jesus my Messiah.  God began to be nigh because I wanted to be nigh to him.  God really does speak.  I can call out “Abba” and he has said “H

We actually had our baby's ears checked in the hospital a couple of days after he was born, so you can certainly get them checked at 2 1/2. They use some method with electrodes (just on the outside of the child's head) and can see whether the sounds are being received in the brain... so it doesn't rely on the kid's being able to say whether he heard something or not.
That is classic dehyration...you must drink water....make sure you have a drink a little while before you go to the gym and then afterwards and keep your salt intake regular as you sweat a lot out, so it will need replaced, just as it does in a hot climate....keep fit and well!
It's like people expected Iraqis to be cool with invasion and takeover.  What?  They don't WANT to be conquered by the USA?  They actually get PISSED when chemical weapons are used against civilians?  \\n\\nAt least the troops can take comfort that so many Americans "Support the Troops".  You can tell because so many put so much effort into applying magnetic yellow ribbons to the back of their cars & trucks.  If that's not support, I don't know what is.\\n\\nSo many of these patriots even take supporting the troops a step further, by unquestioningly supporting the man who sent them into Iraq on a big pile of lies, only to turn around and cut vet benefits.  Yessir, THAT is "support".

Marcus Brutus: Roman senator and praetor who helps plan and carry out Caesar's assassination. Historically, Marcus Junius Brutus (84-42 B.C.) enjoyed a reputation in his day among Roman republicans as a noble and fair-minded statesman. However, his opponents–notably supporters of Caesar–regarded him as a traitor. First, Brutus sided with Pompey the Great against Caesar when the Roman Civil War started in 49 B.C. After Caesar defeated Pompey at Pharsalus, Greece, in 48 B.C., he pardoned Brutus and appointed him governor of Cisalpine Gaul in 46 B.C. and a praetor of Rome in 44 B.C. But Brutus turned against Caesar a second time, helping to lead the conspiracy that led to Caesar’s assassination in 44 B.C. Brutus believed the action was necessary to prevent Caesar from becoming dictator-for-life, meaning that all power would reside in Caesar and not in the delegates representing the people. In Shakespeare’s play, Brutus’s nobility and idealism gain the audience’s sympathy. But in the ancient Roman world of power politics, characterized by perfidy and pragmatism, it is his virtues that doom him. His downfall and death are the real tragedy of the play, not the death of Caesar.  \\n\\nWow, lot of info.  Definitely an interesting character--above quote from last link.
Jewish people aren't, categorically, different from anyone else - when offended, we act just like anyone does, getting mad for a while and (hopefully) coming to forgive that person in the end.\\n\\nOur religion teaches us to forgive - on Yom Kippur, which is the Day of Atonement, we explicitly seek for forgive everyone who has wronged us, and pray that they will forgive us. The rabbis teach that praying to God for forgiveness on Yom Kippur seeks forgiveness for sins against God - failure to keep the sabbath, taking His name in vain - but forgiveness for sins against another person only comes when that other person has forgiven. So, we seek to forgive those that have hurt us, so that they may be completely forgiven for their wrongs.\\n\\nThere's a parallel to most other religions I can think of - while the greatest teachers of peace have learned to forgive their enemies even in the moment that they are being harmed, those of us who can't are still taught to forgive as much as possible, and called on to remember where we nurse grudges and let them heal.\\n\\nHope this helps.

I think about 1/3 of the people come one here for a legitimate reason....to gain knowledge about something they know thing about, need help in, etc.  I found this site by accident, trying to help my daughter find an answer regarding algebra (not my subject, just ask the teachers I had in high school).  Read all the info about how to get points so you can ask more questions if you so desire so I figured I would answer questions, etc. just in case she needed more help with something I can't answer.\\n\\nI saw some really stupid questions, and I had to laugh when I saw a lot of people giving dumb answers or just the typical "thanks for the 2 points" answers.  I don't even bother with them.  Yeah, I could get 2 easy points but like I said I don't bother with it.  It's kind of pointless.\\n\\nThis thing can be addicting as far as answer questions (good or stupid) and really wanting to help someone.

The most basic way to build up the arms are the push-up and bicep curls.  I recommend a pair of light dumbells for the bicep curl. \\nhttp://www.womensheartfoundation.org/images/c4.gif\\nFor the triceps do as many pushups as you can with your hands at a close grip.  Most women find this very hard to do,  so you may want to try the modified version - http://www.givstrength.com/presents/exercise/images/originalpushups/modified%20pushups/modified-pushups-1.jpg.  Notice her arm tone! The standard pushup alone will tone the triceps but will also tone the chest and front of the shoulders as well.  The push up is probably one of the best excercises for the upper body because you can do them so many different ways,  and I've never heard of anyone getting hurt while doing them.  I hope this helps,  and train safe.
Marriage has always been defined as the union between one man and one woman.  Homosexuals who love each other want the same status and standing as heterosexuals.  One of the chief concerns is, if we change the definition of marriage to include same sex couples, then it will also be expanded to include other unions such as:  multiple partners, adults and children, adults and animals, and whatever can be imagined by human beings.  \\n\\nIt has been suggested that same sex couples be provided the same rights that marriage allows, but it is most often stated in the media that same sex couples not only want the same rights, they want the same standing or respect.  They too want to be called "married".  \\n\\nMany heterosexual couples are troubled by this demand because they believe marriage is a sacred trust and gift from God. They believe that marriage was instituted by God in Genesis and that God will return for his spiritual Bride in Revelation 21.  Those who are opposed to homosexual marriage would state that marriage was created by God to support the family; one man, one woman and children.  They would also state that the heterosexual family is and has been the foundation of society and culture for thousands of years.  \\n\\nThere are of couse exceptions in history and even presently.  There is also currently a high divorce rate but married heterosexuals would argue that failure in marriage does not justify changing the definition of what marriage is....one man and one woman.  Society often makes moral changes without considering the consequences or justifying the decision by stating what is wrong with the present model.  Abortion started this way, with the declaration that women's lives were in danger and women were killing themselves by attempting abortions at home or in back alleys under the care of unscrupulous doctors.  Abortion has now become a form of birth control with well over one million babies aborted yearly in the U.S. alone.  \\n\\nMany heterosexual couples see the changing of marriage to include same sex couples as fallling further and further away from what is healthy for society and farther down the road toward a loss of morality and moral standards.  They do not want marriage, which they consider sacred, changed to include other unions.  They would prefer,if same sex couples are permitted to be "married"  that same sex couples be granted the same rights but not the same name.  A different name such as "union" or the invention of a completely new word.
Well it all depends on the person. Yahoo answers can be addictive if you start to enjoy reading and answering questions. My Space is addictive once you learn how to use HTML. There is no turning back, but it serves a general purpose young kids are learning how to build web pages and code web logs. So both are productive in there own way but are they both trully addictive.

Bluetooth is a low power short range radio communications technology for connecting equipment together when it requires relatively little bandwidth. Typical uses are for attaching PDAs to peripherals (I have a bluetooth GPS receiver semi permanently installed in my car) and connecting headsets to mobile phones. It opperates on the same frequencies as 802.11b/g but uses different spread spectrum encoding so that they can coexist even though the 802.11 uses vastly more power.

For a lot of reasons. It actually depends on the person involved.\\n\\nFor one thing, it could be because the person is simply restless in nature. People who belong to this category often are found doing other things besides the one that they are currently working on.\\n\\nAnother, it is probably because it is a habit that one has developed in the earlier parts of one's life. Pressumably the parents of this person is observed talking on the phone with notepads. In an artistic way, this person is incorporating what his/her subconscious has picked up from her past.\\n\\nStill, it could be that the person is a workaholic. Someone who falls under this catergory cannot simply focus on doing one task alone. For them, though not really intentionally, talking idly on the phone consumes work time. These are the type of people that cannot keep their hands still, and due to the skill inherent to one person, he begins to multitask. Or in this situation, draw.\\n\\nLastly, it could simply be because the person is simply... uninterested of the conversation and feels the need to do something other than talking idly on the phone.\\n\\nOfcourse, there are sometimes where in a person is a combination of these categories. ^^\\n\\nI hope it helps!

As every one has mentioned that Infarc is a term for heart attack. It can be mild or major. If they sent you home then chances are that it was an old infarc and that you had no clinical indications for being there, HOWEVER IF YOU ARE CONTINUING TO EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS YOU NEED TO BE RE-EVALUATED. a blood pressure of 74/45 is cause for major concern if you do not normally have low blood pressure. You need to be seen and followed by a cardiologist.  Saying that it was no big deal is WRONG. Especially at 35. \\n\\nYou need a full work up including laboratory, stress test, and possibly cardiac cath (if testing shows nothing but a possible old MI INSIST ON THE CARDIAC CATH, my best friend was 33 with some cardiac issues considered minor. she had a thallium stress test that revealed nothing, a week later she had a Major MI at work that she did not survive.

Barriers is a set of purer-than-pure Berlin school electronica. The Nightcrawlers -- Peter Gulch, Tom Gulch, and David Lunt -- were known for this style of e-music. Unfortunately, their fan base can best be described as a cult following. Despite their purity and excellence, this trio never achieved anything close to the recognition that they deserved. All of their albums and cassettes are long out of print and only a small portion of their prodigious output has been remastered for CD reissue. This rare slice of history is essential electronica. It is worth every effort to track it down. ~ Jim Brenholts, All Music Guide

Glass is a combination of sand, flint, spar, or some other silicious substances, with one or other of the fixed alkalies, and in some cases with a metallic oxide. Of the alkalies, soda is commonly preferred; and of the silicious substances, white sand is most in repute at present, as it requires no preparation for coarse goods, while mere washing in water is sufficient for those of a finer quality. The metallic oxide usually employed, is litharge, or some other preparation of lead. Iron is used in bottle-glass. \\n\\nThe silicious matter should be fused in contact with something called a flux. The substances proper for this purpose are lead, borax, arsenic, nitre, or any alkaline matter. The lead is used in the state of red-lead; and the alkalies are soda, pearlash, sea-salt, and wood-ashes. When red-lead is used alone, it gives the glass a yellow cast and requires the addition of nitre to correct it. Arsenic, in the same manner, if used in excess, is apt to render the glass milky. For a perfectly transparent glass, the pearlash is found much superior to lead; perhaps better than any other flux, except it be borax, which is too expensive to be used, except for experiments, or for the best looking-glasses. \\n\\nThe materials for making glass must first be reduced to powder, which is done in mortars or by horse mills. After sifting out the coarse parts, the proper proportions of silex and flux are mixed together, and put into the calcining furnace, where they are kept in a moderate heat for 5 or 6 hours, being frequently stirred about during the process. When taken out the matter is called frit. Frit is easily converted into glass by only pounding it, and vitrifying it in the melting pots of the glass furnace; but in making fine glass, it will sometimes require a small addition of flux to the frit to correct any fault. For, as the flux is the most expensive article, the manufacturer will rather put too little at first than otherwise, as he can remedy this defect in the melting pot. The heat in the furnace must be kept up until the glass is brought to a state of perfect fusion; and during this process any scum which arises must be removed by ladles. When the glass is perfectly melted, the glass-blowers commence their operations.

We don't know when exactly when Jesus was born(could be the summer) and that case even the year. The bible is not persice when it comes to this matter so the do the early christian leaders do was genius. They want to mark a specific date to rebemer Jesus birth and they want to convert people aslo so.  So they pick a roman pagan holiday that was at the end of each year and replace it with the christain holiday christmas.  Christanity is very flexable at incorparting new thing to convert people. How do you thing the Christmas tree got started?
This is like asking, "What does blue smell like?" Blue is not in the category of things that have odor, so the question itself is flawed. In the same way, God is not in the category of things that are created, or come into existence, or are caused. God is uncaused and uncreated - He simply exists.  How do we know this? Well, we know that from nothing, nothing comes. So if there was ever a time when there was absolutely nothing in existence then nothing would have ever come to exist. But things do exist. Therefore, since there could never have been absolutely nothing, something had to have always been existing. That ever-existing thing is what we call God.
The discussion of that question is a common one. However, I find that its pointless to discuss. If we are, then we'll never know, and we might as well have fun in the dream. If we aren't, we're wasting time worrying about it.

The HSE website should have score charts or tables for you to make a calculation then it is normally down to the company to determine at what score they take action i.e.\\n\\nThe likelihood of the accident will be affected by a few things ;\\n\\nHow often is the activity undertaken, once per shift, once per hour or more - the more often the greater the risk. Is the ladder in good order, does it have a hand rail. Is the floor slippery, does the employee have adequate footware etc.\\n\\nThe severity of tha accident will also be affected by a number of things like , does the employee have adequate ppe, how high is the ladder, will he fall onto something, will he be hit by something, and also will he be found quickly if he knocs himself out.\\n\\nHope this helps.

Sodas are carbonated, meaning that they have Carbon Dioxide gas dissolved in the liquid.  When a soda goes "flat", almost all the Carbon Dioxide has escaped.\\n\\nCarbon Dioxide is a gass at any normal pressure/temperature we would deal with soda at (refrigerator, store shelf, ...), and being a gas, its solubility in water depends greatly on two things, the temperature of the solution and the pressure above the solution.\\nA lower temperature or higher pressure makes CO2 gas more soluble in water, thus it is always best to keep your botttles closes and in the refrigerator in order to keep the soda from going flat.\\n\\nThe carbon Dioxide gass dissolved in the water reaches an equilibrium with CO2 that has gotten out of solution and has become trapped inside the bottle above the liquid, when this happens, the amount of CO2 in solution is constant.  When you open the bottle and relieve the pressure above the liquid, the equilibrium is disturned and the gas dissolved in the liquid comes out of solution to try to re-establish the equilibrium.  That is why you see a bunch of bubbles when you open a soda bottle/can, it is the CO2 gas coming out of solution due to the decrease in pressure.

God created them plan and simple.  The earth before the flood (which very major civilizations has a flood story and there is ecological evidence for a flood.)  had a much different atmosphere then we do now and this allowed animals to grow much larger then they do now.  so this can accommodate some fossils but still dinosaurs and humans coexisted.  and there is proof.  there is identifiable dinosaur footprints that were made with man's footprints next to and crossing the dinosaurs foot prints.  the same evidence scientist use to disprove God proves Dinosaurs and man thought to be separated by 65 million years lived side by side.  and yes i have seen these fossils they are real but evolutionist doesn't  want the public to know about these footprints because it destroys  everything they believe in.  creation sings the wonderful Glory of God

The odds are very poor whether you are in Australia or US -- unless you have something to provide the bank as collateral. A restaurant is not something that you can do for $1000 only -- you need more; and for a financial institution to give you a loan, you need to show that you are capable of repaying the loan, that you have a strong business, you have experience in the business or a strong management team will help you, you have collateral and you have the right character. Banks simply want to make sure that they can get their money bank. Right now, with your conditions, you are too-high risk to be provided with a loan.

Your eye will be covered the day of surgery with a patch and a metal shield. Your glasses may not fit over the patch and shield, but your physician will probably remove the patch and shield the next day. You must then wear either your glasses or the shield while awake to protect your eye. You MUST wear the shield over your eye while sleeping. Do not rub your eye. You will see your physician in the clinic the day following surgery. You will then need to be checked periodically during the next 3 months. Your physician will determine how frequently you will need to return. Vision may be blurred in the operated eye right after surgery. It should gradually improve as healing progresses. Many patients see better within a few days. Between 4 and 12 weeks after surgery your physician will prescribe a new lens for your glasses.

I dont understand why people are saying no.. its not like he moved away cause he doesnt love you right? he dumped you cause hes moving... If thats the case then try to make it work!! nothing wrong with giving it a shot... I lived over an hour away from my bf and we made it work until last november whe nwe decided to move in together... Just becuase he is busy doesnt mean that he doesnt think about you.. And if you remained together in the past.. you already kno what will happen emotional wise.. Yeah your phone bill might get a bit higher... If thats the case, switch phone plans or talk online (voice chat is the way to go baby!).. if you really love him.. tell him you dont want to break up and that you still wanna be with him even tho he is a bit far off.. If your willing to put that much into it the first time... why give up now! he might be the one!

Kwanzaa (Kwaanza) is a week-long secular holiday honoring African-American heritage, observed from December 26 to January 1 each year, almost exclusively by African-Americans in the United States of America, though Africans of the diaspora in many countries have begun to practice its observances as well.\\n\\nKwanzaa consists of seven days of celebration, featuring activities such as candle-lighting and pouring of libations, and culminating in a feast and gift-giving. It was founded by black nationalist Dr. Ron "Maulana" Karenga, and first celebrated from December 26, 1966, to January 1, 1967. Karenga calls Kwanzaa the African American branch of "first fruits" celebrations of classical African cultures.

The more honourable of those appointed to supervise his life he could not endure, but the most evil he retained, and, if any were dismissed, he yearned for them even to the point of falling sick. 7When they were reinstated through his father's indulgence, he always maintained eating-houses and low resorts for them in the imperial palace. He never showed regard for either decency or expense. 8He diced in his own home. He herded together women of unusual beauty, keeping them like purchased prostitutes in a sort of brothel for the violation of their chastity. He imitated the hucksters that strolled about from market to market. 9He procured chariot-horses for his own use. He drove chariots in the garb of a professional charioteer,18 lived with gladiators, and conducted himself like a procurer's servant. Indeed, one would have believed him born rather to a life of infamy than to the high place to which Fortune advanced him. \\n3He degraded the most honourable either by insulting them directly or giving them offices far below their deserts. 4He was alluded to by actors as a man of depraved life, and he thereupon banished them so promptly that they did not again appear on the stage. 5He abandoned the war which his father had almost finished and submitted to the enemy's terms,23 and then he returned to Rome.24 6After he had come back to Rome he led the triumphal procession25 with Saoterus, his partner in depravity,a seated in his chariot, and from time to time he would turn around and kiss him openly, repeating this same performance even in the orchestra. 7And not only was he wont to drink until dawn and squander the resources of the Roman Empire, but in the evening he would ramble through taverns and brothels.26 8He sent out to rule the provinces men who were either his companions in crime or were recommended to him by criminals. 9He became so detested by the senate that he in his turn was moved with cruel passion for the destruction of that great order,27 and from having been despised he became bloodthirsty. \\nCommodus lived, rioting in the Palace amid banquets and in baths along with 300 concubines, gathered together for their beauty and chosen from both matrons and harlots, and with minions, also 300 in number, whom he had collected by force and by purchase indiscriminately from the common people and the nobles p277solely on the basis of bodily beauty. 5Meanwhile, dressed in the garb of an attendant at the sacrifice, he slaughtered the sacrificial victims. He fought in the arena with foils, but sometimes, with his chamberlains acting as gladiators, with sharpened swords. By this time Perennis had secured all the power for himself. 6He slew whomsoever he wished to slay, plundered a great number, violated every law, and put all the booty into his own pocket.41 7Commodus, for his part, killed his sister Lucilla, after banishing her to Capri. 8After debauching his other sisters, as it is said, he formed an amour with a cousin of his father,42 and even gave the name of his mother to one of his concubines. 9His wife,43 whom he caught in adultery, he drove from his house, then banished her, and later put her to death. 10By his orders his concubines were debauched before his own eyes, 11and he was not free from the disgrace of intimacy with young men, defiling every part of his body in dealings with persons of either sex. \\nThere is more info on the site I referred.

Yes, I support President Bush. He is doing a better job than anyone he ran against in either election could ever dream of doing. I think that it is unfair that people blame him for the false intelligence he received before going into Iraq. (I only hope that if a Democrat ever makes it back to the Oval Office, that all the "Government Conspiracy Theorists" will give that person's administration the same skepticism.) The fact of our situation now, that we are in Iraq, makes the false intelligence obsolete. I support Bush in "staying the course." I know that the Democrats' hearts are in the right place, but their planned troop redeployment could have devastating effects on our troops. Senator George Allen (Rep. VA) made a good point today during the Senate vote on the two proposals for troop redeployment when he said it is never good strategy to tell your enemies what you are going to do. That is the whole point, to me, against giving a time line on our troops in Iraq. If we broadcast to the insurgents the day we plan to leave, they will know that the day after that,  they can begin destroying all the hard work the Coalition forces and Iraqis have accomplished since the ousting of Saddam. The troops need to stay until the Iraqi government feels secure enough in its ability to defend its own people. One good thing could come out of the recent Congreesional debates over this issue. Hopefully someone within the Iraqi government was watching the debates. Both sides of both houses of the U.S. Congress stressed the importance of the Iraqis need to defend themselves. That is the key to troop removal. The people of Iraq need to realize that they have the opportunity to create a real democracy. The different sects need to stop squabbling and join together and build a secure Iraq together. They need to make it clear to the insurgents that they want to have their country back. It is up to the Iraqis to fight back against the terrorist element that is perpetuating the stay of Coalition forces.

the current policy of the DOT (department of Transportation) is to "allow" transportation of radio active waste or "spent" radioactive fuel in DOT approved tanks by rail or truck only. State policy also requires that such storage or transportation be escorted by police or private security and in the the case of crossing state line more than likely a military escort. Of course this would also be approved by all the counties that the transportation would enter. The best and safest way would be to let the military handle all handling of, storage and transportation. By truck, at night only.

FEDERAL - The government of the United States, established by the U.S. Constitution, is a federal republic of individual states. The laws of the United States are contained in Acts of Congress; administrative regulations, and judicial cases interpreting the statutes and regulations. The federal government has three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. Through a system of "checks and balances", each of these branches has some authority to act on its own, some authority to regulate the other two branches, and has some of its authority, in turn, regulated by one or two other branches.\\n\\nSTATE - In general, matters that lie entirely within state borders are the exclusive concern of state governments. These include internal communications; regulations relating to property, industry, business, and public utilities; the state criminal code; and working conditions within the state. Within this context, the federal government requires that state governments must be republican in form and that they adopt no laws that contradict or violate the federal Constitution or the laws and treaties of the United States.\\n\\nLOCAL - Local governments are administrative offices of an area smaller than a state. The term is used to contrast with offices at nation-state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government.

When considering the giants of Canadian politics, T.C. Douglas surely stands at the forefront. Tommy Douglas was a remarkable Canadian whose contributions have helped to shape our great nation. Although he is most famous as the founding father of Medicare, the most advanced health-care system in the world, Douglas’ contributions to Saskatchewan and Canada were tremendous. Douglas established democratic socialism as a mainstream in Canadian politics and his CCF government became the first socialist government in North America. A visionary who achieved his dreams, Douglas changed the face of Canadian politics. More importantly, Tommy Douglas was a politician who put the good of the people he represented first and foremost.\\n\\nTommy Clement Douglas was born on October 20, 1904 in Falkirk, Scotland. In 1911, Tommy, his mother and his sister moved to Winnipeg to join his father who had moved there the previous year. Shortly after settling in Winnipeg, Tommy was diagnosed with osteomyelitis in his right leg. Tommy’s family was not wealthy and subsequently his family could not pay for the best or most immediate treatment. The delay nearly cost Tommy his leg. This experience marked the beginning of Tommy’s quest for universal, public health care. By the time he was 18, Tommy set his sights on a career as a preacher.\\n\\nIn 1924, when Tommy reached 20 years of age, he enrolled at Brandon College in Manitoba. Brandon College, which was founded by the missionary Baptists of Ontario, provided young ministers with the opportunity to receive an educational background. In college, Tommy was active in elocution classes, drama, and debating. His peers accepted Douglas as a natural leader and scholar. During weekends and summer months, Tommy would speak at rural churches. At one such trip Tommy met Irma Dempsey, his future wife. By the time he had left Brandon College, Tommy had earned his Bachelor’s degree in the Faculty of Arts.\\n\\nIn the fall of 1929, Tommy became a minister at Calvary Baptist church in Weyburn, Saskatchewan. The town immediately opened its arms to the young preacher who possessed boundless energy and eloquence. His time in Weyburn allowed Douglas a first hand perspective of the harshness of the Depression in the prairies. Douglas knew that something had to be done for the common man. His experience with the vast unemployment and poverty transformed T.C. Douglas, the clergyman, into a social activist.\\n\\nBy 1932, Douglas helped organize an Independent Labour Party in Weyburn of which he became president. Saskatchewan’s Independent Labour movement was not large in numbers but they began raising awareness for socialist politics. The movement soon evolved into the Farmer Labour Party. The Farmer Labour Party offered hospital care for everyone on an equal basis, including unemployment insurance and universal pension. By July of 1932, the labour parties of the four western provinces formed an alliance under the name Cooperative Commonwealth Federation. The CCF became Canada’s first national socialist party. The Farmer Labour Party now had something it desperately lacked, the backing of a national movement. In 1934, Douglas made his first foray in the Saskatchewan provincial election. Although he lost, this sparked an internal flame which could not be extinguished.\\n\\nIn 1935, Douglas was elected into parliament under the CCF. This was a time of great turmoil for Canadian politics. Nearly all the provincial governments had been tossed out of office as Canadians turned to anyone who promised to lead them out of the troubled times. Along with Douglas, there were only four other members of the CCF caucus. At the tender age of 31, the young Douglas impressed the House of Commons with his fiery, yet relevant, speeches. The CCF, with only five seats, did not have much political clout, but that did not stop Douglas from fighting for legislation to support the western provinces. By the end of the 193 Os, the Depression and Worl

Sound actually passes through water pretty well--that's why Navies use sound to find submarines.  In general, lower frequency sounds travel further. I seem to remember reading once that humpback whale songs, which are at very low frequencies, can be heard across entire oceans, but I'm not sure that's true.\\n\\nYou might think sound doesn't penetrate through water well because sound does not move well from air to water (or vice versa). Sound tends to bounce off surfaces where materials of different densities meet. So, if you're underwater, it's very hard to hear things above water.
Stalin literally starved millions of his citizens to death, withholding and confiscating grains and other food. These were his ordinary citizens, most commonly the peasants, so religious denomination had nothing to do with it. In that time frame and location, most would have been greek orthodox. \\n\\nSome stats:\\n\\nEarly researchers of the number killed by Stalin's regime were forced to rely largely upon anecdotal evidence, and their estimates range as high as 60 million.[13][16] But with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, hard evidence from the Soviet archives finally became available, and such estimates became more difficult to sustain. For example, the archives record that about 800,000 prisoners were executed (for either political or criminal offences) under Stalin, while another 1.7 million died of privation[citation needed] or other causes in the Gulags and some 389,000 perished during kulak resettlement - a total of about 3 million victims.\\n\\nThus, while some archival researchers have posited the number of victims of Stalin's repressions to be no more than about 4 million in total [15][16][17], others believe the number to be considerably higher. Russian writer Vadim Erlikman,[18] for example, has made the following estimations: Executions 1.5 million, Gulag 5 million, Deportations 1.7 million (out of 7.5 million deported), and POW's and German civilians 1 million, for a total of about 9 million victims of repression.\\n\\nSome have also included the 6 to 8 million victims of the 1932-33 famine .[18][19][20] But again historians differ, this time as to whether or not the famine victims were purposive killings - as part of the campaign of repression against kulaks - or whether they were simply unintended victims of the struggle over forced collectivization.\\n\\n\\nEDIT: As for Stalin being a jew, you are quite incorrect.\\n\\n"Joseph Stalin was born Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili in Gori, Georgia, Russian Empire to Vissarion Dzhugashvili and Ekaterina Geladze. In 1913, he adopted the name Stalin, which is derived from the Russian stal’ (Russian: сталь) for "steel". His mother was born a serf."

It has ruined families, cause pain, loss, it has eroded out moral standing in the world and hasdegraded our self image of being a people concerned with justice and truth.  We now have to watch our people torture and kill all for the elite of this country and the sad part is the benefits for the people of this country are nothing, nothing.  The profits of those who would never serve is great.  So who loses, us and the Iraqis.

If you can answer (a) the rest should be easy. You can define an "effective mass" Me as the sum of the mass and inertia/r^2. This is the mass that is accelerated by m*g. Then a=m*g/Me. This can be checked by computing the forces needed for the translational and rotational accelerations; their sum should equal m*g:\\nf1=m*a\\nang.accel=a/r\\ntorque=ang.accel*I\\nf2=torque/r\\nf=f1+f2 \\nMy result was I=0.000095 kg-m^2, Me=9.3973 kg, a=0.12523 m/s^2. \\nChecking, f1=0.015027, f2=1.1618, f1+f2=m*g=1.1768

I have several friends in Melbourne, Perth, Sydney and Brisbane, and they have no trouble at all distinguishing Americans from the British. The American accents (even regional ones like Southern, New Yorker, Bostonian, and California) are very distinct, and with the widespread viewing of American films, no one from other countries seems to have any trouble picking an American accent out from the crowd.\\n\\nThey may have American accents down, but could a typical Australian tell the difference between a South Afrikaan, a Kiwi (aka New Zealander), an Irish, a British, a Scottish and a Welsh accent? ;-) Come on, Aussies!

The BIA? They are notoriously disorganized, mismanaged, and generally unhelpful. They have a disreputable history ever since their inception as a subgroup within the U.S. War Department. (Yes, that's where the BIA began.) They're currently facing lawsuits from many Native nations because of their incompetence in record-keeping and fund management. I often hear the BIA referred to in extremely negative terms by Native folks. I once asked a class (with some Native students in it) what the letters BIA stood for, and one Native student chimed in with "Bossing Indians Around." Personally, I thought he was right on target.\\n\\nNCAI? Extremely helpful, it seems to me. Mostly because it was started BY Native folks, FOR Native folks, in order to monitor the federal government, and inform the nations of federal legislation that was injurious to Native sovereignty and self-determination (termination policies, in particular). The NCAI is basically an umbrella coalition of nations that allows them to act in concert on issues of importance to Native peoples, like education, health care, the environment, housing, religious freedom, and sovereignty principles in general.\\n\\nThe NIGA -- well, it kind of depends on your stance on gaming. It is a non-profit organization designed to help Native nations that choose to use gaming as an economic tool. It's Native-run (mostly), and serves as an educational and legislative resource for these Nations. It's a critical source for nations that participate in gaming, and tries to help these nations preserve self-sufficiency by helping them negotiate the maze of gaming regulations, and establish non-exploitative working relationships with the non-Native corporations that finance initial investments. Even nations opposed to gaming recognize the need for such an advocacy and lobbying organization, though not all Native folks like the NIGA.

The biggest problem of the Flyers this year has been consistency.  With a healthy lineup intact and playing to their potential, they have shown themselves to be capable of beating any team in the league.  However, this has rarely been the case.  Injuries have devasted them.  Forsberg has missed a lot of time, along with Johnsson, Pitkanen, their leader Primeau just to name a few.  Even when their lineup was semi-back together, they still have failed to play the way they are capable most of the time.  One of the brighter points about the Flyers this year though has been the play of their rookies.  Mike Richards and Jeff Carter have played strong in their debut season.  Antero Niittymaki has been amazing.  Even R.J. Umberger, despite being clocked in game 1, has played very well.  Another thing that always seems to stick in my mind about this team is that, i hate to say it, they play stupid hockey.  Every game it seems they take dumb penalties on things that have been getting called all year.  They have not been able to adapt as well as some other teams to this "new nhl."\\nAs far as the playoffs so far have gone, game 1 was actually an amazing game.  Robert Esche was flat-out phenomenal.  Despite a lackluster performance by most other players out there, he almost singlehandidly kept them in contention.  I wish they could have won the game if only for the way Esche played.  Even Forsberg, despite an awful beginning, bounced back and showed why he's the best player in the world.  As far as game 2, i really don't even know what to say.  They simply got blown out.  It didn't even look like they were trying.  Buffalo's a fast team, but they have to expect that and be ready to play.  Moving on now to the future in game 3.  This time, they're coming back to philly.  Sure, they didn't get the split up in Buffalo like they would have liked, but they can still bounce back, its just there's almost no room for error.  Plus, the readdition of Keith Primeau to the lineup could provide the team with the spark it needs to get over the hump.  All it takes is a win in game 3, and the flyers will be right back in it.  In game 1, if only Sami Kapanen didn't hit that post in overtime, imagine where this series would be now...

The one side of the moon is always facing the earth, so when the moon rotates around the earth one time, it also spins on it's axis one time. It's probably called geosynchronous or something like that.\\n\\nThe moon also deviates up and down on the horizon, so we do see it's north and south poles a little more or less each time. I remember reading that we've actually seen 59% of the moon facing us.\\n\\nThe other side is called the "dark side" of the moon. But in fact it 'sees' the sun as much as the side that faces us. I guess it just 'dark' to us.
Your middle ear is responsible for your sense of balance. It is full of fluid, and when you spin around, it moves in a manner which is interpreted by your brain as meaning you are overbalancing, so you correct this by leaning the other way and actually overbalancing!!

Hi if you type into your browser "hearing voices mental health" You will get a whole range of sites to choose from which maybe of some help to you.  \\n\\nI work as a Senior within a care home for the elderly and they all have mental health issues.  \\n\\nThe term "hearing voices"....... they dont actually hear someone talking to them like you would hear me talking to you if i was stood infront of you.  They hear these voices in their inner ear.  The voice can be from someone they know (who maybe still alive) and from someone they have lost.  It can also be a voice of a complete stranger.  This is abit like when our consious self tells us within that something is wrong or that we need to do something, but for these people they hear it NOT as their own but as someone else telling them what to do or just talking in general.\\n\\nSome of my service users will spend hours holding a conversation with someone who isnt there.  They will even pause as if stopping to let the inner voice reply. Then continue as if answering them.\\n\\nI have recently completed a course on mental heath and I learned that even for something as simple as spotted flecks in a carpet can look competly different to someone suffering from mental health issues.  A few of our service users would bend over and reach for the floor trying to pick things up that werent there.  Even talking to the floor as if a small animal was there.  This I learned was because the flecks in the carpet didnt appear as flecks to them.  They saw it as something else and this all depended on the indiviual.  Weve recently had a new carpet laid now.\\n\\nIf your in thissort of work and not had previous experience your company should really be sending you on courses to help give you this knowledge.  People with mental health issues may see and there things but they are still very bright.  They will see themselves as being normal, and its YOU with the problem.\\n\\nSpeak to your emplyer about courses hun.  It must be very scarey for you at times.  Ive worked with mental health now for 4 years and im still learning new things everyday.\\n\\nAs abit of advice......dont turn it into a joke with someone if they start talking funny or telling you someones there its not likly to turn out very well.  You can try ASKING them who they see or hear.  You can sometimes understand them more if they feel you want to understand and can be trusted.  If you feel a moment is getting abit heated try and dirvert there attention somewhere else.  If your in their home on your own ALWAYS make sure you keep the exit door behind you.  NEVER let the client be between you and the door.  If a moment becomes above what you can handle or you feel you need some air then you can exit quietly and easily.\\n\\nAnything your worried about email me arabsaigold@hotmail.com.   I will be happy to help you ok

Just give the girl some time. That could mean a month or a year. But if she was engaged to this guy than she had to have some real serious feelings for him. If you really like this girl than stay by her and be the friend that she needs you to be right now. Even if you want more just give her the space that she is asking for.  You 2 may slip up every now and then and do something here and there but until she is ready to come out and say that she is ready to take that next step again than it will never work.  Just remember that you can only wait as long as your hart will let you. She is not the only one making the decision. You both have to make that choice and not have had anything to drink. Don't push it unless you want it to fail.

You should jog at a comfortable pace (you should be able to say a sentence semi-comfortably) for more than twenty minutes. Slow down if you need to. Stop if you have any chest pain. \\n\\nThe first 5 minutes or so are more of a warm-up: go a little slower at first, then increase your speed. Also, cool-down after your 20 minutes are up (start with a power walk and wind down to a good "mall pace"). Don't forget to stretch before and after a workout- it will make your workout more productive. \\n\\nAs for the workout itself, for the first 20 minutes, you're getting cardio benefits (aerobic exercise). After 20 minutes, you're in anaerobic exercise...you're no longer burning fat, but building muscle. Muscle will increase your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), which will increase the caloric need of your body...so it helps you to lose even more weight!\\n\\nAs for treadmills v. outside: it's a matter of person preference: \\nTreadmills:\\n   Advantages: help you keep up your pace, can vary terrain/incline to your preference, can see the calories you're burning \\n   Disadvantage: sometimes it can be more difficult to breathe indoors\\nOutside: \\n   Advantages: ever-changing scenery, cleaner air \\n   Disadvantage:less control over terrain/incline\\n\\n\\nEnergy requirements depend on the speed, duration, and incline of your workout, as well as your current health status.

Some argue that liberalism (capitalism) will bring people want to not only have choice in their goods and services but also in their governments.  This is not always the case, ironically, a state could continue to be authoritarian but accomodate liberalism.  In essence swinging from communism to fascism.  I think the chances of China moving towards democracy are greater than North Korea's.  However the Republic of Korea (South Korea) has its Sunshine Policy that ultimate seeks the reuniting of the two countries and if this occured, it would most certainly be a democracy.  Time will tell in those two countries.\\n\\n   As far as communism goes.  The idea is utopian and relies too much on the good will of human beings being their best all the time.  Unfortunately few are saints and this system of economics and government has proven to be a failure.

Here's the issue:  The finite mind has no hope of apprehending the infinite.  We can define space "\\n\\nMathematics. A set of elements or points satisfying specified geometric postulates: non-Euclidean space. \\nThe infinite extension of the three-dimensional region in which all matter exists. \\n\\nThe expanse in which the solar system, stars, and galaxies exist; the universe. \\nThe region of this expanse beyond Earth's atmosphere. \\n\\nAn extent or expanse of a surface or three-dimensional area: Water covered a large space at the end of the valley. \\nA blank or empty area: the spaces between words. \\nAn area provided for a particular purpose: a parking space. \\nReserved or available accommodation on a public transportation vehicle. \\n\\nA period or interval of time. \\nA little while: Let's rest for a space. \\nSufficient freedom from external pressure to develop or explore one's needs, interests, and individuality: “The need for personal space inevitably asserts itself” (Maggie Scarf). \\nMusic. One of the intervals between the lines of a staff. \\nPrinting. One of the blank pieces of type or other means used for separating words or characters. \\nOne of the intervals during the telegraphic transmission of a message when the key is open or not in contact. \\nBlank sections in printed material or broadcast time available for use by advertisers."\\n\\nThis is a defineable term because the finite mind percieves it as a finite entity with physical properties.  Space has a potential to either be filled or be empty.  Infinity cannot be bounded thus because it is unboundable and therefor indefineable.  If you were to ask is the universe infinite one could only, thoughtfully, respond "No".  This conclusion will be arrived at when the respondant considers that the universe has a definition applied to it and therefore a value that can be discussed and modeled.  You can discuss what is out side the universe, when the universe was created, etc.  Not so with infinity.  Infinity, as best I can discuss it (which is not very well as I am a finite being), is simultaneously all things existing and all things never existing.  The base problem with my definition is that "things" and "existence" are finite concepts fitting within the bounds of perception.  Infinity must be something other than that.  Are you beginning to see the issues with a discussion of infinity?  Try this one, "Infinity is all unthings non-existing".  that's the closest I can get.  Give it a shot.  But recognize that anything within the perceivable physical reality isn't infinite.

I don't know where the 0.07 Amps came from.  You can be killed by a whole lot less!  0.07A is 70 mA.  For perspective, the GFCI trip level is 4 to 6 mA, because more than that can kill you.

In HS, A linebacker often makes the defensive "play" calls for the team.

A LB generally is responsible for making tackles, and possibly covering the TE or RB out of the backfield on passing plays. They are also occassionally called on to Blitz...

The price probably won't get that high.\\n\\n1) Eventually Iraq's oil infrastructure will be up and running, which will cushion the market.\\n\\n2) Demand has to level off eventually. There just isn't enough capital to sustain prices even where they are now. People will have to find ways to conserve/alternate energy. That will mean prices level off.\\n\\n3) The big dogs like US, PRC, and Russia have enough soft power to lean on OPEC nations to increase production. They don't have to invade, they just have to threaten them with embargos and the like.\\n\\nEven if those three things don't do the trick, invasion won't actually help much.

The positives can be stained, the others can't. The staining possibility is an advantage for further research under a microscope. There is even more to it because Gram-positive bacteria belong to a separate phylum different from the Gram negatives.  The stain becomes possible by a high amount of peptidoglycan in the cell wall, which typically, but not always lacks the secondary membrane and lipopolysaccharide layer found in Gram-negative bacteria
Discs are thick gelatinous 'washers' between the bones in the vertebral column and act much like a shock absorber to prevent walking or running from jarring the brain (which is also protected by a liquid around the brain and spinal cord). Because of injury or simply aging, the discs wear and one side of the disc bulges outward. The shift in the weight distrubition causes pinching on nerves from the spinal cord and causes pain, numbness, or even loss of motility (as the pain can be overwhelming). For minor instances, bed rest and muscle relaxants and pain medication are used. However more serious events will bring the doctor to suggest fusing or joining the bones together. The operation is not very serious but would take weeks before the patient could return to normal activity. Fusing the bones does reduce flexibility somewhat but a small sacrifice compared to the pain and discomfort. Most of the disc problems occur in the lumbar region of the spine but sometimes can occur in the cervical region (neck). Sometimes a good back brace will provide some relief but it is important to learn good work habits in lifting objects (use the powerful muscles of the legs, not place stress on the back muscles and discs). Long hot baths will help to relax the back muscles but do nothing for the disc. Some people suggest chiropractors as an answer, and while they may do some good, I suggest an orthopaedic surgeon  to manage the problem. This problem is referred to as a 'slipped' disc or a herniated nucleated palposa or a bulging disc.

By a "slideshow" I am guessing that you will have a series of still pictures, with the band music in the background.  If so, a CD will work fine.    It's like a Kodak Picture -CD.  (If you had "movie" type video, a DVD would give a much higher quality picture.)\\n\\nReally, any type of CD will work fine.    I use CD-R  700MB.  They are relatively inexpensive, and no one can accidentally erase your slideshow or  write other data on top of it.   If there are differences between brands, I have not been able to detect it.   I usually use TDK.\\n\\nMost of the newer DVD players can read picture CD's so you can watch your slideshow on tv's too.\\n\\nHave fun!

The Wolverine's\\n\\nWe are noted for the following traits: \\n\\nStanding Our Ground \\nFierceness \\nElusiveness \\nCleverness \\nStrength \\nEndurance \\nCourage \\n\\nReal wolverines are so badass the football team can't even have the real ones on the side line in cages \\n\\nIn 1927, 10 wolverines were obtained from Alaska and placed in the Detroit Zoo. On big football days, two of these wolverines were brought to Michigan Stadium and carried around in cages. \\nHowever, the animals grew larger and more ferocious, and as Yost states, " It was obvious that Michigan mascots had designs on the Michigan men toting them, and those designs were no means friendly." Therefore the practice of bring wolverines into the stadium had to be discontinued after only one year. However, one of the wolverines was not returned to the zoo. Instead "Biff" was put in a cage at the University of Michigan Zoo where students were able to visit him at times. In 1937, the Chevrolet Motor Company donated a wolverine (as well as a cage to keep it in), to the University of Michigan. It was unclear how long this wolverine lasted, but it is known that no live wolverines have been in the stadium in the last half century. \\n\\n\\nIf a Wolverine was the size of a bear it would be the strongest animal on the planet.\\n\\nI know what you should absolutely not name your football team\\n\\nThe Spartans.... Sparta was the queen the ancient city was named after, her husband was the name of the whole territory. Do you really want to be thought of as someones little sister?...lol
First of all, I'm truly sorry for your loss. \\nSecondly, I think it largely depends upon whether or not you are the executor of his will, if he had one. My advice is to contact an "estate attorney" as soon as you can, if you haven't already. Even if you don't have to pay it back, you will most likely have a lot of paperwork to tackle, one way or the other- an attorney can really make it easier on you. Good luck- I will keep you in my prayers.

So what if the south won the war is the question here.\\n\\nWe'd be a farming nation and economically challenged socialist and less a world power than say Canada.   We'd still have slaves and there would be an active slave trade in the USA and likely the entire north and south america.   Counties would be run much differently and things like pigs and cattle would be much more important than they are now.

Your disability does not automatically qualify you as having been mentally incapacitated during the period in question.  Each state has a different definition of "mental incapacitation," but most will define it as something similar to "the inability to make decisions to which legal consequences may attach."  This can be due to an actual medical disability (a mentally retarded individual may be found to be mentally incapacitated), or it could be situational (the fit of rage rendered you unable to make rational decisions).  It could even be wholly unrelated to any mental condition whatsoever (a perfectly normal, mentally healthy 5-year old doesn't have the mental capacity to enter into a binding contract).\\n\\nIf you file your claim, and it is challenged as untimely, you will need medical evidence establishing that your particular disability qualified you as "mentally incapacitated" during the period at issue.  \\n\\nOn a wholly different note, most states have a Tort Claims Act that will require you to jump through various other hoops prior to filing a claim against a government entity.  Be sure to look into those requirements as well.
It really depends on the slave owner during that era. Some slaves were treated badly there is no doubt about that but you must also remember that there is always two sides to a coin.  Not all slave owners were horrible to the slaves. In fact at one point when the slaves were freed some actually stayed with there owners and became crop sharers. Continuing to do what they were doing prior to being freed. \\n\\nI live in the south and am very proud to be southern. I never owned a slave nor did any member of my ancestors in fact my grandmother worked along side the coloreds in the cotton fields less than 50 years ago.

Some of our states are bigger - and more populous - than some European countries. They have a lot more autonomy than shires and counties in the UK. They have different speed limits, different ages at which people can buy tobacco or alcohol, different ages at which people can drive automobiles. The death penalty is another example.

Do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT use a tanning OIL with an SPF of 4.  I learned the hard way that it's for middle-eastern men, not fair-skinned white girls.  An SPF 15 will still allow you to tan.  You can try an SPF 8 spray on if you don't burn easily, but again....don't go for anything lower than that.
Hold on a minute.  Rex Grossman has more touchdown passes than he does interceptions.  Granted, he has been playing subpar compared to the beginning of the season, but that's to be expected.  He's in his first year as a starting quarterback.  People are beginning to figure out how to play against him.  Once he learns to read defenses, he will be an excellent quarterback.  He has an amazing accurate arm; he just needs to learn to use it.  Give him time, and he'll be a great quarterback.\\n\\nAlso, the Bears are 9-2.  I don't see them getting rid of a quarterback that is leading the team with a record like that.  If anything, they should think about replacing Brian Urlacher because he's getting old and won't be nearly as good in 3 or 4 years.

They are actually Jor-El's underwear, which Superman wears to honor his late father & the entire Kryptonian race.  However, since no one wants to wear the same underwear that covered the junk that helped to conceive him, & have it pressed against his own junk, especially since his father's junk also touched his mother's junk, Superman decided to wear these outside his tights.  That way, he could honor his father, but not feel all dirty about it.\\nIn an ironic twist of fate, Superman saved a young girl during the 70s.  She, too, wondered about the underwear outside the clothes.  She also thought that was a very bold & inspiring fashion statement.  Therefore, she also decided when she got older, she would occasionally wear her underwear on the outside of her clothes to honor the Man of Steel who saved her life, on those rare occasions when she would wear any underwear.  Today, we know this woman as Madonna.
the way that someone dresses is the identity that they have decided to give off to the outside world. so yes, indeed clothing is a symbolic way for people to know how to treat one another.

This project will help you to make your own salt crystals.\\nWith few instructions and materials, you can make sparkling salt crystals in your home.\\n  \\n \\n  \\n Material and step by step instructions: \\nSalt is one of the materials that can form crystals. Crystallization is also a method of separation and purification of salt. You can use rock salt to make clear and pure salt crystals.  \\n\\nFormation and growth of crystals is a slow process. Formation of large salt crystals takes weeks or even months; however, small crystals can be formed in just a few days. In this project you may make different crystals and use them as a part of your display. In your report write what conditions makes a larger crystal.   \\nYou may also use salt crystals to construct varieties of different decorative objects.

It is a duty of a Moslem to give a contribution to the State. It is separate from the Jizya (poll tax that is levied on non-Moslems.\\n\\n"Zakat (Obligatory Charity) is one of the major 5 duties required by God from all the submitters (Muslims in Arabic). The others being the Shahada (declaration of faith), Salat (contact prayers), Fasting the month of Ramadan and Hajj (Pilgrimage to Mecca). "\\n\\n"The Jizya or poll tax is a personal tax levied on non-Moslems in a Moslem State, and as such it resembles the Zakat (Alms Tax) which is levied on Moslem citizens by the Moslem State. The poll tax is levied so that all the capable non-Moslem citizens of the State can contribute, each from his own money, to the general welfare of the State, and that in return for this, they can enjoy their rights as nationals of this State, including compensation from the Moslem Exchecquer when they are in need."\\n\\n(7:156)"My mercy encompasses all things, but I will specify it for the righteous who give Zakat" \\n\\n[3:134] "who give to charity during the good times, as well as the bad times."\\n\\n[6:141] " ……….. give the due alms (Zakat) on the day of harvest, and do not waste anything.

Babe Ruth. He was a pitcher for the Boston before he became a pernament outfielder and hitter. he wanted to be in the game everyday, so he worked on his hitting. when he was traded to the Yankees, he became one of the best home run hitters of all time. He has a carreer of 714 homers. he also has a record of hitting 60 homers in a season, but it has been broken by several players (Ex: Roger Maris, Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa). When he was still a pitcher, he was good. at one season, he was 18-8 (won 18, lost 8). He went 23–12, with a 1.75 ERA and 9 shutouts in 1916; the shutout mark is still tied for the best mark for an A.L. left hander. in 1917, he was 24-13 and he has an average of .325. he has a carreer of 94 wins, 46 losses, a  2.24 ERA, and 488 strike outs.

American here, but living in Australia, here's what I'm seeing over the last 5 years... \\nThe Australian media is spreading news of American companies doing harm to the Australian lifestyle. Let me give you a couple examples I heard on the news. 1. Dexter Shoe  company taking over the word "Ugg" for their boots. Now Australians have been calling ugg boots as such for decades and suddenly this US company comes along and bam, we can't say Ugg anymore. How unAustralian! 2. The FDA will not allow the importation of Vegemite, a top-selling spread aussies feed their kids, into the US. They said it was because it contained Folic Acid... thats a B vitamin that assists in cell reproduction within the body! Radio shows are putting up polls over here about it and callers are mad.\\nI'm always hearing comments... "stupid yanks", "arrogant Americans, they think they own the world". \\n\\nI love being American, but some US companies are embarrassing the hell out of me. Australia is all about giving everyone a "fair go". America is supposed to be the same, but they dont' seem to care whose toes they step on. There is too much ignorance about what goes on outside the US. It's taken me a long time to adjust to the idea that America isn't perfect. I found myself not liking asians... but why? Hollywood paints this portrait that asians ( based upon ww2 dated cartoons and movies) are lesser people and aren't worth our time. When I finally realized this programming within me I was appalled and saddened. \\nAs for the middle east... their hatred is mostly misdirected by their religious programming/preaching. Their religion is their world, like with most people, and those that are not of the same mind can only be "lesser beings" and not worth their respect. Sound familiar?

I guess it could be possible that sex could increase your glucose.... especially after ejaculation.  When you ejaculate there is a rush of epinephrine and norepinephrine (adrenaline).  This causes your heart to race, blood pressure to increase and also your liver to release glucose from glycogen.  I am assuming that you are a diabetic... for most people, sex does not alter blood sugar at all (because the body is very good at keeping blood sugar constant... that is, unless you are a diabetic).

Factoring is another method of solving the problem.  In your first example, you could write:\\n\\n0 = x^2 + 4x + 3\\n\\nwhich is equivalent to:\\n\\n0 = (x+1)(x+3)  <----  This is factoring the quadratic\\n\\nOnce you have it factored, you can solve the problem by setting either factor equal to 0, such as:\\n\\n0 = (x+1) which solves as x=(-1)\\n0 = (x+3) which solves as x=(-3)\\n\\nIf you plus -1 or -3 back into the original equation for X you'll see that they are indeed correct solutions.

Fast paced music has a tendency to stimulate the mind. (Auditory stimulus) it makes you think, gets your creativiy flowing, and is generally exciting overall. \\n\\nIf you get the chance to see the movie "Better Living Through Circuitry" (available on dvd) You will see musician BT discuss this.  in how it relates to humans on a tribal level.\\n\\nYou are probably smarter than the average person. most people just can't roll with fast paced music. That's not to say they are dummies. but most people into faster modes of music do tend to be brighter than most.
you can be bi... Its just what you like. Just cause you would have a 3 way with another girl, doesnt mean u have to have a relationship with a girl..

If you don't know what to do in the BIOS, you really shouldn't be in there. You can cause your computer to stop working completely by changing something in there.\\n\\nWhat you are looking for, IF the card is built-in, will be in the Integrated Devices list (may be called something else. Depends on the motherboard manufacturer).\\n\\nIf you get lost or make things worse, just set your BIOS to its default, and the command for that is usually listed at the bottom of the BIOS screen. The default is what you need, and the NIC is NEVER disabled by default.\\n\\nIf you NIC (network interface card or ethernet card) is disabled, then it is almost certainly disabled in Windows (software). Go to Start -> Control Panel -> Network Devices (or right-click Properties of Networking). Look for a disabled Local Area Connection in here, then right-click and select Enable.\\n\\nIf that still doesn't work, then there's something else wrong. It's either net NIC itself or a problem with your router or ISP.
you can call india but at this time they do not have a setup there.  I believe you can get the box and set it up but you will not have a india number.  You will have to get a us italy or EU number.

Prices range from $27.25-$47.25 at Ticketmaster.  I was lucky enough to get 3rd row seats during the presale for $47.25 each.  You can't beat that!  If you want good seats now, you might have to go through a ticket broker and pay anywhere from $90.00 to $250.00+ per ticket (like on http://www.tickets.org ) .  I hope you find the seats you want, for a cool price.  Have fun if you go!!!

My doc said within 2 weeks as far as protection goes.  I've been using for a year now.  But I never go 3 months without bleeding/spotting.

But its so much better than having a period every 28 days.  I love it.

MARRY RICH...
She loves you. And because she loves you she feels more free to do things with you. Maybe it's you. Hygine down below? Is it a jungle down there? Try trimming above the tree line and shaving below, ya follow? Showering an hour before sex is good also. Because a little walking and a flight of stairs or so is all it take for Big Jim and the Boys to get ripe. Hair and dark, warm areas are notorious for moisture and odor. (look at your arm pit) Here's something else that might be a contributing factor: the taste of your baby batter. If you take suppliments such as Ripfuel, or if you eat a lot of fast food or greasy foods. Or if your diet is high in saturated fats, you smoke and drink a lot, your yogurt will be toxic. Here's how to fix this: On Monday stop eating anything else other then Pineapples and water. That's right, you're now on a pineapple diet. The water will help clense your system and the pineapple will sweaten your taste. (( ladies, this works for you too )) By Saturday night after you've trimmed and shaved, showered and prepped yourself for lovin, tell her you've been doing something new to make things a little better for her down there. If she's a loving, caring, attentive wife she'll be atleast a little interested to see if there's a difference. If not and you unknowingly married an oral-hating wife (or she did the bait and switch by "loving it" when you two dated but "hated it" once you bought the farm) then you're stuck. At this point you should sit her down, explain all the trouble you went through and in a concerned and non-accusatory tone, discuss your desires and wishes for intimacy. (( Sometimes you have to give some oral to get some oral)) If she blows you off (and not the way you want her to) then you'll be at a crossroads of sorts with the left path leading to you just giving up any hopes of oral for the rest of your life or the right path to a girl on the side who has an oral fetish. Good luck!

Statistically, more men are hit by lighting, (only a percentage of whom die as a result, by the way), because men are more likely to hold jobs that are outdoor based, and are more likely to engage in outdoor activities.  Simply a sampling error based on who is available for the lightning to strike.
The binomial distribution can describe both ture and natural experiments. A natural experiment occurs when your dog knocks over your jar of coins, and some of the coins land heads up and some tails up. If your dog does this many thousands of times, most of the time the coin distribution will be close to 50% heads and 50% tails, but hardly ever exactly 50% if you have lots of coins. But on some days you will get 75% heads and 25% tails, of course much less frequently than close to 50%. The binomial distribution describes the number of days that you will get each different kind of heads-tails outcome.\\n\\nAs for ture experiments, you are on your own.

It sounds like you see through the spin and wordplay used to promote the  present united states government's quest to rule the world. Terrorist is a word used to describe a person or persons that uses force to influence with fear. I would have to say that the Bush administration is the biggest and most organized terrorist group in the world at the time. They rule with fear and that is their only hope for money and power that they wish. The american public is starting to wake up to this fact, but I think it is far too late for Iraq's sake and we have caused a lot of long term problems by going into that country.

the house of cards that this country has become is ready to tumble and the continued loss of manufacturing and production of food is putting us in the same position that destroyed Rome.

The speed of light is dependent on the medium in which it is traveling.  Light CAN be slowed down.\\n\\nIn a vacuum, light travels at exactly 299,792,458 m/s.  However, in other medius, like air or glass for example, light will slow down.  The more optically dense the medium , the more it slows down.  We can define a quanity, called the index of refraction (n), which will help us determine the speed of light in a substance.\\nThe higher the index of refraction, the slower light travels.\\n\\nThe velocity at which light propigates (v) is inversely proportional to the index of refraction (n).\\nv = c/n\\nwhere c is the speed of light in a vacuum.\\n\\nIn a perfect vacuum, the index of refraction is exactly 1.  Air has an index of refraction of just slightly above 1, but often, since it is so close, we can just round it off to be 1.  Glass however (depending on the type) can have much higher indexies of refraction, (~1.3 - 1.5 roughly).\\nWhen air moves from lower index of refraction to a higher index of refraction (or vice-versa) it is bent.  This bending of light is due to the fact that the light is slowing down as it enters the medium, which is the case in a prism.\\nDifferent wavelengths of light have different indexies of refraction, all wavelengths do not slow down equally.  This is the reason why blue light is bent more easily than red light and appear at opposite ends of the spectrum.\\n\\nLigh DOES slow down as it enters a more optically dense medium.

Pastors get paid...They do a job for the church usually under contract. (That's why most get a house, and other stuff to boot. It's part of the pay.) So when they get old and don't want to Pastor anymore they retire...It doesn't mean they don't preach anymore it just means they don't get paid for it.\\n\\nThe rest you mentioned usually do those things just because they want to. They don't get paid and are volunteers. They have a calling and decide to serve their chuch by contributing what they can. And no they don't retire but some just quit when they don't want to do it anymore or when they find a replacement or when they die. So they, in a sense, do retire at some point in one way or another.

I like bass fishing in cold water.  Here in middle Georgia lakes never freeze more than some skim ice, and that is unusual.  Usually the coldest water I fish is around 45 degrees, and most winters it will range from there to about 52.  These tactics have worked for me in that range of water temps over the years.  \\n\\n• Fish slowly. Bass slow down as the water cools.  They are less likely to hit a fast moving bait, so slow your presentation down and give them time to eat your bait.\\n\\n• Fish steeper banks.  In-Fisherman Magazine recommends fishing banks that have at least a 30 percent drop and 45 is better.  Bass like to move vertically in a short distance during the winter so bluff banks are good.\\n\\n•  Chose a bait you can keep in one place on the bottom.  A jig and pig is a classic bait for cold water. Crawl it slowly along and make it stop and twitch when you bump cover.  A jigging spoon moved up and down in one place works well.  Slow moving crankbaits and spinnerbaits slow rolled, or crawled, on the bottom are also good.\\n\\n•  Fish Deeper.  Bass tend to hold deep in the winter, so look for the ends of long points, steep bluff banks and creek channels.  They hold there until there are several warm days, then they move up into more shallow water.\\n\\n• Be patient.  Don't expect a lot of bites, but the ones you get may be big bass.  Take your time and wait on that one big bite.\\n\\n•  Dress for the weather.  You can't catch bass if you are miserable or if you can't stay out there.  Get warm clothes and layer so you can adjust.  Be sure you have something with you that will turn rain and stop the wind, too.\\n\\nI caught my biggest bass ever, a 9 pound, 7 ounce beauty, the second weekend in February a few years ago.  She hit a slow moving crankbait on a steep rocky point.  It was the only bite I got that day.  I caught my first 8 pound bass in a January tournament on a slowly moved crankbait.  I caught my second 8 pounder on a big spinnerbait crawled across the bottom, in a January tournament.  Both of them were also the only bites I got those days.\\n\\nGive winter bass fishing a try.

Barbie's friend and playset will help children to extend the imagination and learn to socialize with others in the real society.\\n\\nPopularity is just for market value, but imagination icon is for everyone.... agree? =)

I am a Powerseller on eBay, earning several thousands per month.\\n\\nBuying from garage sales and selling on eBay is fun, and good getting a few dollars here and there from ebay. Sometimes, you luck out on an item and hit big, but many times it will just be so-so (assuming you can even get the price you paid for it). In terms of fun factor, it is great. But from a business stand-point, it is not. Not sustainable.\\n\\nIf you want to earn serious money from eBay, you need to have a well-thought out business model. Selling on ebay is getting tougher -- just look at the number of auctions that closes without a bid. Go to the boards on ebay and you will hear even oldtimers complaining about how stiffer competition plus higher fees make it so much harder to sell on ebay.\\n\\nThe key success factor is: Sell products that people actually want. \\n\\nSelling on eBay is not as easy as some portray. In fact, go to eBay and check out the number of auctions that end without a single bid. Competition is getting tough, as more sellers go to eBay; even the big boys are joining in the eBay marketplace. Add to that the increasing listing and final value fees.\\n\\neBay has several ways for you to determine exactly what the hot items to sell on their marketplace: \\n\\nItems In Demand = the most popular items currently within that particular category. To see the In Demand page, go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/sellbycategory.html  \\n\\nHot Items by Category Report = a monthly report that lists the fastest growing categories on eBay for the previous month. Go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/whatshot.html and select "Hot Items by Category" from the menu on the left. \\n\\neBay Pulse = "a daily snapshot of current trends, hot picks, and cool stuff on eBay". Go to http://pulse.ebay.com/ to see eBay Pulse in action. \\n\\nMerchandising Calendar = eBay promotes specific categories on its home page each month. Savvy eBayers know that this home page exposure results in more interest in such categories. Go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/calendar.html  to view the current Merchandising Calendar.\\n\\nAs for items to sell, you can:\\n\\n1. Buy bulk liquidation items such as those at Liquidation.com. The capitalization may be big, but the idea is to sell the items individually and profit from it.\\n\\n2. Find manufacturers of items you want to sell and buy discounted items from them\\n\\n3. Make deals with retailers in your area, and offer to buy their unwanted items for deep discounts. jayandmarie - the most successful ebay sellers - made deals with music stores where they will buy the entire inventory in the discounted bins, and then sold the items on ebay for 1-cent starting bid.\\n\\n4. Look for possible partners on the Web, preferably outside of the US. Import items from them and sell them on ebay. There's huge profits to gain from this approach.\\n\\nI suggest you read the articles on Success with Auctions http://www.powerhomebiz.com/internet/auctions.htm

As I am sure you can appreicate, Northern China is a pretty big area, so if you don't mind I've centred on the city of Harbin (neat the border with Mongolia). Well, the first thing is "swings and roundabouts" and perhaps a place that should bid for a future Summer and Winter Olympics in the same year. In January, the average temperature is -26°C (in other words, frigid) and in July it can get as hot at 29°C leading to an annual range of 55°C and as for rainfall, well, it gets a good soaking in the summer but in the winter it's as dry as a desert.

Scientology doesn't believe that mental illnesses are real, not do they condone the use of medication for such disorders.  Take a look at what the Scientology founder said about the issue...\\n\\nFrom the Hubbard Communications Office Policy Letter of 14 Jan. 1969, "Thus in the case of Scientology Orgs [organizations] one should attack with the end view of taking over the whole field of mental health." "Our war has been forced to become, to take over absolutely the field of mental healing on the planet in all forms." "Our only justification in doing these things is that Scientology is the only game where everybody wins...." \\n\\nApparently they think that Scientology can cure mental illnesses...even though "they don't exist."\\n\\nWhatever.

A house we lived in during the mid 1970's was already 85 years old and people had died in it several times in all those years. Lots of unusual and strange things happened while living there. Also the house we just moved from last year had things happen in it. The first night there (only my husband and I) someone calling "Mom! Mom!" woke me up, but no one else was in the house. Also when I was taking my plate of food into the dinning room to eat, I glanced in the window and saw a reflection of a young man, looked to be about 20 or so. No one ever wore perfume or cologne or used any cleaning products with smells because of my asthma and every so often would get a heavy smell of like a man's after shave or cologne. Even people who were visiting would smell the after shave sometimes. And lots more stuff. The house was new when we bought and moved into it.

1st talk to family and friends about your problem and see if they know of any place you could get treated for your depression.\\n\\nIf you go to your doctor or any doctor for a 1-time fee, they can diagnose you with depression and then you can be eligible for Medicaid services, as I am, and they will pick up the bill for medications and psychiatric therapy as well.\\n\\nIf you can't do this for whatever reason, then you should go the natural way, i.e. buy St. John's Wort, Green Tea, and other natural aides for depression.\\n\\nCheck out these links for all-natural remedies for depression that are worth their cost.
I have heard that there are other means for obtaining stem cells without taking them from fetus's. They need to concentrate their research on doing that instead of killing something. In other words the ends do not justify the means. Think about it this way, if they abort a child how do we know if that kid isn't going to grow up someday to develop a cure for cancer or HIV. Another thing that I don't understand is the same people who agree with abortions and fetal stem cell research are the same ones who cry everytime they use a monkey for medical research. So I guess they thinks its ok to kill a human being, but not an animal. That is very twisted.\\nMy advice to you is get informed on the whole thing including the technical aspects and where they are with their research and then form your own opinion.

A bomb goes off in a marketplace in Jerusalem. A suicide bomber launches himself into a bus full of women and children in Tel Aviv. Foreign tourists get massacred at a holiday resort in Luxor, Egypt. Villages upon villages get annihilated in Algeria. The list of events worldwide which have come to symbolise the 'Islamic terror' are endless. From the times in the 70's and 80's when Pan Am and TWA aeroplanes would be highjacked, to the mid 80's in war torn Lebanon where Americans and Europeans would be held as hostages for years; all such incidents have come to be identified with the religion of Islam. Such incidents from past and present have undoubtedly affected Muslims worldwide and more so in the West. Any Muslim, who wants to practice his/her religion and expresses the pious desire to live under the banner of Islam, is labelled a fundamentalist or extremist. Any Muslim man who walks down a busy street in London or Paris (and Paris moreso) with a beard and a scarf on his head, is looked upon as being a terrorist who's probably got an AK47 stashed somewhere on his person. Muslim women who are veiled can't go anywhere in the Western world without being taunted as being oppressed or being mad (for covering up). However, are such beliefs and opinions about Islam really justified? \\n\\nExploding the myth \\n\\nOne of the many short comings which has arisen in the West, is judging Islam by the conduct of a minority of its people. By doing this, segments of Western society have deliberately played off the desperate actions of many Muslims, and have given it the name of Islam. Such behaviour is clearly not objective and seeks to distort the reality of Islam. For if such a thing was done - judge a religion by the conduct of its people - then we too could say that all Christianity is about is child molesting and homosexuality [1] whilst Hinduism was all about looting and breaking up mosques [2]. Generalising in such a manner is not seen as being objective, yet we find that the Western world is foremost in propagating this outlook on Islam. So what is the reality of Islam? How does one dispel the myths which have been created and spread so viciously? The only way to examine Islam is to simply examine its belief system. Look at its sources, the Qur'an and Sunna, and see what they have to say. This is the way to find the truth about what Islam says about terror, terrorism and terrorists. One who is sincerely searching for the truth, will do it no other way. The very name Islam comes from the Arabic root word 'salama' which means peace. Islam is a religion which is based upon achieving peace through the submission to the will of Allah. Thus, by this very simple linguistic definition, one can ascertain as to what the nature of this religion is. If such a religion is based on the notion of peace, then how is it that so many acts done by its adherents are contrary to peace? The answer is simple. Such actions, if not sanctioned by the religion, have no place with it. They are not Islamic and should not be thought of as Islamic. \\n\\nJihad \\n\\nThe word jihad sends shivers down the spines of many Westerners. They readily equate this term with violence and oppression. However, it must be said that the meaning of jihad, as a 'holy war', is something which is totally foreign and not from Islam. If anything, such a description belongs more so to Christianity and its adherents. It was terms like this which were used to justify the slaughter and pillage of towns and cities during the crusades by the Christians. By simply looking into the sources of Islam, one is able to know that the true meaning of jihad is to strive/make effort in the way of Allah. Thus striving in the way of Allah can be both peaceful and physical. The Prophet Muhammed (saws) said: \\n\\n"The best jihad is (by) the one who strives against his own self for Allah, The Mighty and Majestic" [3]\\n\\nIn the Qur'an, Allah also says:
I definately wouldn't think so! There are websites to go to  that interpret your dreams. Just try searching "dream interpretation"

It seems to me that, in the case of Christianity, you have to consider a couple of things:\\n\\nFirst, you base your spiritual belief on what YOU HEAR: "So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." Rom 10:17)\\n1 John 5:10 (King James Version)\\nKing James Version (KJV)\\n\\nThen, if you have faith, you'll have the withness IN YOURSELF:\\n"He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son." (1 John 5:10). This refers to the Holy Ghost. As a matter of fact, the HOLY GHOST is our source of spiritual knowledge:\\n"But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you." (John 14:26)\\n\\nThe Bible is the repository of the Word of God. It is a coded book, you need the "key" of faith and the  understanding given by the Holy Ghost to be able to "decode" the message in it.\\n\\nIn my opinion, it is the Holy Ghost who gives you assurance that what the Bible says is true... So although externally we base our spiritual belief on what the Bible says, the Holy Ghost tells us that what is in the Bible is true.\\n\\nPlease remember that some translations could be wrong, I believe that only the original scriptures are without errors. The Holy Ghost can guide us through all this errors to the Truth (if we let Him to teach us, I mean if we listen to Him).\\n\\nIN SUMMARY, I do base my spiritual beliefs on the Bible, but with the aid of the Holy Ghost, who guides me and teachs me what is true and what is not true about what I read from the different existing translations of the Bible, AND from the different interpretations that people (e.g. pastors) may have  on what the Bible says.
First off, I am sorry you are in that situation.  I was too, and I did marry that guy.  I do love my husband but we still don't get along any better. We were forced into marriage because I was pregnant and I had just left an abusive realtionship and wanted a steady thing.  Don't settle with someone just to settle down.  Sure the idea of a husband is nice, but what is the point if you can't get along?  Your happiness is of the utmost importance.  You need to sit down and have a talk with him about your feelings, he at least deserves that. He may feel the same way. Good Luck!

Intuition, it's a gut feeling you get, or as slight as an idea that comes to mind and when you respond something magic and cosmic happens. But it is not the same as thought that we interpret and analyze which inevitably ends up as some sort of logic. Logically intuition cannot exist but it does. I live in a society of intuitives. We work on an intuitive level. With our intuition we do things that benefit our lives and the lives of those around us. I will use myself as an example, for instance'; Ive been thinking about needing to meet with someone in the community. I may think off and on about what I would like to happen, I create scenarios in my mind, then without having thoughts in my head about the subject or person that needs to be involved with me, suddenly I somehow know that I must go and do, or go and be somewhere. I goe there and what do you know, the very person or situation that was required to fulfill my creative thought. I think it is thought that we pass between ourselves and even deeper and more mysterious. It's knowing that you need to be somewhere but your not sure why, and when you get there the cosmic happens and you are fulfilled. It's the shepherd suddenly knowing he needs to attend his flock, and when he arrives he finds the wolf at the gate. It's a mothers nagging feeling that her child needs her and if she learns to listen intuitively and responds on that initial feeling she finds herself correct 100% of the time. However, you may have the intuitive feeling about something, and you in your rationalizations decide to not repond or do something, perhaps even in a different way than you might have. Then the thing occurs and you say to yourself," why oh why didn't I listen!"  Intuition can save your life, and the lives of others. Learn to use it, cultivate it and rely on it because it will never fail you. It is your gaurdian angel whispering the secrets of life into your ear.
C = (5/9)(F - 32)\\nF = (9/5)C + 32\\n\\nor\\n\\nF = (9/5)(C + 40) - 40\\nC = (5/9)(F + 40) - 40\\n\\n(-40 F = -40 C)\\n\\nYou caught your own typo there. :-)\\n\\n527 F becomes (5/9)(567) - 40 = 5*63 - 40 = 315 - 40 = 275 C\\n275 C becomes (9/5)(315) - 40 = 9*63 - 40 = 567 - 40 = 527 F\\n\\n\\nAnyway, these are fairly straightforward to TRY to solve -- there is not necessarily a solution.  Another example where there is also a solution (method not shown there, but it is essentially the method used here) is my reply to:\\n\\nhttp://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=1006021800716\\n\\nLet F be 10^n d + [n-1 digit part called "x"]\\nthen C is 10 * [n-1 digit part called "x"] + d\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n(5/9)(10^n d + x + 40) - 40 = 10x + d\\n\\n(5/9)(10^n d + x + 40) = 10x + d + 40\\n10^n d + x + 40 = (9/5)(10x + d + 40)\\n10^n d + x + 40 = 18x + (9/5)d + 72\\n\\n(10^n - (9/5))d - 32 = 17x\\n\\nBecause of the fraction 9/5 there, we see that d must be divisible by 5: 0 or 5 -- But it is a leading digit and so it is not 0.  Therefore d = 5.\\n\\n(10^n - (9/5))5 - 32 = 17x\\n17x = 5*10^n - 9 - 32\\n17x = 5*10^n - 41\\n17x = 4999....999959\\n\\nFor example, with no interior 9's you have 17x = 459 yielding x = 27, giving your result 527 F = 275 C.\\n\\nOtherwise just keep dividing 17 into 4999....  Anytime you see a remainder of 4 you can stop the nine's and append that trailing 59 and then you will see that your quotient for x ends in 27.\\n\\nThe first time this happens is with 527 F => 275 C, the second time is with:\\n\\n17 :  49 yields 2 rem 15\\n17 : 159 yields 9 rem  6\\n17 :  69 yields 4 rem  1\\n17 :  19 yields 1 rem  2\\n17 :  29 yields 1 rem 12\\n17 : 129 yields 7 rem 10\\n17 : 109 yields 6 rem  7\\n17 :  79 yields 4 rem 11\\n17 : 119 yields 7 rem  0\\n17 :   9 yields 0 rem  9\\n17 :  99 yields 5 rem 14\\n17 : 149 yields 8 rem 13\\n17 : 139 yields 8 rem  3\\n17 :  39 yields 2 rem  5\\n17 :  59 yields 3 rem  8\\n17 :  89 yields 5 rem  4 <==\\n\\nand you could either stop here, or the next line will be 17 : 49 again, so x can be any number (0 or more) copies of 2941176470588235 yielding 5(2941176470588235)*27 as the F value and therefore (2941176470588235)*275 as the corresponding C value [the "*" means that the 2941176470588235 is repeated zero or more times]\\n\\nAs strings, where say (abc)^3 means abcabcabc then:\\n\\n5 (2941176470588235)^k 27 F = (2941176470588235)^k 275 C\\n\\nYou may also look up stuff about when 10 is a primitive root modulo a prime and/or about discrete logarithms modulo a not necessarily prime integer.

I'm sorry but why in the world would you want to be with somebody who told you they had a crush on somebody else. I know this hurts but sounds like either she's playing games with you or she's bringing this up to make you jealous but either way it's playing games. You need to tell her that you don't have time for games either she wants to be with you or she wants to move on because she don't need to be throwing up a crush and y'all just got back together. You need to tell her that life is all kinds of choices and she need to make the choice between you or her crush. Good Luck!

I searched for "Mennonite Halloween" on line, and came across a few individual congregations that were having youth parties, like other Christian denominations, on Halloween.  One group had this to say, and I thought it was a pretty good answer to your question:\\n"Many families celebrate Halloween but they often do so by having parties in their homes for children, or church youth groups plan special parties for the evening.  There are also Mennonite groups who believe that it is wrong to celebrate Halloween because they believe that it has evil connotations … the celebration of evil spirits, etc. Most conservative groups would not celebrate Halloween because they would consider it foolish and a “worldly” activity. "
Society is more open towards men being overtly sexual. I think most women on the whole are less sexual then men....and are encouraged to be less then they otherwise would be even further by cultural moores.  It's the same reason almost no women admit to touching themselves.  Most men have no problem admitting it.....even comparing techniques.  Personally I find honest women who are open about their sexuality a huge turn on....and women who like porn?  Hell yes!!!  I won't have to hide it when she comes over.  I don't think it's even that unusual for women to watch (although clearly less common then in men).

great question, ty. The history is clear. Neocons have long wanted the USA out of the UN. They do not support peaceful contact with other Nations. The Neocons always point to the fact that we pay the most. The truth is they do not want to share any power with anyone. They also have no interest in what the other countries think or say. Neocons like Bu$h think "my way or the highway". A UN peacekeeping force could be in Iraq now (no ours) but for giving up the power and the control of oil, the wealth and the Contracts.\\nThe Saudis are not stupid. When they felt Saddam was going to invade and control the oil, they got US tax payers to pay for the defense of the oil. Saddam was a Arab problem, Arabs got the US tax payers to solve the problem.  \\nWe also deal with the loss of life and money for our own people. The Saudis should pay the $6 billion per month in Iraq not USA tax payers.

FEDERAL - The government of the United States, established by the U.S. Constitution, is a federal republic of individual states. The laws of the United States are contained in Acts of Congress; administrative regulations, and judicial cases interpreting the statutes and regulations. The federal government has three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. Through a system of "checks and balances", each of these branches has some authority to act on its own, some authority to regulate the other two branches, and has some of its authority, in turn, regulated by one or two other branches.\\n\\nSTATE - In general, matters that lie entirely within state borders are the exclusive concern of state governments. These include internal communications; regulations relating to property, industry, business, and public utilities; the state criminal code; and working conditions within the state. Within this context, the federal government requires that state governments must be republican in form and that they adopt no laws that contradict or violate the federal Constitution or the laws and treaties of the United States.\\n\\nLOCAL - Local governments are administrative offices of an area smaller than a state. The term is used to contrast with offices at nation-state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government.

One, life is short, and being cool is important too. What's the point of living smart, but friendless when you only live one life? The WHOLE POINT OF LIFE IS TO HAVE FUN! That basically means you must acheive the perfects balance of popularity and brains. That balance however, is up to you to decide.
It seems that you are supposed to do this assignment, if it's your class.  I love phonetics though!\\n\\nEDIT: An experiment!  I see.  It might be hard to hear over Yahoo! Voice.  I probably don't qualify as a participant because I already know about phonetics.  As we say in my lab, "Do good science!"\\n\\nAdditional edit: I agree that over the phone is not a good option, since phones take out some high-frequency information that helps us to understand.  Are you not allowed to do your experiment in person?  Please forgive me for doubting you before.  I'd rather not participate myself, but I hope your career in linguistics is smashing!\\n\\nIf you're really hard up for participants, send me an e-mail in Yahoo! Answers.  I might reconsider.

Anywhere from 45-55 is normal, but in some rare cases it can start as early as the mid thirties.  You should check with your OB to be sure it isn't stress, diet, excersise, or weight related.
No question about it: defend your kid, tell your husband he must be mature and friendly; it's called child abuse. Let the kid be, they're always like that, is in their nature to be sloppy and lazzy, and it's wonderful he has good grades. Your husband is inmature, he's gonna ruin your son. If you don't believe me, ask your local social worker.
Im working in the cardiologist line, i can answer your questions.\\nYou have to see a cardiologist for a check up, most probably they will do tests like ECG (record ur hearbeat rhythm), Treadmill Stress Test (to see if you have the irregular heart beat during exercise too), Echocardiography/ultrasound of the heart ( to see if you have abnormal valves) and 24 hours Holter (just a smalll device attached on ur body 24 hrs to record ur heartbeatfor a day).\\n\\nArrhytmias (irregular heart beat) can be caused by several factors, but you are a young boy; so most likely it will be caused by Premature Atrial Complexes or Premature Ventricular Complexes;which is also known as skipped heart beat\\nIt has to do with the nerves in your heart muscle.\\n\\nIt could be inherited, trigger by stress, coffee and tea. Most of the time, its not a life threatening condition, but go and see a cardiologist is my advice. i can go on explaining more about your condition in details but it this answer will ended up so long.\\nI hope it help

I do agree with the verdict and think it was inevitable, but that is not to say that it doesn't make me feel a little sick that I'm sitting in the safety of my home looking at a man on tv who has just been told that he will hang in the next 60 days. It should never have been allowed to get this far, our governments should have stopped him decades ago, but instead they decided to sell him weapons, the area of accountability is a lot larger than it looks at first glance
i've never made out with a girl, but if i wern't in a serious relationship i'd try if the situation came up. just to find out the answer to that question( r girls better?), i've heard it a lot too. i really don't think the ability to kiss well is confined to one gender i think it's an individual thing. my bf's kisses are perfect but i've kissed some guys who needed a little work. i'm not sexually attracted to girls but i am comfortable enough to admit that there some hotties out there.

Rather than measure per minute it would be better to measure by game or by frame, or more accurately per ball thrown. The only workout will be getting up picking up your ball and chucking it down the alley. It will depend on how you do it too. An old guy will stand out there by the line, swing his body and let go. A young pro will stand with his heels dangling off the back taking 5 giant steps and grunting louder than a footabll cheerleader caught in a tackle as he hurks it out there at 25 miles an hour. \\n\\nYou can get someone to give you a table that shows estimates, but that estimate will vary wildly. Are there 5 people on your lane for that hour so they slowed you down, etc. \\n\\nHere is what I would do to estimate. Its 12 feet from the first dots or 15 feet from the second, those feet I do twice as much workout as normal walking cause I am carrying a 16 pound ball and walking funny. The rest of the feet from the seat to the ball and back I walk normal. I get about 4 strikes per game average so in 10 frames I throw 2 balls 6 times one ball 4 times. \\n\\nThe walking trips from:\\n the seat to the ball 15 ft\\n bowl is 12ft for me times 2\\n  the end back to the ball 12ft\\n  bowl again 12ft times 2\\n back to my seat 15ft alley plus 15ft to seat\\n\\n so either 69ft per strike or 105 ft per spare/open.\\n\\neach game then is 6*105+4*69= 906ft or about 1/6th a mile\\n\\nmy treadmill says I burned about 22 calories in a sixth of a mile, so that would be my estimate, 22 calories per game. \\n\\nIf the game is played with 5 people it will take about 50 minutes so thats about 10 minutes a game. If you are playing alone though you will have to go back to your seat between each frame for these calculations to work.\\n\\nSo that is about 2.2 calories a minute for me, but I am only active one minute of every 5 during my leaague. If my basal metabolic rate is 2400 calories per day, then I will burn an average of 1.6 calories a minute doing nothing. That average is skewed by the digesting of the food, and actually doing nothing in the bowling alley would be more like 1.2 calories per minute. \\n\\nSo when I bowl with my league I am burning 1.2 calories 4 of every 5 minutes and 2.2 calories the fifth minute for 150 minutes. I burn 210 calories while bowling, or an average of 1.4 calories per minute.\\n\\nIf you are there to workout try doing these things to make it a better workout....\\n\\nSit farther from the alley. The seats up behind the setee area where food and drink is served will get you walking farther.\\n\\nIf you don't care as much about the bowling as the workout take the whole 15 foot approach, have a high backswing and release the ball with as much velocity as you can. This will burn more.\\n\\nIf you do care about your bowling then add things like picking the ball up a couple of times, raise it up above your head as part of your "ritual" before you bowl, or take it back to your seat every third frame to clean it. This extra heaving around of the ball will take more energy.\\n\\nYou can also walk down to the other end of the alley when its not your turn to talk with friends there or just check out all the scores and other bowling styles while getting the extra walk. You can even try kegel exercises while in your seat. (yes that was a joke)\\n\\ngood luck bowling off those pounds!

Music participation provides a unique opportunity for literacy preparation. Whether the children are singing, playing, or listening, teachers direct them to listen and hear in new ways which exercises their aural discrimination. Playing instruments and adding movement to the lessons teaches children about sequential learning which is essential in reading comprehension. \\n \\nPlato once said that music “is a more potent instrument than any other for education”. You will find many teachers of young children who would agree with him. Recent research has found that music uses both sides of the brain, a fact that makes it valuable in all areas of development. Music affects the growth of a child’s brain academically, emotionally, physically and spiritually.\\n\\nMusic is academic. \\nFor some people, this is the primary reason for providing music lessons to their children. A recent study from the University of California found that music trains the brain for higher forms of thinking. Second graders who were given music lessons scored 27% higher on proportional math and fractions tests than children who received no special instruction. Research indicates that musical training permanently wires a young mind for enhanced performance.\\n\\nMusic is physical. \\nMusic can be described as a sport. Learning to sing and keep rhythm develops coordination. The air and wind power necessary to blow a flute, trumpet or saxophone promotes a healthy body.\\n\\nMusic is emotional.\\n Music is an art form. We are emotional beings and every child requires an artistic outlet. Music may be your child’s vehicle of expression.\\n\\nMusic is for life. \\nMost people can’t play soccer, or football at 70 or 80 years of age but they can sing. And they can play piano or some other instrument. Music is a gift you can give your child that will last their entire lives.

This is the site you want\\n\\nThe effect of 48 hours of water deprivation on the colonic temperature response to intrahypothalamic injection of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) was investigated in adult male rats. Water deprivation did not alter colonic temperature of rats at a neutral ambient temperature. Administration of PGE1 at doses of 50, 200 and 400 ng gave rise to a short latency dose dependent hyperthermia in both control and water deprived rats. Water deprived rats had significantly greater increases in colonic temperature following the two higher doses of PGE1. Control rats and water deprived rats exposed to the cold (5 degrees C) had decreases in colonic temperature which were not significantly different. Water deprivation, which should increase the plasma levels of the putative endogenous antipyretic vasopressin, does not attenuate PGE1 hyperthermia but has a slight enhancing effect. Following food deprivation for 48 hours rats had a slight but significantly greater increase in colonic temperature following intrahypothalamic injection of 200 ng PGE1. Thus the water deprivation induced change in responsiveness to PGE1 may be due to the decrease in food intake which accompanies water deprivation. The mechanism by which rats exhibit an enhanced febrile response to PGE1 administration following food or water deprivation is not yet known.

There is a diurnal pattern since plants also have oxygen-consuming metabolism. The morning has the least available oxygen because there has been no production during the darkness, but there sure has been consumption. The afternoon has the highest diurnal oxygen levels (assuming evenly spread cloud cover), as the setting sun will reach fewer plant surfaces than the midday sun. Come the darkness, only consumption remains, except for buffering in highly productive water bodies (which may build up an oxygen concentration greater than equilibrium with the air, and slowly return to equilibrium over night).

High Cascade Snowboard Camp V Windell's, the rivalry of the ages.  Well, personally I am a fan of MHSSC, Mount Hood Summer Ski Camp, however my friend, who competed in Oregon at the Paul Mitchell Progression Session and took first place in the nation, Tim Humphrey's has told me that both the on hill and off hill training at Windell's is far superior to that of HCSC.  I would have to say that being biased towards neither of those, I would have to say also that Windells has a far better name, and the coaching staff is much more renown than that of HCSC.  If you want to look into another camp though, MHSSC is the way to go man!

Mattias Johan Sundin (born February 13, 1971, Bromma, Stockholm) is a Swedish professional ice hockey player in the National Hockey League (NHL). A 1.95m (6 ft 5 in), 105 kg (231 pound) centre, he is the current captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs. He was named the 16th captain of the Maple Leafs in 1997, becoming the first European player to wear the Captain's "C" for the Leafs. His nickname in Sweden is "Sudden".\\n\\nOriginally drafted by the Quebec Nordiques with the first pick in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft (from the Swedish Elite League club Djurgården), Sundin was the first European in league draft history to be chosen with the first overall selection. On June 28th, 1994, Mats was traded by the Nordiques to Toronto in a blockbuster deal involving then-Leafs Captain Wendel Clark. Sundin has played his last 10 seasons for Toronto. Statistically, Sundin's best season came during the 1992-93 campaign with the Nordiques when he combined 47 goals with 67 assists for 114 points.\\n\\nHe has represented Team Sweden at various international competitions, such as the World Cup of Hockey and the Olympics, and has held the position of team captain for the national squad for the better part of the last decade. Sundin is widely recognized as one of the top players in the world in these international competitions, and has added a highly impressive list of accomplishments to his credentials as a result of his outstanding performance in the 2002 Winter Olympics and 2004 World Cup of Hockey. Sundin finally clinched a gold medal with Team Sweden in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin.

Most states have a penal code section for justifiable homicide.  You would be commiting homicide, you would just have to explain why you did it.  I am sure the kid would be a witness for you. Officers commit justifiable homicide when they kill someone in an officer involved shooting incident.  The issue you have however, is you're not a cop, therein you would have a harder time justifying why you used the amount of force you used.  I say, "you would have a harder time," because police officers are in use of force situations daily, therein, they deal with the use of force more often and can articulate their reasons for shooting a bad guy.  Nonetheless, even the officer would be represented by extremely well-trained council.

Hello Catherine, Your question is a very good one.Now,in the first molecule OF 2, all the valence electrons are used up in bonding and it forms a stable molecule having linear geometry. In the second molecule SCL 2 the same is happening and the molecule is linear in geometry.But, in the last one that is PF 5, the three valence electrons of Phosphorus are used up in bonding with Fluorine electrons,leaving two  electrons of Phosphorus as Lone-pairs,as a  result the molecule has a distorted geometry and the molecule has a Pyramidral shape like that of NH 3. I think I can able to make you understand.Bye.
I loved that movie and I thought she was a very down to earth girl, more of a girl next door type. I don't think she was using Chris, I think she had feelings for Chris but was afraid to show until the end.\\n\\nOh wait that was Jamie. Yes I though Samantha was using Chris. She was a real mean bi***.

I bet their love will not last forever coz both of them have their own history... \\n\\nBrad Pitt cheated on Jennifer Aniston while on the set filming with Angelina Jolie... So that's how they fall in love with each other... Besides, before he got married to Aniston, he also cheated on Gwyneth Paltrow eventhough they were already engaged at that time... So all I can say is I guess Brad Pitt likes to cheat on his girls when he's getting bored with them... Soon he will feel the same way too for Angelina Jolie...\\n\\nCheers... (^_^)

The Christian image could be improved by Christian families by displaying "family values" in public such as praying at the table before eating their food in restaurants.  You can tell a Christian by their acts of kindness, their acts of non rudeness.  They do not boast about their religion, but set a good example of being Christ like....not like Christ around other people.  They are just "darn nice people"!   When you are looking at a person who is really making you mad, picture them as though it were Christ's face and then see how you would answer them instead of what you were gonna do or say.  It's dramatically different than what you were thinking at first.  Jesus loves OUR ememies as much as He loves us.  That's all I can say about it right now.

I could understand your urge to meet him, but it may not be a good idea. Guessing you met online, it's quite risky going thousands of miles away to some place alone. Now, if you were visiting with your own folks to IL, ask him to visit and meet your family. Never alone! Just to scare you a li'l more: there are plenty of people (older) who'd assume the fake identity of a 15 year old boy, to allure some 16 year old girl from somewhere else to have her visit him. Kidnapping, rape even murders may occur following that. Well, you get the picture. I know this is awful, but this happens, and many a times unfortunately.

Wear chapstick with an SPF to prevent them because the sun can make them pop up. Also if you feel one coming, take an L-Lysine pill (often, as much as the bottle says to take) this also can be taken to prevent them. and try using a product called "abreva" its kind of expensive ($17) but works great. The trick is to use it asap because it speeds up the healing process. If they become a big problem try seeing a doctor, my sister used to get them all the time, since she saw a doctor, she prescribed her a strong medication and now she never gets them.

Using "straw" borrowers is illegal practice. You have the person, the one with bad credit bad income etc that wants to buy the house. They broker, real estate agent or even the person buying or selling the house recruits the "straw" to use their income, credit etc. They receive a profit from using this information. The reason this is illegal is because it is misrepresentation to the lender. No one is protected from financial loss because if the lender finds out you are doing this they can call the loan or foreclose on the property and all parties can be prosecuted under certain State laws against this practice and any monies exchanged or placed in escrow can be seized. This is considered mortgage fraud!!!!

OK- assuming this is a real spirit case and you are not crazy, the best thing you can do is not be afraid. He never hurt you before because you were never afraid before. It is like the movie Skeleton Key. Second: DO NOT TRY TO CONTACT HIM. You have no idea what you are doing, and you could get in way over your head in which case you could get hurt. I don't have an old family recipe for protection against spirits, so I could help you know more than a book or a google search on specifics, but there are plenty of books on protection. If you feel you need to call someone like a physic, but be aware that most are just frauds, and don't pay anything up front. I don't really have any better advice for you than that. Just don't fear him and he cannot harm you.
Leave it be for now and stay his friend. If he is with someone else, and ends up running between the two of you, you'll only end up hurt and may lose him as your friend. Bide your time, or if you really must, tell him - but don't act on it when hes with somebody else.
You date them both, get to know them better, and see where things go. Ya don't have to pick right now. Besides, they are online.

I take it for my thyroid also. I have PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrom) which has a lot of different symptoms, hypothyroidism is one of the symptoms. I have a book about PCOS that states that healthy diet and exercise along with weight loss can help control just about everything. In fact most people that change their lifestyle with better eating and exercising can go off of almost any medication. It lowers your blood pressure, makes your body absorb insulin better so a lot of diabetics are able to go off or decrease their meds, people with heart disease improve their chances of not having heart attacks with just 30 minutes of walking a day. I am on the journey to get off my meds. I take levothyroxine, hydrochlorothiazide and birth control (to regulate my periods mostly). It may take a while, but it will work! I feel pretty good on the drug. No side effects I can tell. Good luck!

In human anatomy, the vermiform appendix (or appendix, pl. appendices) is a blind ended tube connected to the cecum (or internationally, "caecum"). It develops embryologically from the cecum. The term vermiform comes from Latin and means "wormlike in appearance". The cecum is the first pouch-like structure of the colon. The appendix is near the junction of the small intestines and large intestines.\\n\\nCurrently, the function of the appendix, if any, remains controversial in the field of human physiology. It has been known to cause the ability to process bark, leaves and other things of that nature.\\n\\nThere have been cases of people who have been found, usually on laparoscopy or laparotomy, to have a congenital absence of their appendix. There have been no reports of impaired immune or gastrointestinal function in these people.\\n\\nOne explanation has been that the appendix is a vestigial structure with no current purpose.[citation needed] The appendix is thought to have descended from an organ in our distant herbivorous ancestors called the cecum (or caecum). The cecum is maintained in modern herbivores, where it houses the bacteria that digest cellulose, a chemically tough carbohydrate that these animals could not otherwise utilize. The human appendix contains no significant number of these bacteria, and cellulose is indigestible to us. It seems likely that the appendix lost this function before our ancestors became recognizably human.

all even numbers are divisable by 2 making all even numbers none prime.  2 is prime only because of the fact that the only whole number smaller than it is 1.  and using 1 in finding a prime number is part of it's defination that prime is only divisable by itself and 1.

Okay, first of all, let's differentiate between DNA replication, transcription and translation.\\n\\nDNA replication is the process whereby DNA makes an exact replica of itself. In this process, double stranded DNA is first unwound by the enzyme helicase, and each strand of the DNA serves as a template for the building of its complementary strand (at this point, free nucleotides are attached together in order to build the complementary strand - DNA polymerase is the enzyme that takes care of this). Afterwards, the enzyme ligase binds the two original strands to their two newly built complementary strands to give us 2 identical double stranded DNA.\\n\\nTranscription is the process whereby RNA is produced. As was the case with DNA replication, a double stranded DNA molecule is unwound, but this time only 1 strand gets its complenetary strand built, and that complementary strand becomes an RNA strand (remember that RNA is a single stranded molecule). Also important to note is the fact that for all A's on the single strand of DNA, we get U (uracil) on the RNA strand when the nucleotides are base pairing. \\n\\nTranslation is the process whereby RNA (or more specifically, mRNA, tRNA and rRNA) build a protein. All of the three different types of RNA I mentioned are made inside the nucleus. They then leave the nucleus through the nuclear pores and go to the ribosome. rRNA (ribosomal RNA) attaches to a ribosome and makes it function (the exact manner in whcih this is carried out is unknown - some say rRNA acts as an enzyme when it's attached to a ribosome).\\n\\nmRNA (messenger RNA) is carrying out the actual code to build the protein (i.e., it has the nucleotide bases - and as you should know, each three consecutive bases, also called a codon, code for a particular amino acid). mRNA attaches to the ribosome as well, and lastly, tRNA (transfer RNA) reads off the code on mRNA and goes into the cytoplasm to pick up the amino acid the mRNA codes for, and brings them back to the ribosome, where amino acids are attached together in the sequence that will yield the protein that is to be built.\\n\\nRemember that proteins are simply polymers of amino acids, that means proteins are made up of amino acids attached together - and the order in which the amino acids are attached together is peculiar to a particular protein.

OK I am an atheist, but I have spent a LONG time reading up about religion so I figured I could answer this question as well as anyone else.\\n\\nI guess this question is easier to answer if you believe Genesis as being absolutely true, in which case humans haven't existed for very long (despite all the evidence I must say!) in which case there were no ancient people as the human race started with Adam and Eve, both of whom knew of the existence of God.\\n\\nIf you believe that Christianity is an man-made 'invention', as you question suggests, then it doesn't matter about those before as its just make-believe anyway! \\n\\nAs for all the Christians out there who don't believe in Creationism then you need to re-read your bible with the understanding that it is 'the word of God'.

People are susceptible because people are afraid. Just like everything else in life, they are afraid of their bodies, their minds, their thoughts. When we grow up and realize that we don't have an infinite amount of time of this planet, people turn to what they have been taught. That there is a better life after death but you have to follow a path to get there. Therefore religion steps in and tries to turn your fear of death to faith instead giving hope. However, no one really knows what happens after we die so its a crap shoot.
i think if she seems very upset about the crumbling of her previous relationship , u might want to give her a bit, but if i looks like shes gonna be just fine, go for it. ask her out, and the worst that could happen is that she says no. and thats not that bad. most likely she will say yes though, right after an ended relationships girls are pretty emotional, so just be careful with her.
no. you would never get away with anything. everyone lies at some point in their life... it wouldnt be half as much fun if people knew you were lieing

Adidas, hands down. Nike product is crap! The shoes especially are crap. They only last a year - at best before they start falling apart.

If your wife wants you to spend all of your time with her, any kind of relationship, platonic or not, will affect the marriage.\\n\\nBy the way, platonic relationships are usually called friendships - I presume that this is what you meant, a buddy, female by your "extramarital" reference, to share interests with. Nothing wrong with it - most couples have at least some outside interests that are not shared, and spend time away from each other experiencing them with others (poker night and football games for example).\\n\\nHowever, it sounds like the differing interests are only a part of the problem... you listed a whole lot of other ones... but there must be something good if you stuck around for 22 years (power to you, by the way, you are beating averages hands down).\\n\\nWhen was the last time you two talked? Really talked - have you ever told her how you feel about the time spent together, sex life and else, in a way you would talk to a cherished friend, not someone you have to live with because you married them? Was she always like that? If not, where did the girl you fell in love with go, and why; and more importantly, can you two bring her back?\\n\\nI'd suggest to do some maintenance couples counseling, as a safe space to air out all the problems. If you just grow more apart, it's likely that your wife would sense this as a rejection - I can imagine this making her behave even more in the way you dislike, as she tries to fix or control the situation in the only way she knows.\\n\\nPeople in long term relationships sometimes stop communicating and start taking each other for granted. It's easy to get into set habits, and to reinforce each other weaknesses as well as the strengths (was married for 11 years, now divorced- that's part of what happened).\\n\\nFor example, the more independent "caretaker/protector" party can match with the more "clinging/dependent" one - both get something that they need out of it; but if the roles lose any flexibility it can be hard to get out of the worn-in track when the situation changes and there's need for readressing the identities.\\n\\nA good couples counselor can help with emotion management - both yours and your wife's, and could help you express to your wife your need for healthy independence, in a non-threatening way she can hear. Just doing "your thing" on one side and "doing time" with your wife will leave at least half of both of your lives less than happy. Hope you try for the whole thing :-).

I totally understand what you are saying and feel that if most people were faced with the same circumstances they would do the same thing. It is easy for people to judge when not in that situation and have such a good life here in our country. \\n\\nDon't judge any man until you have walked a mile in their shoes.\\n\\nAnd no one is saying that logically they can come here and break our laws and rob, steal, rape sell drugs etc because of their situations but what is the harm in them coming here to work? And it is true that Visa's are almost impossible to get.\\n\\nIt's not all cut & dry and that simple as people would like to think.

As a guy, I have experience in this.  When women talk, they are talking in a different language.  In my experience, women beat around the bush.  I don't know what kind of hints you are dropping but you need to be up front, direct. Give him some hints of what would be nice.  He may not realize what you are hinting to.  I know I never had a clue when I was being hinted to.  It took me several years.  Go to the book store and get Men are from Mars and Woman are from Venus.  It says allot.  I think I is a great book.  I am sure that there are several books that give you a little more insight on the male mind but that is a good start.  DON"T GIVE UP ON HIM.  Both of you need to sit down and discuss things keeping an open mind and promising that no matter what is said, you won't take offense to it.  It needs to be a conversation that will bring the two of you closer, not a conversation that will drive a stake into either of your hearts.  It is easy to think someone is picking up on your hints.....but sometimes the hints go unnoticed.  Good luck and don't give up. Have a honest conversation.  I have always said one thing to women I have tried to date.  "Tell me the good truth, tell me the bad truth, just tell me the truth".  I know I am a big boy and I would rather be hurt a little now than a lot later.  By the way, I am 38, in case you were wondering.   Mike
First start with DVD Decrypter, because if the disc gives you read errors at this point, it's probably either too scratched/scuffed to copy or has a new copy protection scheme.\\n\\nUsually, if a DVD movie works with DVD decryper and gives no read errors, you should be able to burn the disc without a hitch.\\n\\nIf the disc completes in DVD Decrypter, then open the files in DVD shrink and it should work.

Hi Cleopatra!\\n\\nFruit and veggies don't cause weight gain, eating more calories then  you burn does.  Thus, I suggest you keep to the 5 meals per day, but keep your total calorie intake to 1500.  Then stay active: dance, shop, walk, play, etc.  Simple rule, fruit has more calories than veggies, so error on that side.\\n\\nThe should get you started where you could start to see progress within the week if you stick to it.\\n\\nI believe this answers your question, but if not, you can shoot me an email at: gregg@leandownsite.com\\n\\nGood luck on your diet and fitness goals!\\n\\nTrainer Gregg\\nYou can achieve anything you set your mind on

here is what you do.\\n1) figure out every bill you have mtg/car/ins/gas/ i mean every thing you spend money on monthly.\\n2) figure out how much per month you and you husband bring in after taxes\\n3)what ever you just came up with per month spending add $600 to it for good measure.\\n4)figure out how much you would be spending per month on you second home taxes insurance and mortgage\\n5) now if all of you bills and debts per month equal about 50%  of you combined income you have the cash to get the home if it is more you will be soon in a financial bind unless you start cutting out those dinners and movies and you child's education.
If someone asks why do you accept this text as the word of God is it a religious question.?\\n\\n  * I think it is a question of faith or belief, not religion, since it is something I/you accept as true.\\n\\nOr is the religious question, Why should I accept this text as the word of God.\\n\\n  * Perhaps the religious question is actually \\n      "Is this text the word of God?" \\nand the response to that question is either belief, doubt, or a combination of both.  (Remember the man who said to Jesus, "I believe.  Help my unbelief."?)\\n\\nIs there a difference between why do YOU and why SHOULD I? \\n\\n  * Isn't it a difference of position?  If you already know something is true by means of your own training, tests, and thinking, but I don't know it yet, whether I SHOULD know it already depends upon my experience and age and training and education, etc.
It is likely they will ask you questions about what ways your mother is incapacitated. They may ask you about dates of when she became ill and stays in hospital. If it is about her finances then they may ask you questions about any income or savings. If your mother has been sent a letter about the tribunal then it's worth reading through that as it should outline what they might need to know and if you will need to take any documents along with you.\\n\\nThe important thing is not to be scared. They are used to dealing with people who are nervous and don't know what will be asked of them and you should feel free to ask for help or clarification if you need it during the tribunal.\\n\\nYou'll be fine.

I've personally thought of this question a lot of times, and I've come to the conclusion that the reason for the unwillingness of the west to declare war on the barbaric states in the middle east, is that we are a country of having our cake and eating it too.\\n\\nConsider that in world war two America and it's allies hated those Nazi's, Japs and, well I don't know what my grandpa's generation called the Italians. Meatball huckers perhaps? But back to the point, today it would be impossible to declare outright war on a rogue nation like North Korea, unless they attacked us first. \\n\\nOne of the reasons for that is because of the liberal rule that has gripped our nation for the past 5 decades. Because of that liberal rule many good changes have come: Civil Rights for blacks and other minorities that has almost erased racism from our thoughts. And, I guess, the liberation of women. Unfortunately, the one thing that prevents us from ridding ourselves of the left-wing thought of mind that, war is the worst thing for man-kind, is Political Correctness. Why? because political correctness' change of Englishes lexicon limits our thought.\\n\\nIt is a sad state when many great ideas are broken down because they are deemed politically incorrect or backward. I read a story in my local paper about a school trustee who was forced to resign because of the use of the word, "niggardly" in a briefing letter to other trustees. As many of us know niggardly is a adjective that means sad, or a mopey way of actions. But of course some people thought that this trustee, who had held his job for some time, was a hate monger and didn't deserve the honorable position of school trustee. I don't think I have to explain to you why this is bad for civilization, but to get to my point, and the answer to your question, I will anyways.\\n\\nIf you've ever read George Orwell's book "1984" you many be familiar with "Newspeak", which was the government sanctioned changing of the English language into newspeak. They did that in the book because while speaking English, you could form thoughts against the totalitarian government in "1984". But in Newspeak, it was impossible to form a dissenting thought or as the book calls it, "Thought Crime". I hope as you are reading this you are drawing parallels between "newspeak" and Political correctness, because there are no differences. Political correctness is the Lefts way of limiting our thought and freedom of speech. Consider how mentally disabled people used to be called, "retards" or "Mongoloids" which is just a waste of time, but has been done anyway. The same thing happens in "1984", when in English you could say," all men are equal" but in newspeak you cannot say that. If you did say all men are equal it wouldn't register as all men are equal in freedom, it would mean all men are equal in size. This is a startling comparison to the events of today's world and the Lefts control of our vocabulary.\\n\\nBut now I finally get to my point, we will never be able to declare war on the middle east, and it's most dangerous state, Persia, until we return to the thought of yesteryear, when you could say and do normal, orthodox things without fear of persecution. How do we get to this Utopian state? you get there by ridding ourselves of the cancer of politically correctness. The reason Islam has declared a holy war, or "Jihad" on the west is because they do not have the cancer of political correctness in their way of life. We cannot declare war on them because of the persecution of the liberals if we do. \\n\\nSo, in closing, we will probably never declare war on the middle east. That is unfortunate because the middle east and the Axis of evil consisting of Iran, Iraq and North Korea, is the most dangerous threat to out survival.\\n\\nIf you would like to know more on the dise

A train is moving from station A to station B; the distance between them is 10km.\\n\\nWhen the distance is 2m from station A, a man at station A will say that the train is 2km from A; whereas the man at B will say that the train is at 8km.\\n\\nTherefore, relative to man at A, the distance is 2km and relative to the man at B the distance is 8km.\\n\\nThis is called relativity.\\n\\nIn Physics we measure the quantities like mass, length and time.\\n\\nThese quantities can be measured in a laboratory which is at rest.\\n\\nThe same quantities can be measured in a laboratory which is set up in a fast moving train.\\n\\nWill the observations will be the same or different?\\n\\nThe theory of relativity deals about such things.

I actually impress people when I tell them the truth of my age. I am often asked my age at work, I am a server in a private upscale country club, for some reason these members are NOSY! I always reply with "how old do you think I am?" The most popular answer is 24. I smile and tell them I am 39. Their look of shock is priceless! I feel great being at the cusp of forty and would rather be 39 and look like I'm 24 rather than the other way around. It gets irritating sometimes as I am often carded, nah I'm lovin it!
The Bob commercials are not for Viagra, are they? I thought they were for some other form of medication. Did you know, if all the money, time & energy spent on trying to keep mens' d*%$s hard was to be spent on cancer or diabetes research & medicines, they probably could eliminate them?? All of the pills, potions, pumps, implants, etc - all of that stuff. Is any of it necessary? If an old fart can't get wood & finish the job, is that such a big loss? Men should just accept that it's a part of aging & let it go. But NO! we have to spend billions of dollars on penises & pleasure, while little children die from cancer & diabetes runs rampant. What's wrong with this picture? Sorry, didn't mean to rant & rave - it's just how I feel . . .

American here, but living in Australia, here's what I'm seeing over the last 5 years... \\nThe Australian media is spreading news of American companies doing harm to the Australian lifestyle. Let me give you a couple examples I heard on the news. 1. Dexter Shoe  company taking over the word "Ugg" for their boots. Now Australians have been calling ugg boots as such for decades and suddenly this US company comes along and bam, we can't say Ugg anymore. How unAustralian! 2. The FDA will not allow the importation of Vegemite, a top-selling spread aussies feed their kids, into the US. They said it was because it contained Folic Acid... thats a B vitamin that assists in cell reproduction within the body! Radio shows are putting up polls over here about it and callers are mad.\\nI'm always hearing comments... "stupid yanks", "arrogant Americans, they think they own the world". \\n\\nI love being American, but some US companies are embarrassing the hell out of me. Australia is all about giving everyone a "fair go". America is supposed to be the same, but they dont' seem to care whose toes they step on. There is too much ignorance about what goes on outside the US. It's taken me a long time to adjust to the idea that America isn't perfect. I found myself not liking asians... but why? Hollywood paints this portrait that asians ( based upon ww2 dated cartoons and movies) are lesser people and aren't worth our time. When I finally realized this programming within me I was appalled and saddened. \\nAs for the middle east... their hatred is mostly misdirected by their religious programming/preaching. Their religion is their world, like with most people, and those that are not of the same mind can only be "lesser beings" and not worth their respect. Sound familiar?
79 years old... and some more info....\\n\\n\\nJoseph Alois Ratzinger was born on 16 April, Holy Saturday, 1927 at Schulstraße 11, his parents' home in Marktl am Inn, an area of Germany. He was baptized the same day. He was the third and youngest child of Joseph Ratzinger, Sr., a police officer, and Maria Ratzinger (née Peintner). His mother's family was originally from South Tyrol. Pope Benedict XVI's brother, Georg Ratzinger, a priest and former director of the Regensburger Domspatzen choir, is still alive. His sister, Maria Ratzinger, who never married, managed Cardinal Ratzinger's household until her death in 1991. Their great-uncle was the German politician Georg Ratzinger.\\n\\n\\n\\nPope Benedict XVI (Latin: Benedictus PP. XVI; Italian: Benedetto XVI), born Joseph Alois Ratzinger on April 16, 1927 in Marktl am Inn, Bavaria, Germany) is the 265th and reigning Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, and as such, Sovereign of the Vatican City State.[1] He was elected on April 19, 2005 in a papal conclave, celebrated his Papal Inauguration Mass on April 24, 2005, and took possession of his cathedral, the Basilica of St. John Lateran, on May 7, 2005. Pope Benedict XVI has both German and Vatican citizenship. He succeeded Pope John Paul II, who died on April 2, 2005.
Tradition is a lame excuse to me as well. It is one of the reasons that I refuse to celebrate most holidays anymore. \\n\\nTake Christmas and Easter - both supposedly religeous holidays, but both have lost their meaning in American society - it is all about getting gifts...buying stuff and stimulating the economy. Hallmark has made a mockery of most holidays by inventing other holidays, just to sell more cards. \\n\\nTo me, tradition is only valuable if the meaning of what youre performing maintains its tradition. Doing something for the sake of tradition is lame, unless youre celebrating the original purpose... Even with Christmas, people might go to church that day when they dont go the rest of the year, but they are still missing out on the big picture.... \\n\\nThe term "rule of thumb" comes from the tradition of not being allowed to use a stick bigger than the thickness of your thumb to beat your wife with. Lucky thats no longer a tradition....
That question is not as straight-forward as you might imagine. Some states (like California where I practice) have "presumed father' and "putative father" statutes. Basically, any child born of a marriage is PRESUMED to be that of the husband. You can defeat that presumption in a number of ways. HOWEVER, the time limit for rebutting that presumption is short. In California, I believe it's two years. After that time, the presumed father becomes the legal father forever. After that two years has passed, you could have proof positive that you're not the father and it wouldn't do a d#mn bit of good.

Where to meet girls?\\n\\n\\nShopping Malls. Try to remember the last time you went to a mall. Can you possibly look in a direction and not spot a beautiful girl that you would like to seduce? I'd venture a guess and say no.\\n\\nThe malls are always full of girls. Girls who work at various stores and shops within the mall, but also a lot of girls who go shopping or just hang out. Girls love shopping. Though it is harder to seduce a girl if she is surrounded by her friends, it is not always the case.\\n\\nWalk up and down the halls and look inside stores for beautiful clerks or shoppers. If it is a women's clothing store or something feminine, even better. You can easily walk up to a girl (clerk or shopper) and ask her:\\n\\n"Excuse me. Would you be so kind to hold this up in front of you for a moment? It's my sister's birthday next week and you are about the same size as her and from what I can tell you have the same excellent fashion sense."\\n\\nBetter yet, after the initial approach you can even ask her if she sees anything else that she really likes in the store that your sister might like too because of the similar tastes in fashion. Probe for keywords why she likes certain things over the others etc.\\n\\nOnce you have sufficient information of not only what she likes but also why she likes it you can start your charm. Expand the conversation to likes and dislikes in other areas of her life to get her view on things and so on. If she's a shopper you might want to act very quickly to finding ways for you to continue your conversation somewhere else, but if she works there she won't mind spending the time with you especially if it's not very busy.\\n\\nLibraries. If there is one place that girls almost always outnumber guys, it has to be the library. Whether it's a public library or a college/university library, you will always find young girls trying to do research for a project or homework.\\n\\nThese girls are usually very intelligent and dedicated to their work, but the plain truth is the fact that everybody can use a break once in a while. If you provide a bit of a pleasant distraction they'll be more than happy to talk to you. You could be asking them for some help to locate a specific section or specialty book. Even if they can't help you out they will at least have to tell you that they don't know where you can find your book. But guess what? That is a conversation taking place right there. Ask them about their own work, interests, etc. Show interest, and let them talk about it for a while.\\n\\nThese girls like to show off their knowledge so they'll tell you more than you need to know about the subject. But if you develop good rapport at this stage you can easily continue this fascinating conversation elsewhere. Get my drift? You can start asking why they're interested in this particular subject, what's the most fascinating thing about it, what are the challenges and so on. Once you move to answering this type of questions then you will be able to get an insight as to what type of girl she is, what she holds dear and so on.\\n\\nGourmet Coffee Shops. Before work, at lunch and after work these places are packed with girls. Sometimes the more packed the place, the better because you may have to share a table with "someone". If it's not very busy you can still ask to sit next to a beautiful girl. Just tell her that you don't like to sit alone and if she'd mind you sitting with her till you're done with your drink.\\n\\nIf you're sitting together might as well talk about something. And remember this is a gourmet coffee shop. These girls don't come here for the coffee, they come here for the specialty coffee, and they come for the frills and sometimes even the prestige associated with a particular specialty coffee shop.\\n\\nSo what do you talk about?\\n\\nHer favorite drink and why she likes it over regular coffee, how does it make her feel and

If you want a good sound when you are finished, I can think of only one way.  What you need is called a multi-track recorder.  You could search ebay for 4-track or 8-track recorders or "studio recorders".  What such a device will do is split the tape into 4 or 8 sections... each of which carries its own information.  For example, track-one might carry the drums recording, track-2 might have the bass-guitar recording, track-3 might include your media sample at the proper time...etc  (you get the idea).\\n\\n   When you have your tracks recorded, such a machine will output everything together to a line-out jack (usually a mini-plug like headphones, but sometimes a 1/4'' plug).  You can then record it all to one track of tape, cd, mp3, or whatever you can plug it into.\\n\\nNow, studio recorders used to be pretty expensive, but as computers have taken over their role in large part, you can often find used ones pretty cheap.  As I suggested, try ebay.  You may also find that a small local recording studio will do the mix for you for a small fee.\\n\\nI hope this helps you.
OOH when he broke up with her he would go out with you. please girl you don't need that why wait for a dead beat cheater. What makes him so god damn special.

Okay, everyone sure makes great points. However, I truly disagree!! I am Canadian and do not support the anti-immigration measures. I have family members that are illegals, canadian illegals- that is- but they are still illegals. ( So why is everyone so focused on MEXICANs- take geograpgy lessons, many come from el salvador, costa rica and so many other places.!)Granted, people can say: well yea, but what about the sleeping giant of 11,000,000 illegals.. I say GET OVER IT!! i do not think any one should have the privellage 2 come over here but please whether people are citizens of a country, residents or even an immigrant they are all still HUMAN BEINGS!! Oh and by the way.. to the ignorent people; before prop 100 passed, regardless if illegal immagrants did pay bond they were not let out of jail to await trial. IDIOTS!!!!! They then were handed over to INS which then kept them and did whatever they wanted with them, then finally they were deported back to Mexico! ( and the bond that they paid was FREE money that went back into the jail systems anyways!

I have dated people from different races and have always been opened to learning how everyone view themselves in society.  Being African American and brought up in a christian home we were taught about "unconditional love".  When we get to heaven there is no black section or white section but all people section.  God is a artist, He created many things different and with beautiful color and contrasts.  Look at people and you should see the canvas God used to create such masterpieces.
It depends upon the agency.  Under the 'frequently asked questions' of the CIA for example, a marriage or relationship with a foreign national may affect security processing or eligibility to receive a security clearance.\\n\\n"The agency is required to consider its applicant's relationship with foreign nationals.  The particular concern is if any member of an applicant's family is a citizen of a foreign country.  At the Agency, if the applicant's spouse, intended spouse, or live-in relationship is not a citizen of the US, the Agency will perform security screening of this individual as part of the applicant's security processing.  The foreign national will be asked to sign an authorization for release of information, provide biographic data for a a background investigation, and undergo a polygraph examination.  Furthermore, a condition of employment for Agency employees is that their foreign national spouses et al, must agree to become a naturalized US citizen as soon as eligible under standard immigration procedures.  The Agency will render a decision to hire an applicant only after both the applicant and the foreign national favorably complete security processing."

You need to ask each school what their graduatuation rate is.  I don't know if EEs take a national licensing exam but it seems reasonable, so find out what each school's pass rate is.  The higher results belong to the school you want to go to.  Also consider expenses, tuition and living.  Then make your own decision instead of relying on what other people say.  After all, you will be the one attending.

I would say it is not common for woman to urinate during a climax. What you might think is urination, could be an orgasm. Some females will squirt during their orgasm, but this is usually about 5-10 ml. Some maybe a little more, but not much. If you are passing more than say a big table spoon then you need to go and get checked out by your doctor. \\n\\nWeak bladder can cause this, but like I said, its not common. Hope this helps out, kind of hard to diagnose over the Internet cause lab tests and exams are a key part of it.

The whole thing started because Cruz would flip the Germans off (he would kiss his outstretched middle finger) after every single Argentinian penalty kick that went in. Borroski (GER) did the same after his penalty kick and it pissed the players off even more when they lost. The unused substitute Leandro Cufre (ARG) got his tall blond German players mixed-up and ended up kicking Per Mertesacker (GER) in the crotch after his team lost, thereby starting the brawl on the field. Oliver Beerhoff was trying to shield his players after Mertesacker went down and ended up getting some of the Argentinian frustration focused on him. \\n\\nhttp://www.bild.t-online.de/BTO/sport/wm2006/aktuell/07/01/pruegel-gauchos/pruegel-gauchos.html

if you want a proof, here's one by calculus\\nwhen the cone is positioned upright, standing on its tip we can find the center of mass by the formulas\\n x' = ∫(x*da)/∫(da)\\n y' = ∫(y*da)/∫(da) \\n---with the limits from\\n x = 0 to x = b(base) \\n y = 0 to y = h(height)\\n\\nby intuition center of mass along x = 0\\n\\nwe can represent the equation of the cone as y = mx, where m is the slope\\n\\nso finding the center of mass along y we find\\n∫yda = ∫y*2πxdy, since da=2πxdy from infinitesimal area A = 2πrh\\n = 2π∫(y^2)dy/m\\n = 2π(y^3)/3m evaluated from 0 to h\\n = 2πh^3/3m, we can find m from y = mx ---> h = mb so m=h/b\\n = 2πb(h^2)/3\\n\\nthen we have to find ∫da\\n∫da = ∫2πxdy\\n = ∫2πydy / m\\n = π(h^2)/m\\n = πbh\\n\\nso y' = ∫(y*da)/∫(da) = 2πb(h^2)/3πbh = 2h/3\\nthis means the center of mass along the vertical axis of the cone is 2h/3 when the cone is STANDING ON ITS TIP\\ny = 2h/3 and x = 0

80% of taste is smell.  We only have 5 types of taste buds: sweet, sour, bitter, salt, and umami (new one just dicovered that responds to an amino acid high in beef).  Life would be pretty boring if that was all we tasted.  Meanwhile we can smell about 10,000 different things, so your tastebuds and olfacory receptors work together.  Unless your olfactory receptors are covered in mucous!  I find that I use a lot more salt when I'm stuffy, probably because I can taste that.
Well, how about using birth control like we are allowed to do?  Condoms are allowed.  God cares about our health, which is why he prohibited us from drinking and eating certain things.  For example, a woman just has a baby.  Right away, she gets pregnant again and that baby is born sickly and has many problems.  Right after that baby, another is born with even more problems.  Islam says we can not harm one another and we can not harm ourselves.  Women need time to recover from childbirth, and it's in the best interest of the next child so that it will be healthy and strong.  The mother also needs to get her strength back.  So, islamically, condoms are allowed.\\n\\nIf you are HIV positive, I think you should tell your spouse and get a divorce.  Don't take the chance of passing this on to him/her or your children.

Kwanzaa (Kwaanza) is a week-long secular holiday honoring African-American heritage, observed from December 26 to January 1 each year, almost exclusively by African-Americans in the United States of America, though Africans of the diaspora in many countries have begun to practice its observances as well.\\n\\nKwanzaa consists of seven days of celebration, featuring activities such as candle-lighting and pouring of libations, and culminating in a feast and gift-giving. It was founded by black nationalist Dr. Ron "Maulana" Karenga, and first celebrated from December 26, 1966, to January 1, 1967. Karenga calls Kwanzaa the African American branch of "first fruits" celebrations of classical African cultures.

A great source of protein is hard boiled eggs, but just eat the white. Give the yolk to your dog or cat. That way you avoid the fat and cholesterol. Or make scrambled eggs and before cooking separate out the yolk and just use mostly whites, with maybe just one yolk. Lean fish and chicken are great, too, and if you can afford it, buy organic and all-natural meat. You still need to balance it out with fresh green and yellow vegetables, fresh fruit, whole grains (like oatmeal, whole-grain bread, brown rice, etc) for a balanced diet.

The terminology is at fault due to convention here.  When we say 'weight' in terms of how fat we are, we actually are measuring mass when se state it in kg or pounds and stone.  Sticking to the SI system of units (kg), we use Newtons 2nd law of motion:\\n\\nF=m.a\\n\\nHere: F is the force in Newtons\\n      m is the 'mass' of the subject\\n      a is the acceleration field the mass experiences.\\n\\nThe accelerating field here on Earth is typically 9.81m/s/s.  Thats the gravitational acceleration due to the cumlative effect of the earths mass.  However, many people round this figure reasonably up to 10 m/s/s.  This in turn means that a mass of 1 kg would result in a force of 10 Newtons here on Earth (using the 10 m/s/s) approx).  Therefore your 'mass' of 70 kg would have a force of 700 Newtons here on Earth.\\n\\nTypically we take the Earths acceleration field due to gravity for granted and thus refer to all mass measurements on Earth as 'weight'.\\n\\nTherefore, to summarize, on Earth, your mass is 70 kg, its weight is 700N and its effective force due to the earths gravitational field is also 700 N.\\n\\nGet confusing.. its got good reasoning in physics to be refered to as mass rather than the inaccurate weight.\\n\\nHope that helped.

Well, google "smoking benefits" and there are a couple pages. Apparently smoking is associated with lowered risks of Parkinsons and Alzheimers and certain types of cancer. Nicotine can be  therapeutic for schizophrenia. And of course, there are the immediate benefits of smoking, which are the reasons people do it: pleasure, mental stimulation / mood lift, weight loss / maintaining a lower weight.
Because their preachers and pastors try to entice them into hatred for other religions and cultures so that they dont' deviate away from Christianity. Doing so, ensures that the pastors keep getting their follower's money and living lives that are far from humble. Don't believe me? Look at the most prominent telavangelists on TV and look at their homes and lifestyle. They all have atleast $1,000,000 in the bank, and drive nice sports cars; which they could of used the money instead to help the needy instead of being greedy.\\n\\nThe Bible states that all sins carries the same weight, and yet you see Christians bashing gays, and promoting the lies of Santa Claus and Easter Bunny to their kids. Ironic, isn't it?

First boyfriend--found out he had cheated on me after I broke up with him for slapping me.  I met other girls he'd slept with or, as in my case, come close to it with and pressured.

His dating career was over until he moved.\\n\\nThird boyfriend--cheated on me.  Flagrantly and often.  I was 17.

You have two options, network, or plug and play.\\n\\nFor networking, it takes more time to setup though may be more efficient in the long run.

Just install the printer driver on both your computers and plug the USB connection to the computer you want to print from. The downside to this method is that both your computers and printer have to be located close to each other.
Percentile is supposed to mean the percent of all the people who took the test that you scored HIGHER than.  Since you can't score higher that yourself your percentile shouldn't be 100.

Faithfull and truthfulness go hand in hand.  A relationship is based on some of these factors.  If you can be promiscuous then you have not learned and experience true love yourself.

You are living a lie and you are also endangering hers.  Be sure, be positive and be sincere.  Then talk about love.

It depends. Some banks, instead of sending back your checks with every statement, send only copies of the checks, and this may include all checks deposited to the account.  If you go online and look at the statement, you can click on any line item on the statement and it will bring up an image of that item, front and back.  If Chase does that then yes, by going into the online statement and clicking on any item she will be able to see an image of that item.\\n\\nIf the deposit item in question is a check drawn on a local bank, you may be able to go to that bank and cash it, then take the cash and make a cash deposit into your joint checking account.  This way all your mom can see is a cash deposit.  if you don't even want her to see the cash, and need to pay some bills, take the cash and go to the post office and buy money orders for the amounts of the bills you need to pay, and send the money orders as payments.  This way, your mom will not see any deposit at all, or at most a very much reduced one.\\n\\nI used to do all this to keep it looking like I had no income and no deposits to my checking account.  Once I went to the post office and bought a total of $5,000 in a whole bunch of money orders, and only $300 or so actually made it as cash into my checking account.  For all intents and purposes if you looked at my checking account it looked like I was dead broke and in abject poverty.

Cardinals serve for life, but can only vote for a new Pope if they are younger than 80 years old.\\n\\nSo to answer your questions in order...\\n\\n1. Nothing\\n2.  No...they serve for life\\n3.  No...there are almost 200 of them.\\n4.  No, all cardinals under the age of 80 will be responsible for voting in the next pope.  There are 193 Cardinals and 120 of them are under 80 right now.\\n\\nThe next Pope won't necessarily be the 17th. The last one was the second (John Paul II).  If that Pope chooses the name of Benedict, (yes, they choose their own names) then he would be the 17th.  Otherwise, he will either be John Paul III or John the 27th or Peter II, depending what he chooses.

It depends, and it isn't just because of gravity....granted that determines that there is a landslide but it could be because of water seepage, causing the land mass to "Slump", also they can happen because of volcanoes that spew out so much lava that there is a huge chasm underneath where it used to be causing the cliff/mountain to just collapse. They don't just happen in one specific area. Although mountainous regions is always a good place to find them.
The enemy here is the pharmaceutical companies. They do not want the competition from Pot.

I really feel for you and wish you didn't have to suffer as you do. Seeing that you are so ill you will think our government would have the compassion to allow you to be treated with what works. Once again Big Brother intrudes.

OK, best as I can figure it out, there's this doctor working on trying to find a cure for his wife's tumor. She writes a book (except for the ending) about the Queen of Spain, a Conquistador and the Tree of Life. The doctor's unconscious (or "higher self") becomes obsessed with the idea of renewal, rebirth, etc. so he's fantasizing (dreaming) about being in a bubble and heading towards the nebula that's supposed to bring renewal and rebirth, thinking if he can save the tree of life (which has hairs on it like his wife Izzie has on her neck) then he can save Izzie.\\n\\nHe fails in saving Izzie and regrets not having gone with her to walk in the snow when she invited him so he imagines that he did walk with her and that he visits her grve and plants an acorn which will grow out of her just as the tree of life grew out of 1st father.\\n\\nI don't think we were actually supposed to understand it but just sit back and enjoy the cinematography!

The 23 special wards that make up what is considered Tokyo proper have a population (1997) of 7,830,323 . Tokyo Metropolis extends to the west of the central city and has a population of 11,680,490 (1999). Most of the difference in population is concentrated in the Tama district, which is on the western border of Tokyo. The western reaches of the Tama district and the islands are lightly populated. The population of Tokyo Metropolis peaked in 1987 at about 11,917,000. There has been a decline since then, particularly in the central wards where high land costs and expansion of commercial centers have reduced residential land. Suburban areas in the Tama district and in neighboring prefectures (Kanagawa, Chiba, and Saltarea) have grown rapidly. The Greater Tokyo Metropolitan Area, defined as Tokyo Metropolis plus the urbanized portions of three adjacent prefectures, now totals more than 27 million inhabitants; it is the largest urban area in the world. Crowding is a serious problem, particularly in the 23 wards and close suburbs. In Tokyo Metropolis the population density is 5443 persons per sq km (14,097 per sq mi), while in the 23 wards the density is 13,000 persons per sq km (33,670 per sq mi). By contrast, the average density for Japan as whole, itself a crowded country in comparison to other countries, is 328 persons per sq km (850 per sq mi). Problems that relate to crowding include traffic congestion, high land prices and rents, air and noise pollution, lack of open space and greenery, and blocked access to direct sunlight in areas of high-rise construction.

Actually, over a long term, we don't know.  Over a short term, the EM waves obviously don't mess with our current mental processes.  But I have seen studies that showed people who use cell phones next to their heads are slightly more likely to get brain tumors, and men who carry cell phones in their pockets are more likely to get testicular cancer, but I've also seen studies that show there are no long term effects.  Since the widespread use of this technology is relatively new, no one can say definitively "yes" or "no" on whether they are harmful long-term.
I am going to school for my MBA right now and that is actually a topic of discussion we had last semester in one of my classes.  That is a trend that I believe will continue.

I personnaly, would not pay for it, but I am not much of a chat room type of person.

If you think about it, since we do all of our work with existing materials and spaces, we are not able to create anything without destroying something else. If we build a house, we have destroyed an open space in the place we built our house. If we use wood to build a house, we have destroyed a tree to get the wood.  It is impossible for us to make anything without un-making (or drastically altering) some other thing as part of the same process.  But since we are capable of thinking about our choices, we should always pause when we have an idea to build something, while we decide whether the accompanying destruction will be worthwhile.\\nI don't mean for this to sound so lofty, idealistic and unreal.  It is a simple, often overlooked truth. Everything that a human can take as food is a thing that was once living, with very few exceptions, notably milk and honey. Destruction goes hand in hand with creation. Our mistake is in focusing on one, but not acknowledging the other.
I think because when you Google you only get weblinks, when you ask a question here you get other peoples opinions and points of view.

Hey!\\n\\n1. Here is how a pyramidal company works. a. Someone asks you to work for them. Then, you buy their products. c. Then, you ask 3 or more people to work for you. They buy your products. d. Each of them asks more people to work for them, and they buy their products. This means that the people who work for you must buy more products from you. \\n\\nSoon, you will have many people under you, buying your products.\\n\\n2. You cannot add a word to your ID. You must create a new ID.\\n\\n3. You cannot send a "massage" by computer to a mobile. Why would anyone want to do that? Personally, I like my massages given in person by a cute woman. \\n\\nBut if you want to send a text message from your computer, that's another story! Find out what telephone company the person uses. Go to their telephone company's website. You can often send a free text message from it. \\n\\nOr if you have the same chat program as the other person, e.g. MSN, you can send text messages from there to their phone.\\n\\nI hope you understand!

Chivalry is a part of our traditional beliefs about the  gender roles. We have the predefined ideas regarding how members of each gender group shall function in the society. These concepts though vary in every community, many of them are common in different parts of the world. Our societies have traditionally been patriarchal. Power was always enjoyed by men, baring only a few examples. This age old impact on our mentality is so deep and universal that not only men think they are powerful but also do the women. So women always love men to be chival. It satisfies their urge for 'attention'. Moreover it is a part of the game called Impression Formation. Is it not the way boys try to impress the opposite sex? It is to show the women that one is potentially the better father of her children, who is caring and resourceful ( very imp.).All the more I think women are typically convenient on this issue. Why do they wish men to pay the dinner, open the car doors for them, buy them flowers, or escort them down the stairs? At the same time they demand the sexual parity, equal treatment to both the sexes, women empowerment.\\nAlthough it may sound like a bit accusing for both the parties, no one in fact is to be blamed. We all hold on to the ideas to which we are primed. But with the ever changing references from the 21st century, we certainly must think over our concepts regarding the gender roles, be it chivalry, baby sitting by fathers, and yes the equal pay for equal work.

I am not sure what your question is but here is some information on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA): \\n \\nData Envelopment Analysis (DEA). A nonparametric method in operations research and econometrics for multivariate frontier estimation and ranking.\\n\\nWith the intention of being consistent with microeconomic production theory and when being conscious of the existence of inefficiencies in the production processes, frontier techniques have been developed during the last 30 years.\\n\\nAmong the different solutions, we can find a nonparametric method called Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which is a linear programming methodology to measure the efficiency of multiple Decision Maker Units (DMUs) when the production process presents a structure of multiple inputs and outputs.\\n\\nThen, some of the benefits of it are: (1) there is no need to explicitly specify a mathematical form for the production function, (2) it has proven to be useful in uncovering relationships that remain hidden for other methodologies, (3) is capable of handling multiple inputs and outputs, (4) it can be used with any input-output measurement, (5) the sources of inefficiency can be analysed and quantified for every evaluated unit.

In full, JOSÉ PROTACIO RIZAL MERCADO Y ALONSO REALONDA (born 19 June 1861, Calamba, Philippines- died 30 December 1896, Manila, Philippines), patriot, physician and man of letters whose life and literary works were an inspiration to the Philippine nationalist movement.\\nRizal was the son of a prosperous landowner and sugar planter of Chinese-Filipino descent on the island of Luzon. His mother, Teodora Alonso, one of the most highly educated women in the Philippines at that time, exerted a powerful influence on his intellectual development.\\n\\nHe was educated at the Ateneo de Manila and the University of Santo Tomas in Manila. In 1882, he went to study medicine and liberal arts at the University of Madrid. A brilliant student, he soon became the leader of the small community of Filipino students in Spain and committed himself to the reform of Spanish rule in his home country, though he never advocated Philippine independence. The chief enemy of reform, in his eyes, was not Spain, which was going through a profound revolution, but the Franciscan, Augustinian and Dominican friars who held the country in political and economic paralysis.\\n\\nRizal continued his medical studies in Paris and Heidelberg. In 1886, he published his first novel in Spanish, Noli Me Tangere, a passionate exposure of the evils of the friars rule, comparable in its effect to Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. A sequel, El Filibusterismo, 1891, established his reputation as the leading spokesman of the Philippine reform movement. He annotated an edition in 1890 on Antonio Morga's Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, which showed that the native people of the Philippines had a long history before the coming of the Spaniards.\\n\\nHe became the leader of the Propaganda Movement, contributing numerous articles to its newspaper, La Solidaridad, published in Barcelona. Rizal's political program, as expressed in the newspaper, included integration of the Philippines as a province of Spain, representation in the Cortes (the Spanish parliament), the replacement of the Spanish friars by the Filipino priests, freedom of assembly and expression, and equality of Filipinos and Spaniards before the law.\\n\\nAgainst the advice of his parents and friends, Rizal returned to the Philippines in 1892. He found a nonviolent reform society, La Liga Filipina, in Manila, and was deported to Dapitan, in northwest Mindanao, an island south of the Philippines. He remained in exile for four years, doing scientific research and founding a school and hospital. In 1896, the Katipunan, a nationalist secret society, launched a revolt against Spain. Although he had no connections with that organization or any part in the insurrection, Rizal was arrested and tried for sedition by the military. Found guilty, he wa publicly executed by a firing squad in Manila. His martyrdom convinced Filipinos that there was no alternative to independence from Spain. On the eve of his execution, while confined in Fort Santiago, Rizal wrote Mi Ultimo Adios ("My Last Farewell"), a masterpiece of 19th-century Spanish verse.

yes they should ban many of them.\\nthe argument really simply is that children are to young to understand the potential harm and brainwashing of advertising. most kids TV stations have adverts that actively encourage the child to nag their parents for the product and encourage the child to behave badly if they don't get what they want. it is done very subtly so many parents who aren't actively watching the programme, which is the most common (kids in one room with TV, parents in nearby room or doing something else in the same room)don't notice the adverts message.\\nIf an adult does not like an advert or isn't interested in the product they ignore it. it is not as simple for a child.\\n\\nMany of the large food and drink companies in US have realised that if you can, through adverts alone, get a child to associate fun and happiness with for example McDonald's then that child, into complete adulthood, when tested, will subconsciously want to eat McDonald's if they feel sad.
Ohhh...I'm doing good. I'm located in a small town called Terra Alta, WV in the Appalachian mountains. Population under 1,500. As for were I live the poker runs and rallies were pretty much over with a month ago due to the cold up here. There will be a polar run in January over in Maryland...but that can be cold especially if temperatures reach the teens or low 20's. Many of the runs they have here goes towards families that have a high medical expense else their property burnt down. They had 2 runs maybe 3 for a little girl in town who was 12 yrs old for a medical condition, however she passed on about 2 months ago. They have had runs for Muscular Dystrophy and the Christian motorcycle ass will have Run for the Son to raise money for missionaries. Over all most runs go to the people around here with outstanding medical expense (if at all possible to help children).

In chemistry, a salt is any ionic compound composed of positively charged cations and negatively charged anions, so that the product is neutral and without a net charge. These ions can be inorganic (Cl−) as well as organic (CH3−COO−) and monoatomic (F−) as well as polyatomic ions (SO42−).\\n\\nA metallic salt has a metal as the cation.\\n\\nNote that "ionic compound" means the bond is not covalent.

Herpes zoster, commonly known as shingles, is caused by the same virus responsible for chicken pox.  After the initial exposure, herpes zoster lies dormant in certain nerve fibers.   It may become active as a result of many factors such as:  aging, stress, suppression of the immune system, and certain medication.  Because of the layout of the nerves that herpes zoster resides in, it only affects one side of the body or face during an outbreak.  It begins as a rash that lead to blisters and sores on the skin.  When the nerve branch that supplies the eye is involved, the forehead, nose, and eyelids may also be affected.  Sores on the nose are a key signal of possible eye involvement.   \\nHerpes zoster can cause several problems with the eye and surrounding skin that may have long term effects.  Inflammation and scarring of the cornea, along with conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva) and iritis (inflammation of the iris) are typical problems that require treatment.  \\nMany who experience this infection find it extremely painful.

i am a big woman and have never had a problem with men. as a matter of fact it has been my experience whether or not they admit it most men like a bigger woman. just because society today makes it out like if your not skinny or the perfect size then no one will find you attractive. well thats just not true. beauty comes from within. you could be the prettiest woman in the world. but if you no personality or think you are gods gift to the world you wont be very attractive. And as for whether or not someone would be friends with a woman who was large in size. What FRIEND would judge your worth based on your looks. That person would have to be pretty shallow and therefore not worth having as a friend.

You shouldn't feel guilty about fantasizing about other people. I do it all the time, and so does my boyfriend. I think it is okay to fantasize about others because it's only a fantasy and not something you would pursue in real life. It's normal.

Definitely a computer, that would be number one!! A lot of organizational skills, or at least try and learn some if that is something to work on. A nice comfortable desk and chair, make sure your set up has things that are accessible to your needs. Otherwise it'll be a hassle, and that's not fun. Basically anything else depends on what kind of home office you're looking for. As in, what you'll be using it for. Like basic billing and that sort of "home esk" thing. Or if work will be done in it for a specific business. It's really all up to you. Get the basics you need and then as  you go along it'll grow as you need more things. Just make sure and keep your desk clean, makes it much easier to find your specific paperwork. Ohhh and always file!!

Alcohol has been the scourge of human society since time immemorial. It continues to cost countless human lives, and causes terrible misery to millions throughout the world. Alcohol is the root cause of several problems facing society. The statistics of soaring crime rates, increasing instances of mental illnesses and millions of broken homes throughout the world bear mute testimony to the destructive power of alcohol.\\n\\n\\n1.   Prohibition of alcohol in the Qur’an\\n\\nThe Glorious Qur’an prohibits the consumption of alcohol in the following verse:\\n\\n"O ye who believe! Intoxicants and Gambling,\\n(Dedication of) stones, And (divination by) arrows,Are an Abomination – Of Satan’s handiwork; Eschew such (abomination),T hat ye may prosper."[Al-Qur’an 5:90]\\n                                 \\n\\n\\n2.   Prohibition of alcohol in the Bible\\n\\nThe Bible prohibits the consumption of alcohol in the following verses:\\n\\n   1.

According to Wikipedia;\\n\\nIceboxes date back to the days of ice harvesting which in a growing America had hit an industrial high that ran from the mid 19th century to the 1930's when the refrigerator was introduced into the home. Most municipally consumed ice was harvested and stored in ice plants which did not actually create artificial ice, but stored natural ice brought in from snow packed area or frozen lakes. Even Thoreau's Walden Pond was not spared from ice harvesting where some 1,000 tons of ice were harvested daily.\\n\\nI already knew they harvested the ice from frozen lakes. I didn't realize they stored it in "ice plants". So I learned something new!

Introducing the alphabet as a game with letter books or flash cards, scholastic's Hands on Learning textured cards are great. Make number and letter activities part of everyday fun and activities. Try not to push the 'learning' experience as under 2 is a bit young to expect to sit still and rigidly pay attention. I find that stopping a game while it is still fun will lead to wanting to play more in the future. The first site I listed has many activities with the 'why's' behind them and the second site is an english as foreign language site (I teach english in korea) there are many very simple introductory coloring pages and simple activites like reciepes and games. Good Luck and most of all remember to have fun!

No.  I think you are more likely not pregnant than pregnant.  Many things can affect your period, such as stress, dieting, or a lot of exercise.  It may just be late.  Of course, you could still be pregnant, so do another pregnancy test in a week or so.  A doctor may help calm your nerves , make sure everything is all right, and help you get birth control if you would like it.  Take care.

I am assuming that you are using Windows XP (with out without the service packs)\\nThe best way is to use the Windows "File and Settings transfer wizard.  Find this under Start->All Programs->Accessories->System tools->Files and Settings Transfer Wizard.  This will help you to transfer your files and most of the windows settings.  However you will have to reinstall most of the programs seperately in the new computer.\\n\\nFollow these steps\\n1. Run the wizard in your old computer.  If you can get a parallel cable to connect your old computer to the new one then choose that option.  Otherwise save the settings in a folder in your hard disk\\n\\n2. Open your old computer case and remove your hard disk.  Now open the case of your old computer and connect the hard disk to the new one.\\n\\n3.  Start the new computer and run the tool again.

the road is the path you are on in life, the wooded areas are the snares and brambles, troubles and temptations that are around you..you ran out of gas which means spiritually you were to a point that you were drained, and couldn't go forward in the "vehicle" that you had made it that far in...that vehicle could be a specific church, or a doctrine from a church, maybe even another religion...the hill is the battle to find the truth of GOD...the perception of time that it takes to get to the service station symbolizes the amount of time totally that you have spent seeking and pushing forward...there may have been times that you sought, then stopped seeking, then started again...the black panther stalking you was the enemy-he thought by isolating you that you were unprotected..the fact that the Alpha wolf howled was a call to the warrior angelic host to intervene and keep you from the claws of the enemy...JESUS walks with us, protects us and leads us back to the power source, FATHER GOD.

That is a relative question.  You could say the US, but then the problem is the widening gap between rich and middle class.  You could say Germany, but the high cost of labor is causing industry to move to Eastern Europe.  You could say Britian, but the govenment funds pubilc enterpirse that directly competes with private enterprise.  You could say China, but there is likely large scale corruption.  You could say Cuba, but the lack of private property means that government could intervene when they feel threatening.  You could also go with Japan, but there is fear in thinking "outside the box."\\n\\nPersonally, I would go with Germany, despite the high labor costs.  Though I don't know much about the Scandinavian countries or Australia.
The whole thing started because Cruz would flip the Germans off (he would kiss his outstretched middle finger) after every single Argentinian penalty kick that went in. Borroski (GER) did the same after his penalty kick and it pissed the players off even more when they lost. The unused substitute Leandro Cufre (ARG) got his tall blond German players mixed-up and ended up kicking Per Mertesacker (GER) in the crotch after his team lost, thereby starting the brawl on the field. Oliver Beerhoff was trying to shield his players after Mertesacker went down and ended up getting some of the Argentinian frustration focused on him. \\n\\nhttp://www.bild.t-online.de/BTO/sport/wm2006/aktuell/07/01/pruegel-gauchos/pruegel-gauchos.html

I think what it is referring to is the lack of accountability by all referee's in alot of different sports.  True soccer referee's (which I happen to be on for 7 years) are out there on an island and we have the benefit of watching replays, but all officials should have some sort of grading system or be called out when they make a mistake.  If I make a mistake at my job, I get called on it.  What makes officials, especially soccer referee's immune to it?

Like a few people above have said, it depends on what your native language is and how your brain is wired.

They thought it was save thousands of US soldiers and Japanese people if we had to carpet bomb japan and invade it. I don't know why they dropped two though. Truman rationalized it's dropping by saying they were dropped on "purely military targets" which is not the truth, nor is that it would save innocent Japanese lives.\\n\\nI am not sure it saved that many innocent people as almost half a million people died in the attacks and there were no significant military in either city where the bombs were dropped, contrary to what Truman thought.\\n\\nIn Nagasaki alone almost 1/4 million people were wiped from the face of the earth, so Truman's innocent people theory was bogus.\\n\\nIt did bring to end the war within a few days. The United Nations  was born within 4 months of the Bombing.\\n\\nAnd Atom bombs ARE nuclear. If they weren't why did thousands die of exposure to radiation? They certainly are NOT conventional weapons. The bombs were dropped within 3 days of each other and people couldn't watch 230.000 innocent men, women and children die from their living room television as they could watch the "war" Iraq from media moles planted with combat units.\\n\\nIt also began the nuclear age which is exactly what the government was warned about and petitionrd by the scientist that developed it. They wanted to use it for peaceful purposes, not to kill a half million people and begin an arms race.

"...was a Danish (Scanian) nobleman astronomer as well as an astrologer and alchemist\\n\\nHe is credited with the most accurate astronomical observations of his time, and the data was used by his assistant Kepler to derive the laws of planetary motion. No one before Tycho had attempted to make so many redundant observations, and the mathematical tools to take advantage of them had not yet been developed. He did what others before him were unable or unwilling to do — to catalogue the planets and stars with enough accuracy so as to determine whether the Ptolemaic or Copernican system was more valid in describing the heavens."
You should make an appointment to see your Dr. Ask him to send you for a pulmonary function test. They can find out if you have asthma. They may do a methacholine challenge test.

Depends on the state. In CA, if someone is found driving a car with a suspended or revoked license, they can impound the car for a madatory 30 day hold. (CA vehicle code 14602.6) It doesn't matter that it's your car. \\n\\nIf you knowingly let him drive your car with a revoked license, you can also be charged with a crime. \\n\\nYou are intitled to an impound hearing with the agency that impounded car. If you are the owner of the car, just call them and request the hearing. You can plead your case to them.
I do agree with the verdict and think it was inevitable, but that is not to say that it doesn't make me feel a little sick that I'm sitting in the safety of my home looking at a man on tv who has just been told that he will hang in the next 60 days. It should never have been allowed to get this far, our governments should have stopped him decades ago, but instead they decided to sell him weapons, the area of accountability is a lot larger than it looks at first glance

It looks like you put a lot of work into it. It's functional, but you need to improve on the aesthetic appeal it seems a bit "canned, or cookie cutter, or like one in a million others". It needs more personality at a glance and less dry text. If I had to grade it on a scale of 1-100 I would give you about a 47 because of the "spread sheet look". Overall, good work though. I say all this not to be negative, but just give you feed back.

In response to some of the enlighting liberal answers above;\\n1.  Liberals are cowards.  Did liberals support our military in Veitnam?  NO!  In Korea?  NO!  Did they support Regan during the cold war?  NO!  Did liberals want to get involved with the Gulf War?  NO!  Did Liberal Bill Clinton find out who attacked the WTC in 1993?  NO!  Did the Clinton adminisration cut and run from Mogadishu?  YES!!  Did the clinton adminisration do anything about the USS Cole being attacked and killing 17 troops?  NO!  Um libs - there seems to be a pattern developing and all of mainstream america can see it.\\n2.  Libs have you ever heard of John Kerry (you know he fought in nam), I believe that idiot threw his war metals over the fence of the white house and then lied to congress about war crimes our troops never committed for political gain.  If that's not mocking and disrespecting our troops, then I don't know what is. Didn't liberals keep a running count of troop deaths in the begining of the Iraq invasion?  I recall they couldn't wait to get to the magic number of 1500 dead troops.  I am sure they thought that would cause the adminisrtation to retreat.  How many innocent babies are murdered because people don't use protection?  Anybody keeping a running count?  How many americans die on the roadways everyday?  Anybody keeping a running count?  How about cancer and dieseases?  Any count on those deaths?\\n3.  Retreat, defeat, pandering, appeasing, and self blame are the tenets that liberals live by.  Liberals have set themselves up to look good when something terrible happens to america.  It's a sad thing to be a liberal these days.

While its possible some FEMA assitance was given to saints players (not likely, but I dont know the FEMA rules on that) the money your probably thinking of was given by the NFL as part of the "pay for play" adjustment in the CBA.  Normally, this adjustment goes to those players who played alot of downs  but were not paid "starter" money. The theory is, minimal contracts are given for backup players and if a player hired for just special teams/backup is moved to a starter position through injury or great performance he has earned to be paid along with other starters. \\n\\nThe Saints recieved their money for "performance in adverse conditions" notably havingno true locker room, practing under an underpass and playing a home game in NY.

i dont no yu tell me
Because all they see is the tv, nintendo or pc. Blame their parents.  Monkey see, monkey do.  If the parents are active and creative then the children will be too.  I see this in very young children.  My kid is 16 mos. and loves to watch (and chase) birds, pick flowers, throw balls, play on the swing set, and 'read'.  When she goes to the daycare for an hour while I work out she plays with the toys (what a novel idea!) while most of the other kids her age are zoned out to the boob tube.  The fact is that technology is an easier way to entertain a child while creative play sometimes takes some fresh ideas from Mom and Dad.
As a former assistant pastor, I have seen this type of dillemma, before. The problem is that most medium to large churches have become a source of entertainment, rather than inspiration. \\n\\nIt sounds like this church has a youth group of several dozen kids. They probably have a youth pastor for Wednesday night youth group, and a volunteer young adult to teach SS. This volunteer sounds like being seen as cool is more important to him than inspiring the kids to be moral.\\n\\nWhenever you frequent a place with large numbers of people you will find small groups of people that become the true source of inspiration, whether for good or evil. People cannot grow spiritually when they are simply members of an audience. We need companionship and friendship, a hand to hold, a shoulder to cry on. We will be naturally drawn to those we feel are most likely to accept us.\\n\\nThe problem is not one person, it is the entire empire of Christianity we have built in America. Jesus chose twelve disciples. These twelve were the ones he poured himself into. The common bond of this group was love. Yet, even among these twelve, one became a traitor. Can you imagine how many Judas could have influenced if he had his own SS class?\\n\\nThe problem is extremely complex, but the answer is simple. Find a few families that have children close to the ages of yours. Meet with them at your house, their house, the coffee house. Study with them, pray with them, talk with them. Don't try to start a class, just be friends. Have a BBQ together, go to the lake together, watch the game together. In other words; make friends, and let them be your support group. \\n\\nIf you want to attend a church on Sunday morning, fine. But, don't let that be the sole source of inspiration for your family. Jesus called his disciples "friends"; not students, congregants, or members. You need a small group of like-minded families sharing the love of God, and the  journey of life, together.

faster than 15 km for sure. i ride with a bike club that rides consistently around 20 miles an hour, and there are many women who ride. i'd definitely imagine a road race for women would be able to consistently hold above 6. whatever miles an hour 15 km/h equals. Me and several friends of mine (including girls) averaged much faster than that on mountain climbs in colorado.\\n\\nas for speeds they can achieve, if its in the mountains, going down it would easily be in excess of 50 miles an hour.
I don't believe that God condones any act of killing another and would not view any war as justified. God in infinite wisdom and compassion however, knows that the human race has a lot to learn and I'm sure will forgive the actions of soldiers in a  war.\\n\\nRather than being concerned about someone "going to Hell" (which I believe takes a lot of hard work to get there), my  biggest concern is for the returning soldiers living in the Hell in their own minds as they remember the horrors they lived through.  Pray that all find peace.

Hello.\\n\\nI am currently in medical school, so my answer is probably the best...  ;)\\n\\nHonestly, you can major in anything that you want to, as long as you meet the requirements for most medical schools.  This tend to be, but not limited to:\\n\\n* 1 year in general biology\\n* 1 year of general chemistry\\n* 1 year of organic chemistry\\n* 1 year of physics\\n\\nSome require this too in addition to what I just listed:\\n\\n* 1 semester of college level math (calc, trig, etc)\\n* 1 semester of Biochemistry\\n* 1 semester of Statistics\\n\\nHonestly, your minor doesnt really matter.  If you want to look "more well rounded" you could minor in a humanity.  Do WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO.  This makes you more of a real person - which is what the med schools look for.\\n\\nI majored in Human Nutrition and minored in Religious Studies.  I have a really good friend who got into med school with a creative writing major.

I'm bisexual myself, and have had serious relationships with both men and women.  I've explained to many people in the past the inherent difficulty that bisexuals may have in monogomy.  The closest metaphor I have come up with is this...If you had to live the rest of your life and only could have oral relations, and no penetrative relations, would you be able to make due with that?  Monogomy for a bisexual is like that...effectively cutting off half of their sexual interest.  It can be done, of course...but it's not their 'natural' way of being.\\n\\nI'm not saying this means that your friend is allowed to cheat on his girlfriend...honesty is the cornerstone of any relationship.  But you'd be surprised how many wives/girlfriends are aware of and accept a man who has the need to express their sexuality.  How he and his girlfriend make their choices is not really something that you need to expend a lot of energy trying to worry about.\\n\\nThe main concern I have is that you seem to imply that you and your friend are getting more serious than simply recreational activity.  If he is in a relationship and is still seeking another relationship on the side, this goes more to his character than his sexual orientation, and ending the whole thing is a very good idea.

The ultimate question for you to ask before taking the LSAT (I am not sure about the LNAT) is if you do well on a standard exam.  If you are good at it, you will very much likely succeed in getting high scores and in law school and the bar exam later on. My mentor who sat on the bar review commission told me there's a strikingly high correlation between the LSAT score, and the law school performance and the bar exam.  \\n\\nHaving said that, if you are not good at it, the best you can do is to learn how to approach the standard exams. And I want to remind you that being a poor standard exam taker is not insurmountable to overcome this.  However, you have to know how and follow exactly what I tell you here.  Here is how: The most important thing is when you practice by solving the problems, make sure you always time them.  The next important thing is once again, time them.  Next thing you have to worry about is .... you got the idea by now -- time them!!!!\\n\\nRemember also it is a game that most of us have the ability to do well.  But I have seen way too many people caught up with notion that you have to get all the questions right.  You should have no problem solving about a half of the problems correctly before you begin practicing them.

Jesuit scholar says Gospel of Judas does not merit name 'Gospel'\\n\\nBy Cindy Wooden\\nCatholic News Service\\n\\nROME (CNS) -- The Gospel of Judas was unimportant to most Christians when it was written hundreds of years ago and it is unimportant today, said a Jesuit professor who has convoked a series of ecumenical studies of the historical Jesus. \\n\\nJesuit Father Gerald O'Collins, a longtime professor of Christology at Rome's Pontifical Gregorian University, said the text, like the gospels of Mary Magdalene and Philip, "does not merit the name 'Gospel.'" \\n\\nThe National Geographic Society unveiled the document April 6, posting a copy of it on the society's Web site, www.nationalgeographic.com, and releasing English translations of portions of the text.\\n\\n"A 'Gospel' is a literary genre -- established by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John -- focusing on the life, death and resurrection of Jesus," Father O'Collins said. \\n\\nWhile including events supposedly related to the life of Jesus, the Gospel of Judas and the others really are texts "attempting to bolster the importance" of the personalities they are named after, not of Jesus, the priest said. \\n\\n"They are not summaries of the good news," he said.\\n\\nThe texts come from the gnostic tradition, a religious-philosophical current popular in the second, third and fourth centuries. The gnostics claimed to have secret knowledge unavailable to the vast majority of people and focused so strongly on the spiritual and intellectual that they despised material creation, including the human body. \\n\\nIn the year 180, St. Irenaeus condemned the gnostics, mentioning particularly a Gospel of Judas.\\n\\nFather O'Collins said the most important thing about the text released in early April is that "it shows just how right Irenaeus was in saying the gnostics were against mainstream Christianity and Judaism, they were against our God." \\n\\n"To give Judas greater credit," the Jesuit said, the gnostics "portray Jesus giving him secret knowledge. It was a nice try," but there is no evidence to support the claim.\\n\\n"It was junk then and it is junk now," he said .\\n\\nFather O'Collins, who between 1996 and 2003 convoked a series of ecumenical, interdisciplinary summits for scholars on the historical Jesus, said it was "ridiculous" for anyone to claim publication of the Gospel of Judas will challenge mainstream Christianity. \\n\\nEND

I quit smoking ages ago. I moved onto cigars then eventually stopped. Exercise is very good for taking your mind off smoking. Avoid going into bars where there are smokers. The health benefits are a bonus and of course, your clothes won't smell discusting either. Failing that, try handcuffs!
well  a tube in her lungs can mean several things. but it sounds she has had a rather difficult time.if she has problems with her lungs and there are unknown spots there abcesses it can be from many things,or a simple infection that settled in her lungs and her body isolated it and encapsulated the bug.\\nor it can be from a systemic wide organism\\nand it has simply gotten in enough places\\nher body can no longer control its spread.\\n  until they know what it is be content she is doing ok.\\nthey could be talking about doing a biopsy to see what it is,or chest tubes which you havent said if her lung has collasped.\\nthey could be talking on mechanical ventilation also,which is placing a tuber in her lungs to right at the carina so air can go into both lungs s she can breath easier.\\n or placing drainage tube into the abcess to drain it.\\n  so the bottom line is none is terrifcally major,except the illness its self.\\n  whether she has a bacterial infection in the lung or other reason, the major thing it sounds they are trying to control it and may have to let her rest on a ventilator till they can control the infection. saw on that they will give her medications and put her to sleep,and place a tube into her lungs and hook her up to a vent. they may keep her knocked out till they can treat the infection,and then get her back to breathing on her own.\\n  the next thing is is what kind of infection is it. there are bugs out there \\nthat are not good to get, so without sounding crude simply relax until they know what they are dealing with.\\n  some of the bugs can totally destroy parts of the lung,others simply get isolated and encapsalated by the body.\\n  so the trick is is to get a direct specimen of the critter,and then grow it in the lab and test what kills it,in order to know how to treat her.\\n oxygen isnt all that bad either,it is simply what the bug is and get samples in order to know how to treat it.\\n  if you wonder i do intensive care work,and tried to make things simple for easy understanding.\\nshe has an infection and she has become very sick and they dont know what to treat her with yet.\\n  so relax some, and support her.\\ndepending on what they find out will determine the rest.

The 'electrical' activity of the brain is largely chemical, and is mostly unaffected by magnetic fields.  However, magnetic fields can be used as part of a system to measure what's happening in your brain.  These various scans are a medical diagnostic tool and also a research tool.  Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging can distinguish among differing tissue types.\\n\\nAnd no, magnetism and electrically are not the same.  They are interdependent, but are both independent of gravity.

Yes, completely normal! Obviously we're not talking corkscrews here but a little curvature is perfectly normal. And I shouldn't think women would bother about it - I certainly wouldn't - I think personality and humour are more important. Anyway, presumably someone that's seeing it already likes you quite a lot anyway. lol. Seriously, don't worry - my boyfriend's goes slightly to one side (although I won't tell him I wrote that down). There have been some interesting studies done in which researchers morphed faces to be more or less symmetrical. The findings were that we like things more or less symmetrical - but not completely - subjects described feeling uneasy when looking at faces that were completely symmetrical. A little asymmetry apparently puts the mind at rest. Maybe it makes us more trustworthy and more approachable?

Try sending him a package that will remind him of home.  He will need the reminder especially being away from home during the holidays.  Throw in some items that represent his favorite sports team (hat, jersey, cards, etc).  Put together a stocking (with all of his favorite treats)...this gives him something special to do on Christmas day.  Include some DVD's for him and his buddies to watch as they are sure to get some down time for the holidays.  And include some PICTURES just to make him smile.  Try to get some from his family too and make a small album for him to enjoy.  Have fun with it!\\n\\nYou will need to package everything securly, make sure nothing is persishable or illegal (alcohol, cigs, porn) and take it to the Post Office.  You should try to have the package sent by the beginning of December so it will make it to him by Christmas.  Military Mail runs slower around the Holidays especially since it has so far to go.

In science, parsimony is preference for the least complex explanation for an observation. This is generally regarded as good when judging hypotheses. Occam's Razor also states the "principle of parsimony".\\n\\nWe do that everyday in judging causes of events. We start with the most simple likely cause of an event and only move to more complex explanations when we can rule out the more simple explanation.

You could convert the whole thing to improper fractions, so 3 1/4 would be 13/4 and 1 3/4 would be 7/4. 13/4-7/4=6/4.  6/4 can be reduced to 3/2 which, converted to a mixed number, is 1 1/2.

In fact, politically and socially it is far more radical than any government that has ever existed.\\n\\nIf you believe that God does exist this adds another dimension; God doesn't "go out of fashion" and he doesn't "need to get with the times", as He created time itself. Therefore, it is still very relevant on that level.

Yes it can. If you are intoxicated in a public place or under the influence of alcohol or narcotics you can be arrested for DUI, DWI, or Public intoxication. If you are a danger to yourself or others or are considered a mental risk you can be taken into custody also for your protection. If a friend is at your home and sees Narcotics in plain view and they are a credible witness a search warrant can be obtained and your house searched and you subsequently can be arrested for what they find if it is in the warrant or not. An example would be your friend saw you smoking marijuana and you have a bag of it on your table. If your friend has given credible information before to the Police then they are proven up to be credible and a warrant is very easy to get. If a police officer is responding to a call at an apartment complex and your window is open and he/she smells you smoking a joint and looks in the window and sees you he no longer needs a warrant because in his/her training they have been trained to recognize the smell of burning marijuana and that is probable cause enough to snatch you up and hold you until a warrant can be obtained and if they can see the dope in plain view they don't even need the warrant.
Of course freedom of speech is protected.  As with all freedoms it is not cake once baked but a flowing stream where the banks must always be worked with to keep the flowing free. \\n\\nTo restate the obvious:\\n\\nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.  - First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\\n\\nThis words as stated are clear and concise, but they are not cast in concrete with no maintenance need.  Rather, they are a fertile bed which needs constant care of weeding and fertilizing.  The court is one type of weeding . . . . \\n\\n“The main purpose of constitutional provisions like the First Amendment was said to be, to prevent all such previous restraints upon publications as had been practiced by other governments, and they do not prevent the subsequent punishment of such as may be deemed contrary to the public welfare.”\\n\\nre: Patterson v. Colorado [1907].\\n\\nJustice Holmes expanded when he opined in Schenck v. United States [1919] “It well may be that the prohibition of laws abridging the freedom of speech is not confined to previous restraints . . . . But the character of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it is done.  (Then he uttered that most famous phrase)  The most Stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic.”\\n\\nThe point is the that the courts have altered  and refined our view of this amendment (not the freedom).\\n\\nSo too is lobbying (a form of petitioning) a tool you can use to ensure that your perspective of this amendment (vis-à-vis the individual right of freedom of speech) is given worthy attention.\\n\\nFreedom of speech is real and protected, but the question is, will you (any you) work to ensure it stays protected?.

A long time ago, before people knew what the heart was really used for, it came to be associated with strong emotion.  Whenever you feel strong emotion, there's a sensation on the left side of the chest.  We now know that sensation is actually caused by chemicals in the brain.  Back then, people didn't know that.  They just assumed that the heart controlled emotion.  Even know we know better now, the old associations still stick with us, as they have become so ingrained in our culture.

The sky in latitudes closer to the equator does appear to be a darker shade of blue, and here's why:\\n\\nThe blue color of the sky is caused by the scattering of wavelengths as the light from the sun penetrates the atmosphere. When the sun is overhead, short wavelengths (like blue and violet) get scattered the most, because the light has to penetrate less atmosphere to reach us. When the sun is low in the sky, as in during sunset, the light from the sun has to penetrate much more atmosphere than when it is overhead, because it comes in at an angle. As a result, the longer wavelength light (like red) penetrates more easily than the short-wavelength blue, which got scattered way back when the light first hits the atmosphere. This is why sunsets appear to be red. \\n\\nWith this in mind, consider that at latitudes near the equator are more likely, on average, to have the sun in a position more directly overhead than say, where I live, at about 45 degrees north latitude. Hence, where I live, the short-wavelength light gets filtered out just a little bit more than where you live, creating a lighter-colored sky. I also live at high altitude (about 6500 ft.), which increases the effect. A little long, but hope this helps.

It depends upon the other outstanding bids.\\n\\nIf it is on the NASDAQ and the bid is 49 and the ask is 49.50 and you offer to buy at 49.25 and you are the only bidder, then you should become the new bid price raising the bid/ask to 49.25 and 49.50.  If there are other bids that may not happen.\\n\\nIf it is on the exchanges, then you are bidding outside the range.  You will limit the prices when the current best offer is taken, presuming no one else will make an intervening bid.\\n\\nMarket makers cannot bid against the street, BUT if there are other outstanding orders, they are not bidding against the street.  So they may keep the old if there are outstanding valid prices because your purchase offer is not in the money as the high bid.

First, the oil companies are making around 10% margins on gas.  See Exxon's income statement here: http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=XOM&annual\\n\\nSo, if the government decided to chop off some of that last 10%, you might get back some of that.  Most people aren't going to be happy with just a few cents, though.\\n\\nFrom basic economics, if you impose a price ceiling, supply drops: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_ceiling\\n\\nFirms try to maximize their profits, so they'll be willing to produce less at a lower price.  If you lower it so that each gallon of gas is giving them negative profit (P < AVC), they'll just stop producing gas completely because it's dumb to keep on losing more and more money unless you're MSFT selling Xboxes trying to get market share.\\n\\nThey could also just sell it elsewhere and start exporting, where they can get a better price for it.  China and India are starting to demand more oil as their economies grow.  Or even sell the crude oil (without refining it) on the futures market and drive that down a little.\\n\\nEither way, the most likely scenario of a drastic price ceiling is long gas lines, similar to what happened in the 70s.  It's arguable whether this is more or less desirable than higher gas prices.

It is a transparent solution that is clear to amber in colour, and usually is light yellow. Urine is made up of a watery solution of metabolic wastes (such as urea), dissolved salts and organic materials. Fluid and materials being filtered by the kidneys, destined to become urine, come from the blood or interstitial fluid. The composition of urine is adjusted in the process of reabsorption when essential molecules needed by the body, such as glucose, are reabsorbed back into the blood stream via carrier molecules. The remaining fluid contains high concentrations of urea and other excess or potentially toxic substances that will be released from the body via urination. Urine flows through these structures: the kidney, ureter, bladder, and finally the urethra. Urine is produced by a process of filtration, reabsorption, and tubular secretion.\\n\\nUrine contains large amounts of urea, an excellent source of nitrogen for plants. As such it is a useful accelerator for compost. Urea is 10,000 times less toxic than ammonia and is a byproduct of deamination (2 NH3 molecules) and cellular respiration's (1 CO2 molecule) products combining together. Other components include various inorganic salts such as sodium chloride (the discharge of sodium through urine is known as "natriuresis".)\\n\\nFaeces:\\n\\nApproximately 75% of an ordinary sample of human feces is water. This percentage changes; diarrhea has more water than average and the longer the piece is in the bowels, the more water is taken out. Of the remaining 25%, 1/3 (or about 1/12 of the whole) is dead bacteria. Another 1/3 of the remaining quarter is undigestable food, such as cellulose.Common undigested foods found in human feces are seeds, nuts, corn, and beans, mainly because of their high fiber content.

Yes. \\n\\nIf you know you have pending taxes, the best way is to contact the IRS and make the arrangements to file. You must file first.  It is required.  That way you will know better where you stand and you are beginning to be in compliance. Then you can talk about how to pay the amounts indicated by your returns.\\n\\nThe payback scheme is based upon the income you need to live.  This may mean such things as changing the kids to public school, one telephone in the house, eating in, etc.  In the old days this was called "tightening your belt".  By the way, the IRS has charts that give working numbers for living expenses according to family size and other criteria. You must document your necessary expenses.  \\n\\nIf you let the default go, interest will accrue and worst things begin to happen, such as a lien being filed against you(which then becomes a public record), your employer could be contacted and your paycheck could be affected.\\n\\nDon't give excuses unless they are legal.  “I was irresponsible and I want to rectify my mistake”, is probably more palatable. Work with the tax man and he will work with you.\\n\\nNo, I don't work for the IRS.
In physics and chemistry, a plasma is typically an ionized gas, and is usually considered to be a distinct phase of matter in contrast to solids, liquids, and gases because of its unique properties. "Ionized" means that at least one electron has been dissociated from a proportion of the atoms or molecules. The free electric charges make the plasma electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields.\\n\\nThis fourth state of matter was first identified in a discharge tube (or Crookes tube), and so described by Sir William Crookes in 1879 (he called it "radiant matter")]. The nature of the Crookes tube "cathode ray" matter was subsequently identified by British physicist Sir J.J. Thomson in 1897], and dubbed "plasma" by Irving Langmuir in 1928 ], perhaps because it reminded him of a blood plasma]. Langmuir wrote:\\n\\n"Except near the electrodes, where there are sheaths containing very few electrons, the ionized gas contains ions and electrons in about equal numbers so that the resultant space charge is very small. We shall use the name plasma to describe this region containing balanced charges of ions and electrons."\\nPlasma typically takes the form of neutral gas-like clouds or charged ion beams, but may also include dust and grains (called dusty plasmas). [5] They are typically formed by heating and ionizing a gas, stripping electrons away from atoms, thereby enabling the positive and negative charges to move freely.

well, you might have to reinstall xp using the cd, but you can move all your documents from the old laptop in several ways. one way is to slave your HDD to the new laptop, which i believe you wouldn't have the right equipment at the moment. the other way is to burn your files from the old laptop on a cd, and copy them on the new laptop. the other way would be to zip all the files you want on the old laptop and email them to yourself, and download them on your new laptop. another way would be to use infrared or bluetooth if your laptops have them.\\nshould i proceed or is this enough?

As someone has already said, empires rise and fall. One of the first signs of weakness is when a country thinks it is so powerful that it can do what it wants. I think the US has stood for lots of good things in the past and has helped a lot of countries but Guantanamo, for example, lessens its moral authority. The war in Iraq seemed to be a knee jerk reaction. They had to nail some bad guy (with the right ethnic and/or religious background) whether he had anything to do with 9/11 or not. You expect things like this from a totalitarian government, not from the US. They would have been a lot better off concentrating on Afghanistan where they could have made a real difference.  \\n\\nHowever, if the US works more closely with other countries which, by the way, have had democracy for as long or longer, they will do a lot better than following the adage "my way or highway". As a great admirer of Roosevelt and Lincoln I can only shake my head in dismay when I think of the commander in chief you have now. The sooner he goes, the quicker the US will make ammends. By the way, I am no admirer of the Democrats. I just like people in charge who know what they are doing.

No, you can't, both of the previous answers were completely incorrect, and if you listen to them you will get in trouble with the IRS.\\n\\nTo invest in a Roth IRA, like any IRA, you need to have earned income in at least the amount you want to invest.  Thus if you want to put $1000, you have to have earned at least $1000.  If you want to max it out, you have to have earned at least $4000.\\n\\nThe lone exception here is the spousal IRA rule.  You don't have to show any earned income if your spouse made at least as much to cover both of you.  So if you both want to max it out, and you show no income, your spouse would have to have shown at least $8000.\\n\\nAs far as the upper income limits, if you're a single filer, you can do the full $4000 if you make $90,000 or less (Adjusted Gross Icnome).  From $90,000 to $110,000 is a phase-out range.  If you make over $110,000, you can no longer do the Roth.  Hopefully your company will allow you a Roth 401(k) in this case.\\n\\nIf you're married and filing jointly, your combined AGI must be $150,000 or less.  From $150,000 to $160,000 is the phase-out range, and over $160,000 is likewise excluded.\\n\\nHope this helps!\\n--J.

Becuase the Koran is a Muslim's Holy Book. Personally I think they should just get rid of this "swearing in on a Holy Book" entirely.

I agree as well.  You should list all of them.  Employers want to understand your progression.  If those job are irrelevant to what you are applying for then just put the dates, job title or function, and city, state.  That should be enough to erase any initial doubts about what you did in life before that.  But be prepared to answer any questions about those roles and if they have any bearing on your abilities as an employee or how they shaped you as a person.

Red cells have very little DNA so this is not a problem. Only white cells have DNA but most transfusions are now of leucodepleted red cells so an incredibly small amount of DNA is transfused, any that is will be removed through the normal processes of cell destruction and sequestration and will not replicate or "change" the DNA of the individual. The only thing that can change is the ABO/RhD blood group when a stem cell transfusion has taken place
Most racquet manufacturers that make junior models match racquet length to age. The attached link recommends a full-size between age 10-12 or when the junior player reaches a weight of 85 pounds. I played competitive junior tennis and switched to a full-length racquet when I was 11, but that was when juniors still played with low-tech racquets. \\n\\nIn general, you can go with a full-size racquet as long as the length doesn't interfere with stroke mechanics and the player can handle the weight. Sticking with a junior racquet for too long could encourage the player to hit with too much arm and wrist, and not enough hip and shoulder. \\n\\nBest recommendation is to go to a local pro-shop, get some current tips, and demo a bunch of racquets with varying lengths. Pick the one closest to the full-size that still feels comfortable.

This is a tricky one.  The canonical number is around 200 billion, but the actual number might be twice as great.\\n\\nThe challenge lies in counting stars…  All the stars we see in our night sky are at most about 1,000 light years away, and the lion’s share are much closer.  But the entire Milky Way Galaxy has a diameter 100 times that size!  Even with our most powerful telescopes, we’re only seeing a tiny percentage of the stars in our galaxy.  Plus, our local region of the galaxy might be very different from the galaxy as a whole—we know that the density of stars is much greater at the center of the galaxy, but there may be other differences as well.\\n\\nFor example, based on the number of stars within approximately 16 light years of the Sun, astronomers estimate the total number of stars within about 80 light years to be at least 7,500, but we’ve only cataloged about a third that number.  Does that mean astronomers’ work is just beginning, or do we live in an unusually dense stellar neighborhood?  Almost certainly the former, possibly both.  One thing is for certain:  we have only begun to discover certain types of very low mass, dim stars that could up the total number of stars in our galaxy considerably (that’s where the 400 million number comes from).\\n\\nThus, extrapolating the total number of stars from the number that we observe proves tricky.  A safe answer to your question is “hundreds of billions,” but if you need to be more precise, you could do worse than to say something like 200 million.\\n\\n\\nRyan Wyatt\\nRose Center for Earth & Space\\nNew York, New York

The following healthy living recommendations will help you if your trying to lose weight, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:\\n\\n*1) Burn more calories then your consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity. Get a fitness calculator that you can put on your cell phone and computer. This will allow you to easily  calculate this formula, log your daily calorie consumption, and log your physical activities.\\n\\n*2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement. \\n\\nAvoid “High Glycemic Load Carbs” (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as white potatoes) and drink lots of water. \\n\\nDo not try fad diets. Here is an excellent food pyramid that anyone can follow: http://www.rayandterry.com/html/images/PyramidLRG.gif?osCsid=26a424be471d1337e7c2f105d5c64d9d\\n\\n*3) Exercise on most days by doing cardiovascular training and/or resistance training activities. \\n\\nRead a book or find a certified trainer to make sure your doing all resistance training exercises correctly. A great book to buy that teaches you the resistance training basics is “Weight Training For Dummies”. A superb magazine to buy with excellent resistance training routines that will not get you bored is "Muscle and Fitness". Signup for the free newsletter.\\n\\nA good book to buy that teaches you the cardiovascular training basics is “Fitness For Dummies”. \\n\\n*4) Get plenty of sleep. Sleep experts say most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night for optimum performance, health, and safety. \\n\\n*5) Educate yourself continually on health issues. A good free publication is  “Dietary Guidelines For Americans 2005”. A superb book to read is “You The Owner’s Manual”. An excellent periodic publication is the “Nutrition Action Health Letter”.\\n\\n*6) Make a life long commitment to good health. A great test you can take to measure your biological age is at http://realage.com Look at other areas where you can improve your health. For example, make improvements on the quality of the air you breath. Review outdoor air quality forecasts where you live and get an indoor air purifier. Email me if you want a good air purifier recommendation and if you have other questions.\\n\\n *Click on all the source links below to get the full benefit of the recommendations.

Because they have forgotten the fact that according to their religion, God is the only one who needs to worry about other people believing.\\n\\nI am also an atheist. I have no problem with people practicing religion, or even talking about religion- but when people tell me that I'm wrong, I get pretty angry. Even if I am wrong, and God does exist, I'm going to hell and you're not going to have to deal with me when you're all the way up in heaven.\\n\\nSome atheists are guilty of that too, though, and it pisses me off just as badly.

If you are asking for a straight out answer, then you want the grades. Popularity won't get you into a college, but there are other forces in this decision.

That basically means you must acheive the perfects balance of popularity and brains. That balance however, is up to you to decide.

After marriage you will need to file for Adjustment of Status (Form I-485) to receive your Permanent Resident status.\\n\\nAnd yes to some extent you will be put under a microscope.  Once your AOS application is processed, they will schedule an interview for you and your spouse.  You will be required to submit evidence of a continued and genuine marriage such as financial documents in both names, utility bills in both names, shared credit cards, pictures, letters, etc.  The USC will have to submit an Affidivat of Support (Form I-864) to show that the foreign spouse will be financially supported and not become a public charge.\\n\\nIt's really not as daunting as it sounds.  If the marriage is genuine, its not difficult at all to prove it.

Men have superegos, they are bruised easily by females. Men feel that they should be able to do what they want, but that you shouldn't say anything about their behavior. It's not right for them to play with your emotions, but since they don't open up and express their emotions like women do, they feel that you should let them be, stop pressuring them. They are wrong, a couple needs to be able to talk, communicate or there is definitely a problem. As for lying, lying is a way they can feel in control, have everything go their way. They know the risks of lying to you, but they still do it because it's a defense mechanism, it keeps them from having to face their fears. Don't let them do you like that though, regardless if they are scared of commitment or being open with their mate, you can't sit back and be second. If they really love you, I think they will let the wall down and be open with you, like you are with them. But if they can't be the slightest bit open with you, then they really are not ready to have experience anything special with you. Just my take on it.

Yes - a work colleague threw a maltesa at me and it hit me on the top of the nose causing a massive nose bleed.

Point Guard-Okay this player is the most important to the team. Not necessarily the best but he is the most important.\\nfirst this person should have good ball handling skills and must be able to see the court better than anyone on the team. Vision is very important.He also needs to be a good passer because he is going to be the man guy who distributes the ball.\\n\\nShooting Guard-Now a lot of times this is the best player on the team.(if you look to the history of the NBA and presnt, like Jordan,Kobe, Wade, Lebron). This person should have a good shot and should be able to drive to the basket.\\n\\nSmall Foward-Well he is the guy inthe middle. He should be able to driblle (at least descent), rebound, drive and sometimes post up.\\n\\nPower Foward- This guy rebounds and is also accounted to score points down low and blocks shots. They also should be able to set a pick since they usually set the most picks/screens.\\n\\nCenter-This guy rebounds,blocks, scores down low.
The one side of the moon is always facing the earth, so when the moon rotates around the earth one time, it also spins on it's axis one time. It's probably called geosynchronous or something like that.\\n\\nThe moon also deviates up and down on the horizon, so we do see it's north and south poles a little more or less each time. I remember reading that we've actually seen 59% of the moon facing us.\\n\\nThe other side is called the "dark side" of the moon. But in fact it 'sees' the sun as much as the side that faces us. I guess it just 'dark' to us.

That's what hippies were and are.\\n\\nAt least in the 60s the hippies wanted to start their own communal societies.  We could handle that, they were not such a hindrance to the mainstream society.  But today's hippies are far worse.  Now they want to stay within our mainstream society, enjoy the benefits of the group, but refuse to do anything productive themselves.

i've never made out with a girl, but if i wern't in a serious relationship i'd try if the situation came up. just to find out the answer to that question( r girls better?), i've heard it a lot too. i really don't think the ability to kiss well is confined to one gender i think it's an individual thing. my bf's kisses are perfect but i've kissed some guys who needed a little work. i'm not sexually attracted to girls but i am comfortable enough to admit that there some hotties out there. Hi hotties!!!

You can reference "Water Cycle" on google, and you should get plenty of hits, along with illustrations. The basic process is:\\n\\nEvaporation-heat turns liquid water in water vapor, sending it into the air\\nTranspiration-plants and animals give off water vapor, sending it into the air\\nCondensation-water vapor cools, turning into water droplets\\nPrecipitation-water droplets become to heavy to float, falling to earth as rain or snow\\n\\nMany people include Runoff in the cycle (returning the precipitation to large water sources such as lakes and oceans)

marketocracy.com is a fun and cool site where you can make mock trades. Your friends can join in on a "club" and everyone goes head to head as a mutual fund manager. I think you are given $100k to invest, one stock cannot be more than 25% of the portfolio,while the rest have to be less than 5% or so. It's fun because it allows you to compete just with your friends and the site will tell you if you are beating the S&P500 or not.\\n\\nCHeck out investors.com if you want good info on how to buy the right stocks at the right time. Open an online discount brokerage account like scottrade.com . Trades are only $7. That way you won't have to pay the $50+ the big brokers charge.\\n\\nWith good research and a bit of luck you can triple your $1000. I did that with Apple. I bought it at $17. \\n\\nBest of luck.

how are you coping!!!!!!!
You mean 3^2 = 5^2 - 4^2 ... dimensionally this works.  For examples, if the units are feet, then you can take a bunch of one foot by one foot ceramic floor tiles, and arrange them in a 5 by 5 square, then take away a 4 by 4 square chunk of that, and rearrange what remains into a 3 by 3 square of tiles.  Translated into inches, you get (3*12)^2 = (5*12)^2 - (4*12)^2: if you have a whole lot of one inch by one inch tiles, and you make a big 60 by 60 square out of then and remove a 48 by 48 subsquare, then you can rearraqnge the remaining little tiles into a 36 by 36 square.\\n\\nNow consider 3^5 = 243 = (122 + 121)*(122 - 121) = 122^ - 121^2, again in feet.  When you translate that into inches, it doesn't scale the same way: the left hand side is multiplied by 12^5 but the right hand side is only multiplied by 12^2.  What kind of geometrical figure do you want to use given that it does not scale?  "Take a bunch of little one by one by one by one by one foot hypercubes, and arrange them in five space ... then when you project along the ... the result looks like ..." ??? "... but subdivide each hypercube into 12^5 little one inch by ... hypercubes and what you just did no longer works".  Is that really what you are looking for?

Jupiter, while larger than all the other planets in our system put together, is still far too small to have ever been a star in its own rights. Furthermore, stars don't just "burn out". Depending on thier mass, they can undergo a number of different evolutions; many will go super-nova, spewing out unimaginable ammounts of heavy atoms and radiation, others will diminish into brown or whites "dwaves", still others will form black holes. \\n\\nIt might be possible (though incredibly unlikely) for a solar system to "ensnare" passing planetoids, but they would be unlikely to form stable orbits in the time that our solar system has been around.\\n\\nIt's an interesting idea, and although jupiter could never have been a star, it is proponderously unlikely, but not impossible, that it could have originated outside of our solar system.
I don't know what you mean by terminal endpoints linearity.  I've never heard of it.  Are you simply linearizing a function?  If so, you should be able to see how to do it in any calculus text.  As for the line of best fit, check out the least-squares method.

real love is basically a feeling of attachment that transcends lust/desire, and is more a attachment that can be found between soul mates: people who will tell each other everything on their mind, people who aren't afraid of and know they will not be judged by the other, people who can understand each other even without saying a thing.  Thus, real love does not necessarily have to deal with romance etc., but true/meaningful romance should include true love.
As someone said, you still have as many as 9-10 years left to reach your full height! My wife says she actually grew an inch between age 20 and 22. \\n\\nMuch of it is genetic (how tall are your parents?). Our kid is 6'4" at age 16, but I'm 6'3" and my wife 5'7". Both of us had one tall parent (dads) and short moms, so obviously, one side may "win out".\\n\\nFirst, make sure you are eating enough calories. (see the Healthy Body Calculator at the site below) Eat plenty of protein, for your muscles and calcium-rich foods, for your bone growth, and carbohydrates for energy. If you don't like dairy, leafy green veggies have calcium, or you can take a supplement. Make sure it's Calcium CITRATE, since it's absorbed better, and combined with magnesium.  You can also get foods enriched w/calcium, like cereals and juices.\\n\\nExercise is important (strong muscles stimulate bone growth and strength), as is the proper amount of sleep. Teens need at least NINE hours a night, and they often don't get it, so make sure you don't stay up too late. \\n\\nAvoid the pressure to be too thin, as this will stunt your growth. Also, avoid cigarettes, alcohol and any drugs (obviously).\\n\\nSome prescription drugs can interfere with growth, such as anti-anxiety drugs, anti-depressants and others. Check with your doctor (if you're on any of these) to see which ones you can switch. \\n\\nYour problem may just be that your are maturing more slowly than your peers, which is usually normal. If lack of growth continues, however, check w/your doctor to test for things like thyroid problems (and other endocrine (gland) disorders) and diabetes.\\n\\nIf you follow healthy eating, sleep and exercise, you should catch up to your peers soon. Also, you may never become as tall as most others, but don't let that interfere with your self esteem. Many attractive women are actually shorter (J-Lo, for instance) Don't worry!

First, to correct one of the last posters, Ad-Aware's website is http://www.lavasoftusa.com.  It's most likely a spyware issue, or maybe even a virus issue but that's less likely.\\n\\nThe reason this happens is because sites that have http:// in the front of them are using port 80 to communicate.  When the site has https:// that means port 443 is being used, and that connection is secure.  So there is something that is blocking, interrupting, or taking over the communication flow for HTTP traffic.\\n\\nGood luck

This is the slippery slope. How do we demand that other countries do not torture our soldiers, if we have no problem torturing theirs?\\nThis was the basis for the Geneva Convention. Everything is fair game during the battle, but, if captured, you were effectively taken out of the war, and as such, would then be treated in a more humane manner.\\nA principle, that I think, a lot of countries strived to maintain as best they could. Was every prisoner treated humanely?  Of course not. Any time you throw humans into the mix, you aren't going to have perfection...no matter how noble the idea.\\nBut to have a government itself support the concept of torture, invites other countries to do the same. Is this really what we want for our soldiers?\\nAnyhow, I don't think torture is a very effective tool. Physical, anyhow. People can only withstand so much pain before saying anything just to make it stop. Including making things up. There are more effective tactics out there.

Actually, any aquarium pump will work.  To make smaller bubbles, the air should pass through a diffusing element or stone.  This will have small pores and a relatively large surface are to release the air pressure slowly over a larger area.  This results in smaller bubbles. These are available for purchase at a store that sells the aquarium pumps.\\n\\nYou could also probably make one by plugging the end of the regular aquarium pump hose, and perforating it as much as you need with a needle.  Some testing is required, but you should be able to find the right hole (needle) size, and the number of holes to meet your need.

why do you feel like you belong there? Is it because you really feel that the teachings are the truth? Or is it that Friends and family or congregation members make you feel welcome and at home? God expects us all to seek him, if you feel that this is the right place for you maybe it is for now? However, if you do not agree with the teachings, feel that they dont come from God, or you are not getting the answers you seek, you would be wise to look at why you want to stay. If you value your relationship with God, pray to him and ask him to guide you, and teach you the truth. If you are just shy, it would not take long to settle in somewhere else if you feel that you need to move on. Trust God. You might also get alot of negativity from people on here because many feel that morman is a cult, i am going to be baptised as one of Jehovahs witnesses soon, and i get ridiculed sometimes, i dont mind though, because i trust in God to take care of me, and i am loved by him, and my brothers and sisters. They are close to me as if they are related. I can count on anyone in my congregation to help me if i need it, that is how it should be. Jesus said:\\n“I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another.

There is more genetic variation between some tribes in Africa than there is between those of African descent and those of European.\\n\\nAll humans have the same DNA structure. Thus, no, the DNA Structure of a 'black' person is not different than that of 'white' person, they are essentially the same with minute variations.

I understand homosexuality is not illegal in S.A., but his situation is very difficult from what you say. In my opinion, what he could do –I know it can be difficult- is keep aside his sexual trends for the time being so that his father may regain confidence in him and at least, allow him to get a degree in some career or other. And when he has finally being able to start an independent life of his own then he will be able to openly show his sexuality in South Africa or wherever he chooses to live.\\nAfter all, there are thousands of young men that do not start having any sexual activity until they get married, although you may find it hard to believe, and that means finishsing their studies first and finding a job afterwards.\\nLife is not always easy, and you can tell this youn boy he will not die if he tries to disguise his true feelings for a few years and behave accordingly.\\nCurious98

Good question. It's the sort of thing that seems so obvious -- but everyone has a different opinion about just what the correct answer is. In some parts of the world, sunrise happens when you can distinguish between a black thread and a white one - in other words, when the day begins to become light. In other places it isn't until the sun is actually on the horizon. It's pretty spectacular to watch the sun rise in the Grand Canyon -- it literally runs down the walls of the canyon, revealing things you never see at any other time of day, until it hits the bottom of the canyon. \\nThe actual definition must have to do with daylight, because if it were when we saw the sun on the horizon, that means there would never be a sunrise on a cloudy or rainy day. \\n'But that's just my opinion.

Arnica could be found at specialty health food stores and is great for not making your clothes smell.  I know some tennis professionals use it, so that is why I am recommending it to you.

Could mean a lot of different things depending on the context. It could be that the office where your company's payroll gets processed is closing temporarily, like for a holiday. Or maybe you have multiple locations where payroll is processed and they're downsizing by closing a few (but not all) of the locations. Or it could be in reference to the end of the year--- they are closing the year so you need to submit your payroll information a little earlier than usual so they can pay everyone on time and still finish out the annual bookkeeping.  Could you please give more detail about how this statement was made?
The Soviet Army left!  Then Austria was able to become a neutral country, but also democratic, free and with a capitalist system (with a strong welfare state).  The Soviet Union was a catastrophe for Austria.  They killed thousands (including my grandfather's younger brother, who was shot in the head in front of his parents on his 16th birthday), raped thousands of women, burned and destroyed many building and shipped scientists, experts and even factories down to the bricks to the USSR.  Political expression was restricted and people were mostly poor.  The signing of the State Treaty that declared Austria’s neutrality (and the withdrawal of the USSR Forces) was an event without which Austria could never have become what it is today.\\n\\nThis is also the period of shared power between the Austrian people's Party (OVP) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP).  They ruled in a coalition almost the entire time (the exception was when one controlled the executive alone, but only for a few years).  They used to be enemies and even fought a low-level civil war in the 1920s, but the Nazis treated them both equally terribly, so party leaders realized that the other party wasn't nearly as bad as they thought, and that things could get a lot worse, and were able to cooperate a bit better once they had a chance to regain power.\\n\\nThis power share ended in 1999 when the Freedom Party of Austria (FPO) won 27% of the vote, which put them in second place after the SDP.  This obligated the SDP to form a coalition with the FPO and the chain of continuous power sharing between the OVP and SPO was ended.  The next elections yielded an OVP-FPO coalition, although since then the FPO has lost a lot of popularity and did poorly in regional local elections getting a fraction over 10% of the vote), followed by a defection of many FPO leaders to form a new party, the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), so it is likely that the SDP and OVP coalition could be back on during the next national elections. \\n\\nPeople made a big fuss over the FPO making it into the coalition, but I always thought that they were a bit stupid, as the FPO had won 22% of the vote during the previous parliamentary elections, which was not enough to get them in the coalition but still pretty close, so the fact that they managed to pick up five more points wasn’t exactly the political shock many outside of Austria liked to pretend it was. I really don’t like the FPO and I’ll be glad to see them go, but they aren’t Nazis.  They are just a very conservative European party, and the other countries lead by other European parties threatened by similar parties in their own countries took the opportunity to denounce the FPO in an effort to similarly denounce their own rivals.
After looking around some, I was unable to find out his parents' names, but I did find that his mother was a homemaker and his father was a shipping clerk.  Hope that helps!!
The periodic table is divided into sections by chemists in order to make it easier to talk about elements that behave in similar fashions.  The periodic table makes this possible by organizing elements by the number of electrons in each orbital.  The transition metals, the family that platinum and Iridium both belong in, is made up of elements that in their elemental (as opposed to compound) form have a d orbitals as their last filled orbital.  This gives them some similar properties and ways in which they will react.  Which is why scientists call them families.
Ok, so I met this girl at church. Beautiful indian girl, so my natural macho instinct drew her to me. Some months later she invited me over for lunch, everyone else went inside the house so I was getting ready to make my move, then.................bbbrrrraaaaaaappp!! That girl farted up something  wicked, I swear I was going to die or that she was already dead! She was very embarrased, she ran into the house came back out and apologized like a million times. The damage was already done, I never spoke to her again.

1A Use 'any one' of things and of person when 'one' has a numerical sense : Which pen do you want? - Any one will do.\\n1B At all other times use 'anyone' of persons : Is anyone there?\\n\\n2A 'Anyone' is singular and normally takes a singular verb and is referred to by a singular pronoun : Has anyone a book he can lend me?\\n2B When anyone has the force of 'all', without exception, the singular would sound out of keeping and the plural is normally used : Anyone can enter for the Art Contest, can't they?

So, he wept.  Was it the humanity in him that longed to know his friend was still there on earth with him?  Was it his unknowable love for all mankind and his abhorrence for sin and it's consequences that made him morn over the death.  Indeed he knew what he would do.  Or perhaps he hadn't received instruction from God to go raise him yet, so he stayed put until that time.  Did he have things that had to be done where he was at, knowing that a resurrection could take place at anytime if he so desired, and thus it could wait, yet still had to express the very real emotion of pain, sorrow, and sadness that sin has wrought upon all the world and the very essence of life itself?\\n\\nthings to consider, and answers in themselves.\\n\\nLike all the mysterious things Jesus did (and does) it is for the glory of God. Why was the blind man blind? Because his parents sined? No, but instead so the power of God can come through and be glorified.  Likewise, his waiting period before rushing to Lazarus' grave was for the glory of god, and that all there might know that he is the Son of God.  This seems to me the most logical and likely.  Remembering Gods ways are not our own.

Steve JOBS\\n\\nJobs worked at Apple for several years with an annual salary of $1, and this earned him a listing in Guinness World Records as the "Lowest Paid Chief Executive Officer". At the 2000 keynote speech of Macworld Expo in San Francisco, the company dropped the "interim" from his title. His current salary at Apple officially remains $1 per year, although he has traditionally been the recipient of a number of lucrative "executive gifts" from the board, including a $90 million jet in 1999, and just under 30 million shares of restricted stock in 2000-2002. As such, Jobs is well compensated for his efforts at Apple despite the nominal one-dollar salary.
Time travel is completly possible. \\n\\nwhen Albert Einstein released his theory of special relativity, he laid the foundation for the theoretical possibility of time travel. As we all know, no one has successfully demonstrated time travel, but no one has been able to rule it out either. \\n\\nIf you travel at the speed of light, time stops for you, not for other people. So say you travel at the speed of ligt for a week in space, when you come back to earth youll find that its been maybe 100 years in the future.\\n\\nI also know a russian astronaught (<--- Spelling wrong) that traveled a fraction of a seconed in the future. This is because he was aboard the russian space station. If you travel fast enough for a long period of time its possible.\\n\\nThere is a scientist that is building this machine, its suppose to be able to send particles into the future or past i forgot, but when this person turns the time machine on, he could start getting messages from the future.\\n\\nBut yes time travel is possible.

Parole is getting out of prison early.  During the time out early, strick rules governing where one lives, works, interacts with others and such must be followed or it's back to prison again.  \\n\\nEarly release on parole is based on good behavior.  (Although some people are sentenced to prison with no chance of parole regardless of how good the behavior.)  But even if someone has the chance of parole and has good behavior, they might not get out if their crime was horrendous or if the victim or the victim's family actively object to parole.  \\n\\nThat's pretty much what I understand of it from watching TV.
Come to Canada, there are lots of jobs, and we welcome people from all nations. People of different nationalities live together, work together and do their best to accept each other's ways.

Normally an Information Server is used within a company intranet to give out time, date, calender, etc information to the users on the network. Typically it is used to distribute files, programs, and information sent by one person to another person or to several people. You would use this in a company that needs to share out digital memos, calendered events, email between users in the company, etc. You could also use this type of server in an environment with dumb terminals or a client/server networking scheme. While a Web Server is primarily used to send information to people outside the company. It is used to set up the website, distribute the website, and hold all the website's resources, coding, and security. You would use this type of server if your company had a large website, or a medium sized website that you wanted to keep secure and distribute out over the internet. It can be done other ways though a Web Server is the preferred method.
You could go in a round about way and ask them personally. Some people may be allergic to some chemicals contained in cleaning solutions or may be sensitive to certain scents. \\nYou could just call and ask that anything you bring to use will be OK for these reasons and they may respond that you can just use what they already have allergies or not.\\n\\nDefinitely be prepared regardless.

If you are that unsure, you really should be discussing your feelings with your current steady.  He would probably prefer you bring this out into the open instead of stringing him along.  You also should be asking yourself which person would make you happier.  No matter what decision you come to, being honest with yourself and everyone else involved is key.  You risk losing a friend, but in life you are solely responsible for your own happiness.
You shouldn't be getting any worms....\\nMaggots are fly larvae - meaning that flies have laid eggs in your food (you've seen flies attracted to rotting food, I'm sure). the eggs hatch and the larvae slowly grow until they form a pupa and transform into an adult fly.
see if you can get them both at the same time
Dude.  Mentos and Diet Coke.  Sweet.  Someone's already mentioned it, but I will be a good scientist wannabe and provide a little more information here.\\n\\nI think diet has more oxygen than others.  You could test a couple of different sodas to see.  It's showing a physical reaction between the nucleation sites on the candy (imperfections, etc. that allow bubbles to form) and the gas in the soda.  The gas wants to form bubbles, and a nucleation site is where it can do so.  The candy sinks to the bottom of the soda bottle, making the reaction last awhile.  All those bubbles have nowhere to go but up.  \\n\\nYour experiment could be to see what soda does it the most, or what candy has the most nucleation sites (for six year olds, you could call them "bubble sites" or something).  Have them guess why the bubbles go up.  They might be able to figure out that it is because bubbles are made of gas and gas is lighter.  Hmm.  That brings us to solid, liquid, and gas; something they might have heard about in science class if they've been in first grade.\\n\\nYou'll want to try it at home first (but as a good camp counselor, you already know that).  \\n\\nAnother avenue you could explore is ecology.  Something like which food ants will eat first.  If you flood an ant hill (be careful they aren't the biting/stinging kind of ants), you can watch them evacuate their colony and carry their larvae away in a struggle for self-preservation.  That's kind of mean, though.  I bet they'd love to play with Mentos and Diet Coke.  I'm sure you could do a wonderful job explaining to them about bubbles and getting them to hypothesize about where the bubbles come from.\\n\\nGood luck!
Children, sometimes cry if they do not know you, because they are scared of strange people or if they are kids from friends of yours there is a simple solution to your problem. Playing peek-a-boo with them if they are small babies would make them warm towards you. If older try to start a conversation by telling them your name and asking them theirs. And remember that children can sense when a person is sincere.

This is not your fault. Better communication about likes and dislikes helps, but ultimately, it's up to the female. It's always beeen sociaaly acceptable for a guy to have and enjoy sex. It's not so much with the female. Our body image, past trauma, fear of being caught, inability to REALLY let loose and enjoy the act, etc. can hinder any possibility of orgasm.\\nPersonally, i couldn't if I am not in love with a guy. It's true. the berst sex for me is with the man (my man) I am head over heels for. I do have to say though, that I agree with the "getting her (close to) drunk".
Never heard of any lists, but rats are very intelligent, probably more so than a dog. A rat isnt supid enough to fall for tricks that dogs do(like pretending to throw a ball and the dog still chasing it). Rats can be litter trained, learn their names and learn lots of tricks.
I agree with you 100% .  I too am an athiest, but I have great respect for the teachings of the religions, whether Islam, Jdaism, Christianity, Hindu etc.  The basic belief is summed up by the Christian commandment of "do unto others..." \\n\\nThe problem comes when we get an "our god's better than your god" type of confrontation, because that is just using religion as a tool to promote racism, and that is absolutely against everything that most religions stand for!\\n\\nI'll get off my soap box now.

Teacher of course. \\nBeing a teacher, you could influence kids to do better in life. While being an actress, you're playing a role sometimes have nothing to do with dignity or respect and for so many people who watch you thinks you're like that already, so no one really respects you. \\n When it comes to who earns more, a famous actress earns more but then do they truly find "happiness and peace of mind" for what they do? I don't think so.

Before we were conceived we were in a place sorting out things from our previous lives, getting ready for when we would start all over again as the baby of someone else (usually in the same family as we had been in before).

There are PLENTY of us that do stuff such as that.  If you go look at the blog entry I did today (http://sinthyia.blogspot.com/) you will see that many of us DO care about what is going on and do our best to help and bring awareness.  Despite how the media and others portray us we are not party animal slackers, we know the issues and pay attention and get involved with causes.  The media never shows that though.  We know we are the ones that, in a few years, will be the leaders and make decisions that count and decide how things are run.  We take that seriously!  We know the issues today and what is wrong and what needs to be changed.  We are involving ourselves with them and trying to get the changes made that need to happen.  We pay attention to the issues and follow politics. So don't be so hard on us, we are doing things just not the way things were done in the 60's, but in our own way and fashion.
Supreme Court decisions, by definition, cannot be appealed.  They are the court of last resort.  They don't call them "supreme" for nothing.  Once your case has reached the supreme court of whatever jurisdiction you may happen to live in, you're done.  If we were talking about, say, the Supreme Court of Alberta, you could theoretically appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, but as you were already there, you have exhausted your legal options.

I assume you are talking about Windows XP SP2. It is so much better than service pack 1 because it includes so many more security and performance fixes than sp1. It takes up so much space because it is a lot of fixes, has some new features, and it has an uninstaller. Yes, you can roll back to SP1, so it needs a lot of backup files. Don't ask me why, I don't get it.\\nThe new features are Win XP yelling at you if you don't have Firewall or Antivirus software, or if it is off or outdated. Also, it has a lame firewall. Still better than nothing though.

Have a question more than an answer - where do you look for guys?  What are your true interests in life and do you try to meet men while doing those interest?  One final question - are your standards so high that no one can possibly meet them?  Yeah, I guess if you could just place an order and zap, there that person is might be nice.  I don't think there are ever any "perfect" matches, but that is what makes life truly wonderful - experiencing what either has to offer.  He is out there for you - you just have to be patient.

Marijuana actually has many helpful benefits toward diseases / sicknesses. Marijuana can reduce nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite caused by AIDS. It can Reduce interlobular pressure, which alleviates the pain and slowing and sometimes even stopping the progress of glaucoma. Common side effects of chemotherapy are nausea, loss of appetite, and vomiting, all of which marijuana would help. It can limit muscle pain and relieve tremor nad unsteadiness of gait for multiple sclerosis patients. Marijuana can help prevent epileptic seizures in some patients. It can also alleviate chronic, often debilitating pain caused by myriad disorders and injuries. Each one of these applications have been deemed legitimate by at least one United States court, legislature, and/or government agency.
I have my Bachelor's Degree in English and these are weird sentences to try to teach you parallelism, but here goes:\\n\\n1)  The students were questioning many rules and questioning how they should act.\\n\\n2)  William Blake uses rhyme and he uses moral(?) to express his feelings about the loss of innocence.\\n\\n3)  Mike both studied algebra equations and he studied how to conjugate two verbs in Spanish.\\n\\nI hope this helped you see what parallelism is.  After you use a conjunction like and, or, etc. you are linking two sentences together and should almost have a sentence that looks the same on the other side.  That's how I remember it.  I think a simple sentence is:  "He learned how to play the piano and he learned how to play the violin." \\n\\nGood luck :)

Contrary to popular belief, Escheria coli is totally harmless to humans.  It is only the agressive mutant E. coli 0157 that is deadly.  The amount required to kill someone varies totally.  Remember "there are no absolutes in a biological system".  A child, a pensioner or a person who is immunocompromised will die when subjected to a much smaller dose than a healthy 20-something male

Yes.  If you want to be a citizen you should respect the country that you are applying for citizenship in.  If you move to a country it is very arrogant of that person(s) to think that, that country should bend over backwards to accomodate their wants and needs such as religious orders.  Britain is a christian country yet it has done a lot to accommodate other religious factions,  yet when christians go to some muslim countries they can not practice christianity or drink alcohol because its against the muslim beliefs.  I respect this but believe that they should do the same in other countries. It goes with the adage 'when in Rome do as the Romans do'.  Its about time that people are stopped being seen as racist just because they want their country to think of their wants and needs before the immigrants.  If you don't want to be disliked, join in with the country and speak the local language when outside of your home.  Terrorists who have claimed British citizens should have that revoked and returned to their country but those that were born to that country should serve a life sentence.  Or to upset a lot of people receive the death penalty if they caused the death of others.  Unfortunately that is no longer an option in the UK thanks to the Europe Union interferring again.

The bullet has much higher kinetic energy than the gun.\\nThe bullet and the gun will have the same MOMENTUM but the bullet has more energy. (And a good thing for the shooter!) Kinetic energy is calculated using the mass of the object and the SQUARE of the velocity, while momentum is calculated using the mass of the object and the velocity. \\n   If the bullet and the gun were equal in weight they'd have the same energy AND the same momentum - and the shooter would have an injured hand.

Sugar (as in the normal stuff you buy in bags from the store) is a good source of energy and rather than make you slow will in fact make you fast.  A better option would be glucose (one of the several different types of sugar) as the body breaks this down into energy very quickly.  Many top atheletes use glucose to boost their performance.  It's best taken in the run up to the game and during the game as well.  You can take it in powdered form, diluted in water, syrup or as candy.

Women's clothing isn't measured the way men's clothing is measured. Frustrating but true. Ask any woman who wears a size 8 in Gloria Vanderbilt jeans but a size 10 or 12 in another brand. That's why women have to spend so much time trying on their clothes. Men can buy a size "38 long" jacket and know it will fit because men's sizes are measured in inches. For women's clothing, it's all arbitrary from one brand to another... or even within the same brand. So there is no correct answer to your question.
I don't think this statement of yours is not true. Let me tell you why: I've dated Blacks, White and Latinos. White men can be just as aggressive as a Black man or a Latino man. The only shy white men that I've encountered are white collar men (business suit wearing men). Blue collar white men such as construction workers, electricians, plumbers, mechanics, all handy men, there is nothing shy about these guys. I've dated them, I know! They are just as romantic and funny and sensitive as any other cultured man. I've dated only 2 business men and they are more reserved because they have so much swirling around in their heads. Such as the almighty dollar bill. So don't get it twisted sweetie. A man is a man the private parts are just a different color! Take it from someone that has dated a lot of different nationalities. Haven't dated an Asian yet! But some of them are quite cute as well. Things that make you go emmm!

Life is full of lies. It's never justifiable but look it's life. Not reason to go back to square one. Chances are it's not going to be better there. Accept it. Chances are love grows. If the relationship doesn't improve over years, shrug, and don't worry about it. Very few have a pleasant marriage after 20 years with the same person. It's just an accepted pain.
Factoring is another method of solving the problem.  In your first example, you could write:\\n\\n0 = x^2 + 4x + 3\\n\\nwhich is equivalent to:\\n\\n0 = (x+1)(x+3)  <----  This is factoring the quadratic\\n\\nOnce you have it factored, you can solve the problem by setting either factor equal to 0, such as:\\n\\n0 = (x+1) which solves as x=(-1)\\n0 = (x+3) which solves as x=(-3)\\n\\nIf you plus -1 or -3 back into the original equation for X you'll see that they are indeed correct solutions.

That's a really awesome question!

I've studied those religions, have friends of those religions (and others: Pagan, Buddhist, Baha'i, etc).

My happiest times are at Happy Hour - I'm happy to not be at work, happy to be with friends, happy to consume cheap drinks. There is breif disappointment when the clock hits 6 or 7 (depending on the establishment), but I just stick around and wait for Reverse Happy Hour (who ever came up with that is brilliant) and my happiness is restored.  For real ... what is there to not like about happy hour (another question in itself).

It's Jahn-Teller effect, not John Teller.\\n\\nJahn-Teller distortions occur for transition metal complexes where by distortion of the molecule can result in a lower energy state for the molecule.\\n\\nIn transition metal chemistry, bonds from ligands to the central metal atom are coordinate covalent, i.e. both electrons come from one atom.  The orbitals which contain those electrons bond with usually the dz2 and dx2-y2 orbitals from the metal, but are lower in energy, so the orbitals based on the metal are essentially anti-bonding orbitals.  The dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals are mostly non-bonding orbitals, but their energies do go up somewhat upon bonding interaction.  In a typical octahedral bonding arrangement, the dz2 and dx2-y2 are degenate, as are the dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals (they have the same energy).  In certain electron configurations (the classic example is d9), if the system can make those orbitals non-degenerate by lengthening or shortening bonding interactions along a certain axis, it can lower the overall energy by putting electrons in lower energy orbitals, which is why you will often see Cu2+ complexes where some bond distances are longer than others.

The Prophet said to him "Let him drink honey." The man came for the second time and the Prophet said to him, 'Let him drink honey." He came for the third time and the Prophet said, "Let him drink honey." He returned again and said, "I have done that ' The Prophet then said, "Allah has said the truth, but your brother's abdomen has told a lie. Let him drink honey." So he made him drink honey and he was cured.

As you probably know, it was mainly used only in high level electronics, especially in the aeronautics industry, until the widespread introduction of the catalytic converter where it is used as the catalyst to reduce smog components in automobile exhaust. This gives it quite an edge over other metals, a widespread application which actually uses up the material. However, its price in relation to gold has far outstripped its relative usage, and I think a lot of speculation is involved considering other possible applications such as fuel cells. I would expect increased demand through automotive applications for at least the next twelve years, by which time we may see some shift to new technology, but still at least level demand.

Greenwich Village would be in New York so definitely in the Eastern Time Zone.  On the other hand, if you mean Greenwich in England then there are two answers.  Local time in Greenwich is 8 hours ahead of Pacific Time or 5 hours ahead of Eastern Time (about 9:42 am).  However, the Universal Coordinated Time (which timezones are based) is actually an hour earlier.  The distinction is that Greenwich is on Daylight Savings Time now, just like the U.S. but UTC does not change.  It would be 8:42 am UTC.\\n\\nGMT and UTC are often used interchangeably, but they aren't the same thing between April and October, as you can see.  So the question is which one do you truly mean?  GMT or UTC?

Hi, let me tell you something about that IUD. I had it for six years and I hated it. Please don't let me discourage you from getting birth controll, but, that IUD was painful. No it didn't make me gain or lose weight, but it gave me the worse menstrual cramps there ever was. I took all kind of pain medications there was and nothing helped the pain. I cried sometimes because it hurted so bad. I was so grateful the day I got rid of that dam IUD and I've been happy since. I'm sorry to tell you all the bad effects it gave me. Different strokes for different folks, try it and see.    GOOD LUCK
Marijuana is classified as a depressant.  This is an oversimplification.  It has many depressant effects, like the relaxation you refer to, but it also stimulates the brain's frontal lobes, where "executive thought," or "higher order processing," occurs.  This means that the area of your brain where you do most of the thinking that you're aware of is stimulated, so you're going to have more thoughts than usual flowing around up there.  Some people are mentally strong enough to use these thoughts constructively, and we call this "being creative."  Some people cannot control their thoughts, and we call this "being paranoid."  Some people can usually control their heads, but in certain situations, cannot.  So the subjective experience is different for every person, every time.  \\n\\nI had a creative writing teacher once who discounted all drug stories.  "You don't really know if that's insight, you were just high, and that was just a drug thought," she would say.  She was completely wrong.  You get to take credit for every positive thing you do on drugs, just as you are responsible for every mistake you make, high or sober, as if it makes a difference.

One way to do it is to make Class1 call some other class for all actual implementation. So you make a new class, Class1Impl, which does all the real work. Class1 has a pointer to Class1Impl, and all of the member functions of Class1 call the appropriate member function of Class1Impl. You don't need to give out the header for Class1Impl as it can just be predeclared at the top of the Class1 declaration. \\nEx:\\n//class1.h\\nclass Class1Impl;\\n\\nclass Class1\\n{\\nprivate:\\nClass1Impl* m_pImpl;\\n\\npublic:\\n  Class1();\\n  void DoStuff();\\n};\\n\\n//Class1.cpp\\n#include "Class1.h"\\n#include "Class1Impl.h"\\n\\nClass1::Class1()\\n{\\n  m_pImpl = new Class1Impl;\\n}\\n\\nvoid Class1::DoStuff()\\n{\\n  m_pImpl->DoStuff();\\n}\\n\\n//class1impl.h\\n//hidden, never give this source out\\nclass Class1Impl\\n{\\nprivate:\\n  long m_lHiddenVal;\\npublic:\\n  void DoStuff() { printf("Woo! %d", m_lHiddenVal); }\\n};
Cranberry juice won't help much, they are easy to get rid of at the hospital so don't worry. I'm a nursing sister and have a broken kidney (smiles.) So listen to you're aunty Buscemi Babe because I'm promising you there is nothing to worry about, the Doctor will even give you the stones afterwards if you ask.\\n\\nHand on heart, once they are out he'll be fine and wondering what all the fuss was about.

Ice cubes do not float on all liquids. For example, if you place your \\nice cube in a cup of light oil (thin cooking oil. Don't use heavy greasy \\noils), it will sink. It depends upon density of oils, density of oil is less than water in other words oil is less denser than water thats why it floats on water. If you put ice in more denser oil like heavy greace oil, ice cubes will float on this greace oil.\\n\\nWhy do things float on water? This has to do with something known as \\nbouyancy. It's because of bouyancy that ships can float on water, \\nas can corks and other things. It's also the reason that Archimedes ran \\nout of his bath naked screaming 'Eureka!' all those years ago. \\n\\nThink about a tub of water or a swimming pool. If you push your hand in, \\nthe deeper you go, the harder the water pushes on your hand, because the \\ndeeper you go, the more water there is above you that's weighing down on \\nyou. Same with air. If you climb high into the mountains, there is less \\nair over your head, so it doesn't push on you quite as hard any more. This \\nis the reason your ears pop when you go very high very fast. The \\npressure of air in your ears is different from that of the air \\noutside, and it is released in a 'pop'.\\n\\nIce cubes float on water because it is less dense than water. \\nDensity measures how much mass there is per volume. For example, if you \\nhave a metal cube and a plastic cube of the same volume (same length, \\nwidth, and height -- same size), the metal cube is denser than the plastic \\ncube. Most people would say 'the metal cube is heavier', and that's \\nbecause it's more dense, so there's more matter per unit of volume than \\nthe plastic cube.\\n\\nWhen an object, like an ice cube, is placed in water, the water pushes \\nagainst the object, this is called 'exerting a pressure on the object'. \\nhis pressure can come from below as well as from above. If you're not \\nusing water, and use honey or some other liquid that is denser than water, \\nthe pressure will be higher. If you use oil or some liquid that is less \\ndense than water, the pressure will be less. The object itself has a \\nweight, and is being pulled downwards by gravity. The more mass the object \\nhas, the more strongly it is pulled downwards by gravity. If the downward \\npull of gravity is greater than the upwards push of the liquid against the \\nobject, then the object will sink. If the gravitational pull is less than \\nthe upwards push of the liquid, then the object will float. If the two \\nforces are the same, then the object will just hang there, neither \\nfloating nor sinking.\\n\\nTbe ice cube floats not only because of its density, but because of its \\nshape too. Imagine a huge ship. It's made of lots of heavy metal and \\nsteel, but it still can float. This is because of its shape. It is made to \\nspread out wide over the water, so that there is more water that can push \\nup from below to balance out the weight of the ship. If the ship were just \\na solid cube of metal, then it will sink, because the force of the water \\npushing from below, the bouyant force, is not enough to balance out the \\nweight of the ship, and it sinks.\\n\\nI hope this explanation helps, and if you have any more queries, feel free \\nto ask us Have a great time!
Look you take your time, find someone you want to be with, don't go for someone just cos your mates are doing it, u'd be letting your principle's down and yourself, and if your mates take the Micky they're not such good mates after all... and as for every thing else you've asked advice on it'll will all come to you naturally i promise.. you seem very cool for your age and you'll figure it out.. when kissing don't have wet lips and for god sake don't stick your tongue down they're throat straight away.. take it slow u'll be great good luck
Well, the wind is not a strong enough force to go against the force of motion that propells things forward. And thats if there was any wind getting into the bus, but it has four sides including a windsheild so I don't see how thats possible.
From what I understood in your question is that you have two objects (two frames of references), S and S'.\\n\\nEach are side by side, the first object is moving at a constant velocity, u, along the +y axis.  Meanwhile, S' moves at a constant velocity, v, at some angle away away from the y axis in the +x direction such that S and S' stay parallel with eachother.\\n\\nDiagram:\\n\\nS------S'\\nS----S'\\nS---S'\\nS--S'\\nS-S'\\nSS'\\n\\nYour question did not mention that either object was travelig anywhere near the speed of light, so we can use ordinary Newtonain relativity for this.\\n\\nIt is just common sense that since S' is moving at an angle away from S and yet stays parallel, it must be moving faster...but how much faster.\\nWe know that the +y velocity is S (u) much eqaul the +y velocity of S' (v).  So we know that,\\nv*cos(angle) = u\\nor to rearrange,\\ncos(angle) = u/v,\\nso angle = cos^-1(u/v)

This date was chosen to coincide with the Roman festival marking the birthday of the unconquered sun. (the new encyclopedia britannica) pagans held ceremonies to get this source of warmth and light to come back from its distant travels. December 25 was thought to be the day that the sun began its return. In an effort to convert pagans, religious leaders adopted this festival and tried to make it seem "Christian."

I once put in my two week notice at my job and the day after I put in my notice they asked me to leave.  They did not fire me.  I asked if I was being fired.  On applications I put that I quit and the reason that I left.  Mostly put "Looking for a wider range of experience," or something like that.  I always tell them that they can call my previous job.  My job can't say anything bad about me or else it is slander.  They can say that you did work there and that they would or would not hire you back.  All other employers will give you a chance to explain why you left.  Just don't speak badly of your previous employer.  If you were fired they will say that they won't hire you back.  If you quit they can say that you are rehirable.  Since they did not say that you were fired you can say that you resigned.

No one should be treated as disrespectfully as that ... With a TEXT msg? Saying he was now single?. He sounds colossally immature and doesn't know what he wants or what he had with you. The way you are feeling now will subside and new and more exciting things will come to you. If he loves you, he will find you and be all that he should be and more, but he is not going to do it while you sit there and wait on him, allowing him to treat you like a part time pal/gf. Move on, make your own decisions and stop letting someone like that control your heart, head and choices!! This too shall pass my dear! :) \\nGood luck and thinking of you!

Humans have the following blood types along with their respective antigens and antibodies:\\n\\n    * Individuals with type A blood have red blood cells with antigen A on their surface and produce antibodies against antigen B in their blood serum. Therefore an A-negative person can only receive blood from another A-negative person or from an O-negative person.\\n    * Individuals with type B blood have the opposite arrangement, antigen B on their cells and produce antibodies against antigen A in their serum. Therefore, a B-negative person can only receive blood from another B-negative person or from an O-negative person.\\n    * Individuals with type AB blood have red blood cells with both antigens A and B and do not produce antibodies against either antigen in their serum. Therefore, a person with type AB-positive blood can safely receive any ABO type blood and is called a "universal receiver". However an AB-positive person cannot donate blood except to another AB-positive person.\\n    * Individuals with type O blood have red blood cells with neither antigen but produce antibodies against both types of antigens. Therefore, a person with type O-negative blood can safely donate to a person with any ABO blood type and is called a "universal donor". However an O-negative person can only receive blood from another O-negative person.\\n\\nOverall, the O blood type is the most common blood type in the world, although in some areas, such as Sweden and Norway, the A group dominates. The A antigen is overall more common than the B antigen. Since the AB blood type requires the presence of both A and B antigens, the AB blood type is the rarest of the ABO blood types. There are known racial and geographic distributions of the ABO blood types. \\n\\nThe precise reason why people develop antibodies against an antigen they have never been exposed to is unknown. It is believed that some bacterial antigens are similar enough to the A and B glycoproteins, and that antibodies created against the bacteria will react to ABO-incompatible blood cells.\\n\\nApart from red blood cells, the ABO antigen is also expressed on the glycoprotein von Willebrand factor (vWF), which participates in hemostasis (control of bleeding). In fact, blood type O predisposes very slightly to bleeding, as vWF is degraded more rapidly. ABO antigens are also present in many other tissues such as liver, kidneys and lungs\\n\\nThe H antigen:\\nThe A & B antigens are derived from a common precursor known as the H antigen. The H antigen is a glycosphingolipid (sphingolipid with carbohydrates bonded to the ceramide moiety) which is modified to produce the A and B antigens. In type O blood, it remains unchanged and consists of a chain of glucose, galactose, N-acetyl galactosamine, and fucose attached to the ceramide. Since it lacks N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) it is referred to as a globoside, not a ganglioside. Type A has an extra N-acetyl galactosamine bonded to the galactose near the end, while type B has a third galactose bonded to that near-end galactose.

Usually they are separate, but there are some states that house those inmates with the rest. That decision depends on the individual inmate. Just because someone was criminally insane at the time they committed the act does NOT mean they are still insane. Infact, if you are found criminally insane you are, essentially, found "not guilty by reason of insanity". The court does NOT have to take any further action and can release the individual back to society. After all, they are "not guilty". Now, if you have a CONVICTED person who is later deemed "insane" they can be housed with the "general public" in the jail, or they can be moved to a secured facility such as an asylum.

Scientists don't even know what gravity is.  They know how to measure it and account for it in calculations but don't know how it's generated.  They know it's one of the weaker forces in the cosmos and have identified a particle they call a graviton.  Once it is known how gravity is generated the next step will be how to counter it, or develop anti-gravity.

when something is acute, it is small, and sharp.  think of the triangle, with acute angles.  i always remembered them as 'a cute little angle'.  it is quite sharp, and tiny, much like the description acute as it describes a condition (usually a pain)\\n\\nthe word chronic comes from chronos, which means time, an unending flow.  a newspaper might be called the times, or the chronicler.  anything with the word 'chron' means that it involves a lengthy period of time.  when it is used to describe a pain, it means a pain that you've had for years.  it eases up every now and then, but for the most part, it is the same pain that keeps coming back again and again.  such as a migraine headache.

On big football days, two of these wolverines were brought to Michigan Stadium and carried around in cages. \\nHowever, the animals grew larger and more ferocious, and as Yost states, " It was obvious that Michigan mascots had designs on the Michigan men toting them, and those designs were no means friendly." Therefore the practice of bring wolverines into the stadium had to be discontinued after only one year. However, one of the wolverines was not returned to the zoo. Instead "Biff" was put in a cage at the University of Michigan Zoo where students were able to visit him at times. In 1937, the Chevrolet Motor Company donated a wolverine (as well as a cage to keep it in), to the University of Michigan. It was unclear how long this wolverine lasted, but it is known that no live wolverines have been in the stadium in the last half century. \\n\\n\\nIf a Wolverine was the size of a bear it would be the strongest animal on the planet.\\n\\nI know what you should absolutely not name your football team\\n\\nThe Spartans....

That questions is flawed because it assumes that emotional intellignece or strength is a function of gender alone.  Upbringing, position within society, quality of home life, etc...will all influence emotional stability.  In general, one can not presume that males are emotionally weaker than women.  Some men are emotionally weaker, some women are emotionally weaker.  Some people, regardless of gender, become stronger with their emotions over time while others become weaker.\\n\\nTheir is no steadfast rule concerning this.  And just because somebody is emotionally weak now, does not mean they will be emotionally weak in the future.

Don't worry about other people judging you. Your income and debt has nothing to do with you being irresponsible. The fact that you are trying to do something about it, that to me shows absolute responsibility. The good thing is that there are financial counselors out there who are willing to listen to your situation and make recommendations that best fit your needs. In my opinion your best option is to contact these counselors to seek out your options.\\n\\nThes programs are known as debt management programs and here's how they basically work:\\n\\n1) You have lots of high interest debt. Perhaps the high interest rates are making it very difficult for you to make any progress. So what do you do?\\n2) You call a credit couneling company. I can't speak for all companies, but the ones interested in the consumers show care and compassion because they understand you are in a difficult situation. This is sometimes all someone needs. Someone to just listen to, but if the counselor finds that a debt consolidation WILL help, then they will walk you step by step through the program. Okay so you qualify now what? \\n3) You enroll your high interest debt into the program and the company will begin contacting your creditors to negotiate lower interest rates on most of your accounts. This is a tremendous help because interest consumes most of your monthly payment anyways. Another important thing that you have to remember is that the creditors also CLOSE your accounts. This is to further help you along in paying off your debts. But what do you have to do?\\n4) You stay in contact with your consolidation company and creditors. But you only make ONE payment to the consolidation company, who in turn forward it to your creditors. Then what?\\n5) Sit back and watch your debt slowly disappear! Regardless of the debt, it typically takes a person 4-5 years to pay off your debt. As each account is paid off, your payment is then redistributed among the remaining accounts. It's a snowballing effect, where the payments to your creditors get larger as each account is paid off. \\n\\nIn choosing a company you also want to look for these things:\\n\\n1) A company who is genuinely trying to help consumers: A company who is looking for the consumer's best interests will not only counsel you, but they may take you through a budget, analyze your situation, provide free financial material, etc. In other words they don't just try to enroll you. You should never feel pressured.\\n2) A company who is non-profit, certified, and has a good track record with the BBB. A company who is non-profit may ask for a donation but it is purely voluntary. All your payments should go to your creditors. Also there are regulation agencies in place to weed out the "shady" companies, so you should make sure they are certified and a responsible member of the BBB.\\n3) A company that answers all your questions and whose counselors are also certified. You probably have lots of questions, but a caring and knowledgable counselor will walk you through step by step, and explain thoroughly every step of the process and its affects on your credit.\\n\\nThe reason I am a big fan of this method is because I myself am on a debt management program and I was once a financial counselor! My overall experience is a smooth one and it probably has something to do with the fact that I saw how the DMP (debt management program) worked behind the scenes. As far as my debt goes, in about 18 months, I have gone from $14000 debt, to about $8500. That's a big leap for me, and it's only going to get better as the payments get larger when accounts begin to close. It's a great system and more people need to take advantage of the great opportunity creditors have given consumers through the DMP. My credit score wasn't bad to begin with but it has increased from 695 to 723.\\n\\nSo if you are interested in the company I worked for, it is http://www.incharge.org . It is based in Orlan

The rule, as always, is to stay away from those that ask you to pay before you can get these surveys. \\n\\nLegitimate market survey companies such as Pinecone Research recruit members based on demographic characteristics -- e.g. mothers of babies 0-12 years old -- and will send surveys of products and services targeting this demographic group. Pinecone Research, however, pays only $5 per survey -- you're definitely not going to be rich with that. They can give you anywhere from 1-5 at most surveys in a month. \\n\\nOther companies simply ask you to answer as many research as possible, and you don't earn anything just the chance to win at a raffle (which I find lame).\\n\\nThe article "Earning Money from Surveys" provide a short list of legitimate market research firms and contains explanations of what to look for when joining surveys (and weeding out the fraudulent ones)\\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol121/onlinesurvey.htm \\n\\nPinecone Research http://www.pineconeresearch.com\\nGreenField Online http://www.greenfieldonline.com \\nHarris Poll Online http://www.harrispollonline.com  \\nBuzzBack http://www.buzzback.com  \\nSurveySite http://www.surveysite.com \\nSurveySavvy http://www.surveysavvy.com\\nSurvey Spot http://www.surveyspot.com/\\nhttp://www.internetpaidsurveys.com/

The least complicated and most effective solution is to leverage the backup product you already have, and call the appropriate API's to back up your mail databases as part of your regular backup routines.\\n\\nIf you're an end user and not a tech, you won't have the access rights to run a batch file or anything else against the mail server so your only choice is to manually forward the existing emails to a personal account somewhere. That'd be each person forwarding all their own emails. You *may* be able to set up a "rule" to forward any new, incoming mail but you won't be able to forward the existing mail other than manually. And many mail systems block outgoing mail if it's bound for the Internet and has been automatically forwarded, for security reasons.  If I were an end user, I'd check with the IT folks to see what they're doing for backups--- you may be worrying about something that's already been taken care of for you. (I get the feeling there's been a major outage somewhere in the recent past for you?)\\n\\nIf you want to discuss further, feel free to send me a message offline--- click on my avatar then click the "Send email" link (or whatever it says).  Especially if you are a tech. I am positively frightened for you, if you don't have a current backup mechanism in place for your emails.

There are a number of utilities in pursuit, the question is who will be the first?\\n\\nToday's reactor core technology should allow the operators to leave the controls and 'walk away and get pizza' from a reactor that has experienced some operating difficulty.

If you have Windows XP or Windows 2000, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Take a backup. In case things get mucked up, you have something to go back to.\\n\\n2. Boot up your machine to Windows.\\n\\n3. Right-click on My Computer and click on Manage.\\n\\n4. In the left hand tab, click on disk management. The corresponding right hand tab would should you the disks you have installed along with partitions. The linux partition should be shown as "Unknown" or "Not Recognised". \\n\\n5. Right click on the Unknown partition and select "Format". This is the final frontier, and if you format the disk, there is no way going back to linux, (not easily anyway). \\n\\n6. Once format is done, assign a drive letter to it and the new drive with all its empty spaces should show up in your windows explorer.\\n\\n7. We are not done yet, assuming are using a boot loader (GRUB or LILO), you still have to remove that or you will be stuck at a LI or a grub> prompt. You may need the Windows XP/2000 CD, so keep that handy. \\n\\n8. Reboot, if you can see the boot loader, select Windows, and you should be fine.\\n\\n9. In case you cannot, boot with the CD and select the recovery mode. \\n\\n10. Once you get to the recovery console prompt, type "fdisk /mbr" and reboot once you get back the prompt.\\n\\n11. Enjoy Windows!!\\n\\nIf there is anything you do not understand above, DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS AS IT MAY SCREW UP YOUR SYSTEM AND YOU MAY NEED PROFESSIONAL (READ COSTLY) HELP IN YOUR AREA. Better leave it to a local guru or have one handy atleast.\\n\\nEnjoy!!\\n\\nYou should backup anything you think is valuable to you. It could be source code, photos, important lettes, documents, excel sheets, etc. etc. Basically whatever you cannot live without.

It depends on the amount of energy in time used.\\n\\nKilowattsX56.92=BTU/ per minute   This one tells us how many BTU's can be generated per minute per kilowatt\\n\\nKilowatts-hoursX3415= BTU      This one tells us how many BTU's for each hour a kilowatt is consumed\\n\\nSo therefore the answer to your question is 56.92 BTU's per minute, or 3415 BTU's per hour. Generally when we talk of BTU's to heat a pool or a hot tub we are referring to the BTU"s per minute. So it is possible to figure the kilowatt usage for each hour of operation of the appliance by dividing the BTU's by 56.92.
I personally believe that Baptism is just an outward expression of an inward change.  Baptism is important as a symbol of your new birth through Christ and should be followed through by new believers, but I believe that if theoretically, someone died in between accepting Jesus and the baptistery, they would still go to Heaven.

If you think back about your relationship, you will probably realize that she was using and abusing you all along.  It didn't just happen.  Unfortunately, "love is blind", and sometimes we are so caught up in the relationship that we can't see what is really happening.  Sometimes we are so infatuated with the other person that we choose to close our eyes to all the hurtful things they do, hoping it will get better.  But things will only get worse until we say "enough!"  Remember you are of value.  It is an honor to be with you, not a right.  Expect more respect from the other person.  If you truly give unconditional love, then you should expect to get it back.

Sorry, this isn't really any help, but I have the same problem.. I've been doing regular exercise, including weight training and cardio for months, with a personal trainer that I see every two weeks, and I haven't lost an ounce! My trainer says I'm probably losing fat and gaining muscle weight, and the same goes for you I'm sure, but any addiitonal weightloss has to come from a healthy diet and drinking lots of water, according to my trainer! Good luck, I know how hard it is!!!
First off, don't even think about sex unless you're both gonna be in a relationship. If he's a virgin, you should cherish that and and really to connect with him emotionally and spiritually and not only will the sex be OUTSTANDING but your relationship will last. When the talk of sex comes up between you just make sure he's ready and discuss protection and because you're more experienced try not to scare him with advanced techniques ;) if you know what I mean! Just be true to yourself and make sure he does the same because the worst feeling in the world is to regret your first time and have bad feelings towards the person who took your virginity, trust me, I'm speaking from experience!! Have fun!
Cute.
Here's an article from TIME Magazine that should provide some comfort and ideas for you:\\n\\nWhy Abby Can't Talk\\n\\nShe has a condition called selective mutism that is neither as rare nor as hopeless as experts believed. But the right help is hard to find. \\n\\nAbby Barnes' hand shoots up nearly every time her teacher asks the 19 squirmy first-graders in her suburban Philadelphia public school to match letters of the alphabet to the sounds they make. Sitting up front with her pinchable cheeks framed by long blond hair, Abby, 7, looks as eager as any of her classmates to blurt out an answer. But every time the teacher calls on her, Abby freezes. Her face tightens. She strains to respond. And even if an answer manages to get past her lips, her words are inaudible. She's effectively mute throughout the school day--even at recess, where the closest she will come to open communication is words whispered to a trusted girlfriend.\\n\\nAt home, however, Abby is a different child. She loves to play cards and board games and frolic with her brother Jack, 5. "She speaks loudly--sometimes too loudly--and can be bossy toward her brother," says mother Lisa Barnes, who runs the trading desk at a money-management firm. Abby is, in every other way, a perfectly normal child who has no shortage of extracurricular activities, including horseback-riding lessons and dance classes that she's been attending since she was 4. "Performing in public is fine," says her mother. "She likes people to look at her and applaud."\\n\\nSo why doesn't she speak up in class? What may at first glance look like shyness or obstinacy is actually something far more complex--and much more interesting. Abby, like hundreds of thousands of kids across the U.S., is suffering from a little understood but increasingly recognized childhood disorder called selective mutism.\\n\\nThe key to selective mutism, or SM for short, is the seemingly incongruous behavior Abby exhibits: voluble in private, silent in public. According to the official psychiatric diagnostic manual DSM-IV, a child who has developed normally at home but has not talked at school or in other social situations for at least a month is a strong candidate for a diagnosis of SM. Experts once believed that fewer than 1 in 1,000 kids developed the disorder, but an influential study three years ago in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry put the prevalence at closer to 7 in 1,000, making SM almost twice as common as autism.\\n\\nSM can strike at any age, even among children who once talked in public, but it usually becomes obvious by age 3 or 4, when peers are happily jabbering away. About 30% of kids with SM also have a developmental speech impairment, which can exacerbate the problem but is generally not the cause. In the past doctors often recommended speech therapy, but treating the physical or neurological issues alone will probably have little impact on the underlying psychological factors behind SM.\\n\\nThe root of the problem in most cases is an extreme form of social anxiety or phobia. "It is a fear that can literally make it impossible to speak," says Dr. Elisa Shipon-Blum, a Philadelphia-based clinician who specializes in treating selective mutism. As with most social anxieties, SM is more common in girls and is believed to have a strong genetic component. About 70% of kids with SM have an immediate family member who also struggles with social anxiety.\\n\\nCompared with childhood disorders in which children are disruptive and disorderly-- such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)--selective mutism gets less attention and considerably fewer research dollars. "These children are ignored because, let's face it, they aren't causing anyone trouble. They are literally left alone and forgotten about," says psychologist Lindsey Bergman, associate director of the UCLA child and adolescent OCD [obsessiv

There is a book called "Overthrow : America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq".  It talks about 14 cases when the US became involved in another country. ie) panama, nicaragua, hawaii, iraq, iran, cuba, and more. The author was a foreign correspondent for the New York Times and says how the countries where the US became involved in, were worse off than before the Us became involved.  He also says that the US becomes involved in other countries basically to protect US international business.  ITs a great read.

Yes, but no one knows where that point is.\\n\\nGovernment debt increases the cost of capital.  Capital is bought and sold like any other commodity.  When you buy capital, the transaction is called a "loan" or "mortgage."  Government debt reduces the supply of capital and thus increases the cost (interest rate) of borrowing money.  This inhibits business by making it harder for businesses and individuals to borrow money.\\n\\nIf government debt becomes too large, business comes to a standstill and the economy would be in danger of collapsing.  No one thinks that the US economy is in danger of standing still or collapsing from government debt.

I was 15. Bad idea. It wasn't with anyone I really liked, just a friend. Here's some advice; wait until you find someone who loves and appreciate you. When the time is right, you'll know.

The rule of thumb is:\\n\\nWhen you are having sex, see a GYN.  If your Pap-test is clear, you can miss like 2 years...otherwise you are supposed to have one every year.\\n\\nIf you are already having sex, it won't be a big deal for you.  The exam is short and to the point.
Guys who are secure and confident in themselves will ask out girls they are truely attracted too. So the answer is not, definitely, yes. If he hasn't asked you out, he may just want to be your friend but, more likely, he might really be interested in you but not sure enough of himself to ask you out. If he wants too but doesn't, then you don't want him anyway. He sounds afraid, confused and frustrated to me because he is sending you mixed signals. This would suggest that he want's to ask you out but doesn't know how to, or is afraid of rejection. He probably is intimidated by your age. Sounds like an infatuation and he's trying different approaches to feel out the best way to grab your attention. I could be wrong but he doesn't sound very mature or experienced.

Millions of years later there was an ice age.  Animals use the ice as passageways to other lands.  Many died during the crossings.  This supplies us fossil fuel.\\n\\nAs far as the effects of the ice melting im afraid I could find no information on that.... sorry.

In nature, living things evolve through changes in their DNA. In an animal like a chicken, DNA from a male sperm cell and a female ovum meet and combine to form a zygote -- the first cell of a new baby chicken. This first cell divides innumerable times to form all of the cells of the complete animal. In any animal, every cell contains exactly the same DNA, and that DNA comes from the zygote. \\n\\nChickens evolved from non-chickens through small changes caused by the mixing of male and female DNA or by mutations to the DNA that produced the zygote. These changes and mutations only have an effect at the point where a new zygote is created. That is, two non-chickens mated and the DNA in their new zygote contained the mutation(s) that produced the first true chicken. That one zygote cell divided to produce the first true chicken. \\n\\nPrior to that first true chicken zygote, there were only non-chickens. The zygote cell is the only place where DNA mutations could produce a new animal, and the zygote cell is housed in the chicken's egg. So, the egg must have come first.

only water weight, the only way to actually lose fat weight is by doing cardovascular exercise, so running, biking, swimming, rollerblading.  Be your own trainer and nutritionist, the basic rules to losing weight are no soda, no fast food, lots of chicken, fish, fruits, vegies, whole wheat stuff, yogurt. Not so many cakes and donuts and cookies. Basic common sense for eating, you just need to enforce it. Get all the bad stuff out of the house right away, just toss it or give it away while your still motivated. No alcohol if that applies. Some juice but make sure its all natural, because the ones that aren't are loaded with sugar and a leading cause in diabetes in children and adults. Lots of water, 3-4 liters a day, not all at once, but spread out. Its really easy to down a liter or two while your watching tv or on the computer. Also drink some after you eat the bigger meals of the day, it helps your body pick out the nutrients in food when your food is more spread apart.  These rules may be hard to adapt to at first so start with cutting out the things you know you can live without.  Then work to there.  Remember these are  perfect eating habits, it can take you a while to work into it.  If you know you can’t live without your one treat a day, don’t fight it by trying to eat something else, just eat it and make sure that’s the only one you cheat on a day.  Otherwise you’ll get depressed and quit.\\nAs for exercise, lots of cardio. Find something you like. If you have never exercised much before, start with walking 30 minutes a day at a brisk pace. Move on to different terrains that include hills and increase the time spent. After a week or two, try jogging the route. No matter what find an activity you enjoy. Walking to jogging is just an example, try hiking, rollerblading, biking. Once you get into a regular routine, if your not happy with the level of difficulty, try signing up with a gym. Spinning, pilates or kickboxing classes are great. It will also introduce you to working with weights. Talk to a trainer for instruction before using any weights. A cheap investment is a balance ball, it works you stomach while your just sitting on it, like at your computer and its great for posture. There are hundreds of exercises you can use it for for your entire body. I can give you some ideas if you want, just email me.

Thunder is the sound of the shockwave caused when lightning instantly heats the air around it to up to 30 000 °C (54 000 °F). That super-heated air expands rapidly, then contracts as it cools. The rapid expansion/contraction generates sound waves, making the sound that is called "thunder."

Our parish was one of the first in the U.S. to be named in honor of St. Pius X, the "Pope of the Eucharist." He was so named because he established reception of the sacrament of the Eucharist by children. His life, in part, was modeled after St. Vincent de Paul with the deep understanding that "the will of God is not to live for oneself, but for all others." \\n\\nBishop Edward A. Fitzgerald, Bishop of Winona, established the Church of St. Pius X on July 1, 1954. Msgr. Warren J. Ryan was appointed the first pastor and was responsible for the planning and development of the parish facilities during the first nine years. The first liturgies were celebrated at Miracle Mile Shopping Center, which served as a temporary church until March 1955. From that time until August of 1955, services were held in Lourdes Chapel at Assisi Heights. The fist Mass was celebrated in the social hall (Kennedy Hall) of the new church Roncalli Hall), on the feast of St. Pius X, September 3, 1955, and at that time the combination school and church building were formally dedicated by Bishop Fitzgerald. The cost of the three structures (Kennedy Hall, Roncalli Hall, and the parish rectory) was $245,000.00. The church had a seating capacity for 600. The social hall could seat 400, and was used for basketball, school lunch, and social gatherings, much like it is today. The parish rectory was originally just one story. \\n\\nThe school (built at a cost of $250,000.00) was opened for the first classes a year later in September 1956 with an enrollment of 325 students in grades one through eight. Preliminary plans included construction on only eight classrooms, but demographic studies indicated much growth, prompting a decision to expand the school size to 20 classrooms. The school would eventually include 19 classrooms, a library, an office and nurse's room, to serve up to 750 students. \\n\\nDuring the parish's first pastorate, that of Fr. Ryan, the parish grew from 300 families to 800 families. Besides the erection of the combination church and school, the rectory and convent were completed and preliminary plans were made for the new church. During the next eleven years, St. Pius X continued to grow in numbers and facilities, and soon became the largest parish in the Diocese of Winona. The new church was erected at a cost of $404,000.00 in 1964.

While all AMD processors now support 64 bit processing, the Sempron processors are AMD's "value" line, run at somewhat lower clock speeds, and have less L2 cache on chip, making them much less expensive to manufacture while still providing very good performance. (see link 1) The AMD Athlon 64 and 64FX processors (links 2,3) run at higher clock speeds and have more L2 cache, providing excellent performance, but costing much more to make than Sempron.  Athlon 64 X2 is AMD's dual core CPU, providing more stable operation for tasks such as video editing.

You need very good support from your family and you need a partner that will be there for you no matter what, and because they are hard to find I wouldn't recommend it. \\n\\nYou may think at that time that you and him are going to be together for ever (I thought the same thing) but him and I are no longer together. True love is hard to find and you have to think about finance and support from family members no matter the age you are when you get pregnant.

Percentile is supposed to mean the percent of all the people who took the test that you scored HIGHER than.  Since you can't score higher that yourself your percentile shouldn't be 100.  It's usually referred to as 99.9. This assumes that it was impossible to score more than 100% (no bonus questions), and that 100% meant your child got all the questions right.

Not enough info to answer this question.  If he is your son, why aren't you asking him?  I'm sure he would explain his rationale to you.\\n\\nMaybe he feels like he needs to be there to protect her and, since he isn't married, he is free to do that.  If you are divorced from her, he might feel that he needs to protect her since the world isn't always safe for women.\\n\\nHe probably pays rent and helps her to afford the place.  Maybe she doesn't have enough money to afford to live on her own.  Many women end up in poverty after a divorce.\\n\\nAs I said, these are only "guesses" since you haven't given any background information so don't take any of my "maybes" personally.  Just saying you need to ask him since we don't know the entire story.
I was stationed in Berlin Germany right during the fall of the Berlin Wall and East Germany was coming out from under Communist control. There was a story of little children in an art class after communism fell and were told they could draw anything they wanted and none of them drew anything. When asked they explained that they had always been told what to draw. Also another interesting thought is that state approved car in East Germany was made of a wood frame with a plastic exterior body and a 2-cycle engine (the size that is used on your push mower).
Perhaps you should remind him that Christianity is a religion of love, and by rejecting all these things, he is instead spreading a message of hatred and intolerance. Also, remember that story of the good Samaritan? Well, the Samaritans were Pagan
Music participation provides a unique opportunity for literacy preparation. Whether the children are singing, playing, or listening, teachers direct them to listen and hear in new ways which exercises their aural discrimination. Playing instruments and adding movement to the lessons teaches children about sequential learning which is essential in reading comprehension. \\n \\nPlato once said that music “is a more potent instrument than any other for education”. You will find many teachers of young children who would agree with him. Recent research has found that music uses both sides of the brain, a fact that makes it valuable in all areas of development. Music affects the growth of a child’s brain academically, emotionally, physically and spiritually.\\n\\nMusic is academic. \\nFor some people, this is the primary reason for providing music lessons to their children. A recent study from the University of California found that music trains the brain for higher forms of thinking. Second graders who were given music lessons scored 27% higher on proportional math and fractions tests than children who received no special instruction. Research indicates that musical training permanently wires a young mind for enhanced performance.\\n\\nMusic is physical. \\nMusic can be described as a sport. Learning to sing and keep rhythm develops coordination. The air and wind power necessary to blow a flute, trumpet or saxophone promotes a healthy body.\\n\\nMusic is emotional.\\n Music is an art form. We are emotional beings and every child requires an artistic outlet. Music may be your child’s vehicle of expression.\\n\\nMusic is for life. \\nMost people can’t play soccer, or football at 70 or 80 years of age but they can sing. And they can play piano or some other instrument. Music is a gift you can give your child that will last their entire lives.
If you mean a man and wife (who are in the same family), then yes, by all means.\\nIf you mean two second cousins (who are usually allowed to be married by law), then once again, yes.\\nIf you mean brother and sister or parent and child, then it is never a good idea and is illegal in most places.  The child will probably be normal.  Only continued interbreeding (over several generations) will lead to problems.

Why Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb or nuclear reactors? If America is the safest country to have nukes, why did they drop them on Japan when only conventional war was taking place? Why the world did not take CRUCIAL ACTION against America then and why should anyone take crucial action now on Iran when they have not even officially built a nuke bomb? If it is assumed that the Islamic terrorists can buy a nuke from considerate govts, they what is the guarantee that they cannot buy the same from western powers including USA? There are so many channels through which technology can be routed. Cannot some one buy it from PAKISTAN which is the cheek by jowl buddy of the USA? So why no one is complaining about or condemning USA being in touch with Pakistan and giving them all state of the art techy war stuff? THERE IS NO WAY INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN TAKE CRUCIAL MEASURES against Iran's nuke program.

Let's see...they've taken about 20 years to get this far when all they had to do was buy much of what is needed...and all the instruction manuals had already been written.

At your young age, it would be best if you did not pursue marriage or children at this time; you will appreciate this advice later.  You may be bi,  know what you are and what you want in life before you start involving children.\\nFollow your heart, ignore fundamental Christians.  I'm a Christian, and think they are bigots and way off base.  If you really feel f****d, then see psychological counsel who is educated, but not working through some church.  Listen to his professional advice.  Often one session would do.  Also explore non-judgmental churches if you are Christian or interested.  The Episcopal Church is a good place to start.  They are welcoming and non-judgmental.  Some things are definitely between you and God, not the large haired ladies, and wild fanatics that visit this room so often to spew hate.  When in doubt, read John 3:16, feel secure and safe.  Watch out for the bigots, they can be murderers while preaching love.
You're an idiot.  And the Apocrypha is idiotic.  Lots of false history, mixed in with true history.  There's a reason it's not in the Bible.\\n\\nGood luck with your new religion.
You could do something on home schooling vs public school - compare rates of learning, values clarification, success rates afterwards and levels of involvement with family in both situations. Just a thought. And I think you are looking for Montessori for the pre-schools.

The key to this problem depends much on the type of your mobile phone.\\nA plain SMS is just a text message. To attach something to a message, you need to send an EMS (E for Extended) or a multimedia message (MMS). \\nAn EMS is basically an SMS (160 bytes at most, usually) that embodies simple black-and-white images or ringtones.\\nIn MMS-es you can attach one or more images or ringtones (MIDI or WAV) to a text message.\\nIf the phone model allows it, you can purchase a USB data cable to transfer data to/from the PC, or you can use wireless technologies, including IrDA and Bluetooth (the PC must be equipped with an appropriate adapter).
How old are you?\\n\\nI am an adult so it doesn't matter if my parents know or not. LOL.  However, age is a big factor.  My space is a dangerous place for especailly the younger generation.

Show you dont do anything unsafe, all your friends are people they knwo and can contact.  you don't want to get hurt in bad ways, trust me!
i would say leave but i know you love this guy and maybe he will realize his situation bad and will thing will get better so just threat him you gonna leave him if he didn't get job and see just give him another chance,good luck
It is one of those proverbs that must go way back in history. The dog was first domesticated some 14,000 years ago, so the thought must go back a long ways. In English, it was first cited in Great Britain in 1709 and in the United States in Girl in Black (1927) by V. Bridges.

I like the spin you put on the typical "What's your favorite song?" question. To answer I'd have to say "Losing my Religion" By R.E.M. That song just always manages to take me away. I like getting lost and feeling like I own the song. Silly but it's true.

I'm on it now, but if you only have 25 lbs to lose, you don't need it.  It's a serious drug--DRUG--with side effects--including addiction. (I have one friend who is addicted.)  It's NOT for losing 25 lbs.  Were you checked out by a doctor first?  \\nI've lost almost 40 lbs since February on it, but I'm morbidly obese. The drug was designed for people like me--not you.\\nI wouldn't subject my body to insomnia, headaches, dry eyes, thirst, hot flashes and now withdrawal if I only had to lose 25 lbs.  \\nBe careful, that's all I can say.
I sure do, especially when they make excuses. I read an answer here on that neocon pastor and his male prostitute: "The closer to God you are, the more the devil tries to get you" or something like that. Anyone not a Christian who does the same is just evil to them, but when it's a Christian, they point at the devil.
Hmm, not really. Thanks for the 2 points though friend. Good luck.
That would be very tough to do indeed. If you want to do a little risk taking then you could go to a casino. One that has single zero roulette. Pick black or red, the previous number hits don't matter. Pick a color and then when the dealer has spun the ball, slap that cash on your color. The risk is that you may lose it all. If you win then you have made  your cash and walk away. You almost have a 50/50 chance of winning. The odds are slightly in the Houses favor with use of the zero. 100% risk and 100% reward.
Probably an example would help. \\n\\nI am an American with a BA in Journalism.  News writing is different throughout the world, but the main difference between Newspapers and tabloids in America are their objectives. \\n\\nNewspapers seek to inform and Tabloids seek to entertain. Now, of course these two areas cross over. Sometimes the tabloid will strike gold, and get a great scoop, and all newspapers seek to entertain as well as inform.  \\n\\nHowever, as a general rule, newspapers are more objective, less likely to print rumors, and will follow journalistic guidelines for obtaining, and printing a story.  \\n\\nI do not read American tabloids, because I would not want to mix fact and fiction in my mind, nor spend time reading gossip about people who would rather remain private.

Yes, that is the URL for this website.  What is your question?
Fire is an energy-releasing plasma.  I think it's more correct to call it a plasma because fire dies, but the energy it liberated remains, and the plasma--meaning the ionized gases--cease to exist once the fire is dead.

Take a look at this:\\n\\nTop 10 Democratic Sex Scandals in Congress\\n \\nFound this list at Human Events Online\\nWhat Rep. Foley did was evil immoral and reprehensible. I hope he is fully punished unlike the below listed Democrats.\\nhttp://www.humanevents.com/lists.php?id=17357\\n10. Sen. Daniel Inouye. The 82-year-old Hawaii Democrat was accused in the 1990s by numerous women of sexual harassment. Democrats cast doubt on the allegations and the Senate Ethics Committee dropped its investigation. \\n9. Former Rep. Gus Savage. The Illinois Democrat was accused of fondling a Peace Corps volunteer in 1989 while on a trip to Africa. The House Ethics Committee decided against disciplinary action in 1990.\\n8. Rep. Barney Frank. The outspoken Massachusetts Democrat hired a male prostitute who ran a prostitution service from Frank’s residence in the 1980s. Only two Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to censure him in 1990.\\n7. Former Sen. Brock Adams. The late Washington Democrat was forced to stop campaigning after numerous accusations of drugging, assault and rape, the first surfacing in 1988.\\n6. Former Rep. Fred Richmond. This New York Democrat was arrested in 1978 for soliciting sex from a 16-year-old. He remained in Congress and won re-election—before eventually resigning in 1982 after pleading guilty to tax evasion and drug possession.\\n5. Former Rep. John Young. The late Texas Democrat increased the salary of a staffer after she gave in to his sexual advances. The congressman won re-election in 1976 but lost two years later. \\n4. Former Rep. Wayne Hays. The late Ohio Democrat hired an unqualified secretary reportedly for sexual acts. Although he resigned from Congress, the Democratic House leadership stalled in removing him from the Administration Committee in 1976. \\n3. Former Rep. Gerry Studds. He was censured for sexual relationship with underage male page in 1983. Massachusetts voters returned him to office for six more terms.\\n2. Former Rep. Mel Reynolds. The Illinois Democrat was convicted of 12 counts of sexual assault with a 16-year-old. President Bill Clinton pardoned him before leaving office.\\n1. Sen. Teddy Kennedy. The liberal Massachusetts senator testified in defense of nephew accused of rape, invoking his family history to win over the jury in 1991.\\n\\nSee the difference between the Republican Foley and these Democrats is that Foley was ostracized and resigned. These Democrats, including the ones you mentioned, were re-elected countless times and rewarded by the Democrats. And then there is Nancy Pelosi's support of the Man Boy Love Association.
Wake her up to breakfast in bed and a buch of flowers (simple breakfast is good - cereal and toast with fresh orange juice and tea/coffee) Then take a long bath or shower together, nothing needs to happen but just having that intimate time together can often bring you closer. Put some music on and talk. Have a nice relaxing day together. Followed by a meal out for tea, doesnt have to be expensive, but that way she doesnt have to cook, and you dont have to fret over trying to cook. And drinks in a quiet pub that you are both comfortable in. Taxi home of course and a snugle in bed to finish the day.

Doppler analysis is the variation in frequency caused by motion toward or away from the observer. The classic example is the train whistle which sounds lower when it's moving away from the observer in the station or higher when it's moving toward the observer in the station. An observer next to the train, there will be no change (higher or lower) in the tone of the whistle. In fact, when the train comes by the station, the whistle tone when the train is next to you, is the tone an observer in the train (or when the train is just sitting still) hears. \\n\\nDoppler ultrasound for blood flow is much the same. The sensor is different (reflected high frequency sound) and the moving thing is different (fluid in tubes, ie, blood in arteries and veins), but the principle is the same. \\n\\nThere are of course, obvious differences. No one can stand right next to an artery and listen to the blood 'whistle' change tone up or down, and the moving thing (blood) is continuous, not a single thing like a locomotive, or even several of them.\\n\\nSo the ultrasound people have to do a slightly off line Doppler because they can't get right in line with the blood flow. It veers all over the place anyway as the arteries go from hither to thither. Look up one of those skeletal visible arteries human bodies and trace one of the arteries, say that big one on the inside of the thigh (it's the femoral artery). Not many rail straight stretches there.\\n\\nWhat is done instead is to look from the side at the artery, and calculate flow velocity from that measurement. More complex than the train whistle example, but it saves cutting into legs or whatever to get a sensor into 'in line' position. So what angle can be used?\\n\\nWell, neither 0 or 180 degrees are possible. Would have to dig in to get into position. And 90 degrees would be useless since it would look at blood flow from the side -- no relative motion toward or away to measure. Obviously, something in between (0 - 90 or 90 - 180 depending on your perspective) is the only practical choice. The actual path of the blood vessel being looked at (with respect to the skin surface where the ultrasound head will be) will affect the possible angles of the ultrasonic beam bounced off all that moving blood, but the favored angle you mention is probably dictated by the ultrasound machine (hardware or software) which may have limits of one sort or another. So for one machine the best angles may have to be between 45-60  degrees while another might range from 45-70 degrees. \\n\\nYou might want to check the manufacturer's web site, which might have a specification sheet or a user manual which would address the issue. A friendly physician or PA might be able to illuminate the issue, as might an ultrasound technician.
I think it is pathetic, there is no need to abuse anyone or anything, yes we all get angry and maybe say things we regret but if we realize our faults thats a start to maybe containing a little if not all the selfcontrol we have. Its all about teaching not only math, english, science etc. but teaching at a young age what selfcontrol is and how inportant it is. We are not perfect in my household but we do stress selfcontrol.

Almost all of the Psalms are songs. Psalms 150 speaks of using several instruments to worship - the lyre, the tambourine, trumpet, harp, strings, flute, and cymbals. The Jews used a lot of reptition in their music. God was praised by musical instruments, singing, and dancing. If these instuments were around when Psalms was written, they were surely around when Jesus came.
An emoticon, also called a smiley, is a sequence of ordinary printable ASCII characters, such as :-), ;o), ^_^ or :-(, or a small image, intended to represent a human facial expression and convey an emotion. Emoticons are a form of paralanguage commonly used in e-mail messages, in online bulletin boards, online forums, instant messengers, or in chat rooms, without them simple statements could be misinterpreted. Sometime during 1981, Scott Fahlman (now a Principle Research Scientist in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University), devised a scheme for encoding and conveying one's feelings in small text "glyphs" to overcome this frustration.\\n\\nLook up emoticon in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.The word emoticon is a portmanteau which popular etymology bases on emotion and icon. A similar portmanteau, verticon (based on vertical and (i?)con), is sometimes used when referring to the East Asian style of emoticon.\\n\\nThe smile is represented with a basic smiley :-). The colon represents the eyes, the hyphen is for the nose, and the parenthesis is for the mouth.\\n\\nMany variants exist with different symbols substituted for the basic ones. The symbol for the nose is often omitted, for example :) or ;). When the colon is replaced with the equals sign, =), the nose is almost always omitted (so one would not see =-), for example).
The word "Yahoo" was originated in English by Jonathan Swift in his tremendously influential novel of 1726, "Gulliver's Travels." In Gulliver's fourth journey, he visited a land populated by an intelligent race of horses called the Houyhnhnm, who are completely controlled by reason and rational thought. They dominate the a race of hideous beasts known as Yahoos, who are human beings in the same form as Gulliver. Gulliver soon befriends the Houyhnhnm despite his own Yahoo-like appearance and soon loathes the race of Yahoos. When he returns home at the end of his voyage, since the Houyhnhnms no longer are able to keep this Yahoo-like creature around, the novel ends darkly with Gulliver despising all human interaction and longing for the horse race. "Yahoo" is a term for a human being who is crude and boorish in all his desires.\\n\\nThe founders of Yahoo! have stated that the term they selected is an acronym for "Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Object," since their fledgling Yahoo! project was just another one of those internet sites assimilating information into digital form.

I still love Hendrix, I will never get tired of the Band of Gypsies from New Years Eve 1969. Some of the most brilliant Hendrix guitar playing ever. ZZ Top always makes me smile although I don't listen that much anymore. Don't get me wrong, I have most of their older albums. Led Zeppelin was brilliant, I loved Zeppelin I, II, and IV the most. I need to break some out since you made me think of it. Pink Floyd did some things that I just loved, "Shine on You Crazy Diamond", "Dark Side of the Moon", "The Wall", great albums, genius. I was a Hendrix freak when I was younger, then I was exposed to the Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia. So much of that music is so poignant and relevant to me and the way I experience life. I think it will be something in my life forever. In fact, I have had that same thought, about my funeral. I have a couple of Grateful Dead songs I want played. If you are familiar, I am going to have "Brokedown Palace" played. It almost makes me cry every time I hear it, a very beautiful piece. I also want to have "Sing Me Back Home" played too. I know it isn't a Dead original, but I just love to hear Jerry's voice on songs like that. I have decided to go back to school for a career change and I am there every day with a bunch of 18-19 year old kids. Most have no idea what any of that music sounds like. All they know is hip hop rap or death metal. I often ask myself if I too am a dinosaur. I'm right there with you.

The sun's radiant heat, heats the seats, etc.  The glass allows the radiation to penetrate into the car.  However, by convection, the air heats up in the car from the hot surfaces, and then the glass prevents the heat in the air from escaping.  This is a mini model of the "green house" effect.
You should say it when you really know that you do.\\nIf he feels the same way he shouldnt freak out, He might actually say it back. So just say it and dont be afraid.
Yes, it's a great island with much to do. It was quite violent a few years ago though.
it should really depend on your objectives.  if you have a good head financially, you would file single and claim 9 or 10.  your paychecks will be greater, but it will be up to you to "invest" that money so you can pay your taxes when they are due.\\n\\nif you file single and claim 1 (yourself), you will probably have a small refund or owe a small amount at the end of the year.  this, of course, is provided that you don't have any weird transactions.  (didn't buy/sell a house, no farm income, etc.)
First of all Christians aren't mindless. God doesn't want us to be mindless nor does he want us to have blind faith. He wants us to use our brain and think and question things and make decisions for ourselves. That is why he gave us brains and free will. God wants us to know what we believe and why and as such we must have our eyes wide open in our faith in Him. I have never forced my beliefs on anyone. Jesus has never done that either. He would give His opinion and have His say. Anyone forcing their religion or beliefs on someone is in the wrong. Even a Christian who tries to force their opinion on someone is sinning and needs to stop. Yes I will give my opinion on lots of things, especially when I see someone such as you making the comments or posing a question such as you have, but you are free to believe and think what you want. Yet it seems that most of those who are Anti-Christ and Anti-God want to have their say or make rude comments, but not let the Christians have their say. So now you had your say and I had mine and you can take it or leave it. The choice is now yours. John 3:3-6 and Ephesians 2:8-9
She may have a medical problem that causes the odor.  It could be a STD or something not as serious.  There isn't really an easy way to approach her about this problem.  But if I was you, I would suggest that we both go to the local clinic and have STD testing done.  At least that way you are protecting yourself from catching anything if that is the case.  Good luck.  But above anything else make sure you wrap it up!
Yes!! I actually learnt to type from her, I remember the "spelling/Typing race" was fun.\\nI'd recommend Mavis to anyone!
Jesus' public life begins with his baptism by John in the Jordan. John preaches "a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins". A crowd of sinners - tax collectors and soldiers, Pharisees and Sadducees, and prostitutes- come to be baptized by him. "Then Jesus appears." The Baptist hesitates, but Jesus insists and receives baptism. Then the Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, comes upon Jesus and a voice from heaven proclaims, "This is my beloved Son." This is the manifestation ("Epiphany") of Jesus as Messiah of Israel and Son of God. \\n\\nThe baptism of Jesus is on his part the acceptance and inauguration of his mission as God's suffering Servant. He allows himself to be numbered among sinners; he is already "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world". Already he is anticipating the "baptism" of his bloody death. Already he is coming to "fulfill all righteousness", that is, he is submitting himself entirely to his Father's will: out of love he consents to this baptism of death for the remission of our sins. The Father's voice responds to the Son's acceptance, proclaiming his entire delight in his Son. The Spirit whom Jesus possessed in fullness from his conception comes to "rest on him". Jesus will be the source of the Spirit for all mankind. At his baptism "the heavens were opened" - the heavens that Adam's sin had closed - and the waters were sanctified by the descent of Jesus and the Spirit, a prelude to the new creation. \\n\\nThrough Baptism the Christian is sacramentally assimilated to Jesus, who in his own baptism anticipates his death and resurrection. The Christian must enter into this mystery of humble self-abasement and repentance, go down into the water with Jesus in order to rise with him, be reborn of water and the Spirit so as to become the Father's beloved son in the Son and "walk in newness of life".

I think most of these people's answers are trying to judge you and think you're talking about yourself in this situation and not answering your question, I think that's funny!!!\\n\\nAnd since this is Yahoo ANSWERS I will now ANSWER THE QUESTION POSTED!!!

It is proper that music be one means by which the church expresses her unity. Singing is an act which unites God's people at all times in history, on heaven and earth in the common praise of God. \\n\\n "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!" Psalm 133:1 \\nSinging is to be an outward manifestation of ones faith and joy. It is in response to God's saving work and finds expression not in unhindered self-expression, but in humble, disciplined participation in the Body of Christ. \\nBy singing, we are reminded (and remind others) of the reality of the Church's unity in Christ, her presence on heaven and earth, of our individual contribution as a member of the Body, and, preeminently, of our great God who is the subject of our praise.

Before we invaded Iraq,we had the support of the entire world. Nobody objected to our going after the Taliban in Afghanistan and we had a coalition of allies who were willing to support our cause.  Bush,Pearle,Rumsfeld,Wolfowitz,Cheney and Rice squandered that good will by deliberately lying to the American people and the world about phoney WMD's. They also told us that the war would pay for itself with Iraqi oil. Unfortunately what Bush has accomplished is something no one in history has been able to do,he has turned the entire Islamic world into our enemy. Instead of them hating the Jews in Israel they now hate us. This war will never be won by our troops because when you have people willing to blow their selves up for a cause any victory will only come when the last suicide bomber has died. The Middle east would have been a far more stable region had we not invaded and killed hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians including women and children.
The MIDI mapper in Microsoft Windows allows you to customize Windows to work with your particular MIDI hardware and software. It functions much like the Windows printer and video drivers -- once they are correctly configured, you can use any Windows program with these devices.\\n\\nI'm sure you already know that Midis are music files. A MIDI file is a data file. It stores information, just like a text (ie, ASCII) file may store the text of a story or newspaper article, but a MIDI file contains musical information. Specifically, a MIDI file stores MIDI data -- the data (ie, commands) that musical instruments transmit between each other to control such things as playing notes and adjusting an instrument's sound in various ways. \\n\\n\\n\\nhttp://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/midi/html/midi_mapper.html\\n\\nsetting it up\\nhttp://www.sseyo.com/products/koanpro/html/koan_Setting_Up_the_MIDI_M.htm

No question about it, I would choose flying.

Cool for awhile I suppose, but nothing in comparison (I think!) to the 'hurl and the gliding' of flight.

I think that the universe is divine. That the expanding and contracting correspond to the Hindu view of the great cycle of Brahman breathing in and out. We begin at the starting point, evolve until we return to that same point. So what you've described above, that united existence, is pretty much the way it is regardless. (And before someone jumps on this and says they, aka scientists, no longer believe in a contracting universe ... That was before they discovered that each galaxy has a black hole at its center that draws everything in on itself. Once the galaxies have folded in upon themselves they will begin to draw each other until ... Contraction. Funny how contractions always come before birth. lol )

Being "Black Listed" isn't a formal list.  It refers to a bad reputation that makes someone a less than desirable employee, making it hard for them to get employed.\\n\\nThe most famous was the Communist witch hunt.  In this instance, it was created by the government.  Many intellectuals, actors, writers, etc. found themselves unable to get employment because the refused to take part in the witch hunt.  Government agencies threatened harassment if any employer hired these people.\\n\\nThe government has also made these "Virtual black lists" for other reasons.  Howard Stern could claim this.  In early days, many comedians found themselves in this situation because their routines were considered too racy.\\n\\nSome scientists have also claimed government harassment because they spoke out against the governemnt policies or left government employment.\\n\\nSocial institutions can also create a virtual black list.  In these instances, they typically try to use economic pressure to prevent employment of individuals.  \\n\\nA person can be black listed if they gain a bad reputation in their industry.  For example, if an engineer or architect designed a bridge, building, or other structure that failed, they might not be able to get employment in their industry, even if they are cleared later.\\n\\nA person can also be "Black listed" for famous behavior or notoriety shunned by society.  For example, if someone was accused of a well publicized crime and later found innocent, the reputation of the accusation could follow them making employment difficult.\\n\\nIf a person has had a lot of difficulties at several employers, they can find themselves black listed as their bad reputation follows them from 1 employer to the next.\\n\\nYou can also find yourself black listed in a company because of a well known goof up or just because a higher level manager doesn't like you.  This can effect pay raises, how you are treated, and your general level of happiness in a company.\\n\\nIn summary, to be effective, black listing requires at least 1 of the following:\\n-Government involvement\\nInvolvement by a social institution (such as religion)\\n-Well publicized notariety\\n-A small community (a small town)\\n-A small industry with few employers

We have so many of their illegal aliens inside our own borders, what would really be the difference? We could take all of that $$ and energy that we put toward "border control" and put it to use somewhere else-like the real war we are fighting in Iraq. Anyway, yes we should allow it. We should own Mexico, we practically do anyway-they are in debt up to their ears with us. And we are paying for their illegal citizens to come live in our country. We are paying double! It would save time and money if we just encompassed them into us. We're both bilingual countries anyway. I don't see that it would make that much of a difference to us. To Mexico it would.

Hey, we are. We've lost are grip on the english language, our students are failing, and the law of entropy is firmly in place.
Using Australia:\\n\\nUnder s51 of the Australian Constitution, the Federal Parliament is give a list of powers in which they can pass law or amend laws over, known as exclusive. Other powers not listed there belong solely to the states, and are known as residual powers (s52). Sometimes, there are powers which overlap, and they are shared (Concurrent Powers), with Federal law prevailing over state when a conflict occurs between the two laws (s109). \\n\\nThe powers which Federal has are those which deals with money, external affairs, and other subjects which the whole of Australia is affected. The State powers are those "closer to home," such as health or education, which can differ from state to state. \\n\\nOtherwise, both Parliaments exercise the same power (or close to), with both Parlt having two houses (Queensland Parliament has only one house) and can pass law anytime Parliament is sitting.

Hi Red Rock\\n\\nHere are some ideas on how to heal the issue.\\n\\nCauses\\nWarts are caused by any of 35 viruses and are often a consequence of poor diet and nutrition, poor hygiene, and, in the cases of genital warts, unprotected sex. Warts also become more common as a consequence of aging with corresponding diminished immune function.\\n\\nCaution: Some warts can turn into cancerous tumors. If they do not seem benign, consult with a physician immediately.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------...\\n\\nNatural Cures\\n\\nNote: Natural healing of warts may require one to two months of care, with the wart disappearing suddenly in one to three days.\\n\\nAromatherapy: Lemon essential oil applied topically can speed healing. Thuja oil is also effective for dealing with warts.\\n\\nDiet: Eat an organic, whole foods diet, emphasizing foods that are high in vitamin A, such as dark green and yellow vegetables, cold-water fish, eggs, and sulfur, such as onions, garlic, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and broccoli. Avoid all refined and processed foods, sugar, unhealthy fats, and excess animal proteins, as well as milk and dairy products.\\n\\nHerbs: a.Onions for Warts: Warts have been said to disappear when treated perseveringly with raw onion dipped in salt. \\n\\nb.Wild Lettuce for Warts: The expressed juice is "much regarded as an application to boils, abscesses and carbuncles, and if put upon warts will cause them to drop off. \\n\\nc.Garlic for Warts and Moles: Here is a very successful routine for removal of these unwanted growths called moles, or warts. Take a button of garlic, slice or cut in two, and placed the cup area over a wart of mole. Tape it on, and as it dries out put a fresh piece. Many users have reported good results. \\n\\nd.Cashew Oil: The cashew oil, which must be used with great caution, is used as an application to warts, corns, ringworms, cancerous ulcers. \\n\\nd.Potassium Deficiency for Warts and Moles: When cysts or tumors grow in places where they can be seen outside the body, often we react by having them cut out. This defeats healing by working on the effect instead of the cause. You can cut cysts out, tumors off, and burn warts off (which are also a potassium deficiency), or get rid of as many moles as you wish, but unless you go to the cause, they will grow back again, and you may end up with as many or more cysts, tumors, moles as before. Different signs of potassium deficiency will keep popping out on the body because the condition that needs correcting is on the inside. You have to go into the cause, Dr. Christopher always insisted, which is the way we have been eating.Potassium sources: There are several ways to receive your potassium. Dr. Bernard Jensen sells a potassium broth made from dehydrated vegetables. Dr. Bronner makes a similar, excellent product. You can also make your own potassium broth by simmering equal parts of red potatoes, celery, carrots, onions, and herbs to taste. Raw vegetable and fruit juices also flood the system with potassium. \\n\\nBest of health to you

I'm not sure how you've got your Firefox set up. It may be just the default settings we're dealing with here, or it might even be the result of a funky extension causing some issues. Either way, though, I'm going to tell you how I've got my browser set up to handle links that open in a new window (e.g. pop-ups). Of course it's first important to distinguish that these pop-ups you describe are the good pop-ups. I mean you probably still want Firefox to block the JavaScript pop-ups from showing. No problem, however, because my method won't bother those settings! So, deep breath. Here we go.\\n\\nFirst, read up on editing your user.js file at [1]. Next, download and place the following file from [2] in your profile folder. Make sure Firefox is closed when doing this. Now, open FF again.\\n\\nLastly, go to Tools -> Options and then select the Tabs panel. You should be able to see a setting that says "Force links that open new windows to open in:". Make sure the option is set to "a new tab" and you're reading to roll.\\n\\nSo, let us know how you get on. Good luck.

No one is keeping track of your income. Even if it was correctly reported by your employers to the IRS, the IRS won't have this information at hand for several months, and by that time they will be more than willing to charge you interest and penalties if you have not paid taxes on that income.

You assume responsibility for the sin of someone else.  You, a sinner, insist upon paying the price for another person's sin, which is not Christ like.  A sinner cannot save another sinner.  There is no salvation in this poem for you or the suicide victim.  Structurally it is good, though.  It does express an idea that most people are oppressed by, that the failures of others are somehow their fault.

God. (cheating) This explanation is what everyone eventually resorts to when the other answers fail. Now, before I go any further, I should make clear that I'm not talking about any of the gods defined in various religions. Throughout all of human history, we've been trying to explain existence. But nobody has ever succeeded. And it's likely that nobody ever will. So we create the concept of God, whose only necessary property is being "that which explains existence." \\n\\nThis doesn't tell us much about god, though. It doesn't mean that any particular religion is correct. It merely defines god as something which answers The Question, because we have not been able to.
The word "latent" means "hidden". Latent energy is the energy required for a substance to change its state. Consider water boiling. The temperature will be constant at 100 degrees Celsius; it will not increase even though energy is being absorbed by the water. This energy is latent energy. It is being used to weaken the inter particle forces. Latent energy however does increase kinetic energy of particles. If it did not do so, particles would not be able to overcome the forces of attraction between them and move away from each other. Substances would not be able to change state.

I remember a game played in 1977 at Hampden between a Glasgow Select and The Football League. As you have described, the Glasgow jerseys were green and blue stripes and the team consisted of mainly Old Firm players with Kenny Dalglish as captain. Can't remember a match in 1975.
Make sure you get a copy of the check from your bank.  also proof that it was cashed.  Get a receipt or have your name added to the license.  if you want out, simply ask...... ask for your money back and to be released to pursue your own ventures.  Also ask if you are owed additional monies from profits made.  Don't be scared, its your money and your decision.
I'd like to add some things. When they give a gift, it is not wholly altruistic, they like to cancel their "debt" to you (in this case by being offered a place to stay). Also don't bother bowing to them because there are tons of different nuances to the bowing ritual that American's wouldn't understand unless they were taught it from a young age. In other words, you're bound to do it wrong. Other than that, my experience with Japanese people has always been positive. They were eager to learn English and were very kind and polite.

You could use the old school approach- use mono filament line, such as super-thin clear fishing line. Experiment with the film angles and lighting to get decent footage where the lines are not visible. That's how they did it for decades, not only in stop motion, but live action films (see just about any 1950s Grade-B sci-fi/horror/alien invasion film to see how NOT to do it, where the lines are completely visible) Digital editing is a nice idea, but it kind of does away with the whole idea of stop motion- if you can digitally manipulate the back ground, why stop there? why not just digitally manipulate all the action as well?
load your pc in safemode. When you reboot your pc continue to press F8 and it will start in safe mode then scan your pc with avast or norton to get rid of it. If that doesnt work then the only other option you have is to reformat your pc which is simple just remember to save your Favorites folder and any other folder and music you wanna keep otherwise they will be gone. Good luck Further question email me page_12001@yahoo.com
Pope Leo must have hated the Reformation and Martin Luther.  He was born a Medici and got the church way into debt.  As a result, he decided to sell 'indulgences' or forgiveness for sin.  Martin Luther called him and the church on this as well as many other things.  He was called out and had no where to hide.  That's enough reason, don't you think?

Hi,\\n\\nThe two processors use totally different CPU (processor) sockets so they are not compatible. In addition, the pinout (the input and output signals) are on different pins on the CPU. There are other reasons outside of the CPU socket and pinout such as the support chipset on the motherboard.\\n\\nThe easiest thing to do is to verify that you can not get a faster AMD CPU (if you provide more information on your motherboard - make and model #, we can see if a faster CPU will work as the cheapest solution to a new CPU and motherboard). In many cases, the problem is not the speed of the CPU (unless you are a gamer), it is the amount of memory you have, the # of processes starting up at bootup (a lot of those cute little icons in the lower right part of the screen are NOT your friends. They eat up some basic sections of memory that can cause your computer to appear bogged down.).\\n\\nGeorge

I do agree that there is a lot of disturbing, vulgar, and not very "family values" oriented stuff in the Bible. When I read the Bible it seems so obviously written by uncivilized men that I have a hard time understanding how some people still think it is the divinely inspired word of God. I think if it came out today the folks at places like Focus on Family or Concerned Women for America would be working overtime to have it banned from school libraries.

I looked at your profile where you said "lost and alone". I also looked at your questions. One was on marriage and divorce and getting your heart broken and another was about why life is so disappointing. Another question was if anyone has ever thought about murder. You seem to be suffering from depression or some other mental illness. My guess is that you took an overdose of pills to kill yourself and now you have second thoughts. If this is the case, get someone to take you to the emergency room at the closest hospital or call 911. In any case, you need to see a psychiatrist asap or at least talk with your doctor who can advise you or refer you to someone in the mental health department. Depression is nothing to be ashamed of and you should seek help. Let us hear from you. God bless.
That should come from the parents....I agree with you that kids should learn/know all of their culture.  That is a part of who they are, and they should be proud of it!

Simply put: the nervous system is an electrical system.\\n\\nMore complexly put:  the nervous system is an electro-biochemical system where electrical signals are transported down the neuron to a synapse.  At the synapse, a chemical or hormone neurotransmitter is released.  This neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the nerve downstream, and activates an electrical current which continues to propagate to it's destination.\\n\\nThe difference between a functioning nerve and a functioning wire... functionally speaking... is none.  Structurally speaking, a wire is made of a conductive metal, surrounded by an insulating sheath of rubber or plastic.  A nerve cell, or neuron, stretches out long processes, called axons, to conduct electricity through the body.  It's insultation is provided by another type of cell, called the Schwann cell.  The Schwann cell, is composed of lipids (fats) which insulate the neuronal axon.
No, I do not think that a majority of Americans go along with denying civil liberty's. This one falls directly on the Bush administration, I think that they should be tried as war criminals for this and other crimes against humanity. He has set himself up as a dictator and with a rubber stamp repuglican congress he will remain that way, that is one of the many reasons that we need to elect enough democrats this November to restore checks and balances to the government.

Well, obviously the people that have answered this are not thinking correctly and/or have never smoked marijuana in their lives.  I used to be an avid smoker and I still can't believe how naive people in this country are.  Not one person that answered mentioned alcohol and the fact that it is responible for thousandsn and thousands of deaths in this country every year.  People who smoke pot are not even close to being crackheads and whoever said that is an idiot.  I would much rather stumble upon 10 people who are stoned while walking down the street thatn 10 people who are drunk.  The latter of the above statements usually results into some kind of fight or people pissing all over the place or destroying something.  If you are going to be that person who is against the use of marijuana but condones the use or uses alcohol, needs to take a closer look at themselves.  Alcohol impairs your decision making a great deal, hence the amount of people who drive drunk.  When was the last time you heard of a peron who was stoned getting into a major accident and killing people?  I have yet to hear that story.  All legalizing pot would do is cut down on the amount of drug dealers that there are in this country.  If pot was legal, I would grow my own, and I'm sure that most people would.  Stop listening to things that people made up in the 60's and start living in the present.  Alcohol is bad and should be illegal.  Did you ever think of that?

All i can suggest is as long as it is to be a long distance relationship, write her an email every day...... no more than one, unless she responds.... telling her how your day went, how much you miss her, what you miss about her........ it will help. Then find some guys, and go play basketball, or video games....... anything to take your mind off her. OTherwise, talk to her, see how she feels about you...... make sure your both on the same page, for if she is trying to push away, now would be the time to make the break, no matter how painful! good luck!
The median profits per partner figure at America's 100 top-grossing law firms in 2003 was $792,500, up almost 9.3 percent from 2002. The average was even more astonishing: $930,700, up about 10 percent. Ten years ago, million-dollar partner paydays were limited to two or three firms. No more. Thirty-two of the firms on this year's chart enjoyed average profits per partner of $1 million or more, and they aren't just the usual New York and Los Angeles suspects. Bingham McCutchen, Dechert, and Howrey Simon Arnold & White were all over $1 million for the first time, each with profitability jumps of 14 percent or more. Partnership was very, very good to a lot of big-firm lawyers in 2003. \\n-- taken from the article referenced below.\\n\\nNote that these are averages for partners, generally, at these firms, not managing partners, who tend to make at the top of the scale.

There are several characters that distinguish members of the Order Primates from other mammals, but different members of the Order may or may not display all of these characteristics as they have evolved in different directions throughout their evolutionary history:\\n\\n1.  opposable thumb and big toe (opposable thumb is best developed in humans.  thumb is completely lost in spider monkeys)\\n\\n2.  flat nails instead of claws  (marmosets have re-developed claws to assist in climbing)\\n\\n3.  hindlimb-dominated locomotion (best developed in humans and sifakas, forelimbs have become dominant in gibbons)\\n\\n4.  relative reduction in the olfactory sensory system as compared to other mammalian orders (very noticeable in South American primates, snouts have become enlarged again in the baboons, are still well developed in many lemur species)\\n\\n5.  increased reliance on visual sensation (primates in general probably have the best vision and best colour sensation of any group of mammals)\\n\\n6.  tendency towards smaller litter size, longer gestation times and extended juvenile growth with accompanied increase in material care (most developed in humans with 18+ years of parental care and litter sizes of even two being unusual)\\n\\n7.  relatively large brains (again, most developed in humans)\\n\\n8.  reduced number of teeth, with a maximum of two incisors, one canine, three premolars and three molars in each jaw quadrant (humans have further reduced this to two premolars, and the third molars (aka wisdom teeth) often do not develop at all)\\n\\nSo there is no one trait that automatically designates a mammal as being a primate.

Start here:
No, you do not need to be certified. From my experience in starting my consulting firm, everyone claims to be an expert, but they don't know what they are talking about. In about 6 months, you will know more than all of the books put together. So don't sweat it. It just is not that important.\\n\\nNo, you do not need a business plan. Whoever told you that you needed one is wrong. Business plans are primarily used to get financing from a bank, which you are not going to get for a service business. Since this is only going to be a micro busniess venture, you will spend more time updating your spreadsheets than using the plan. Since you plan on transitioning from a full-time job to this, you are set financially. Don't let this bogus requirement get you down.\\n\\nYou do need a marketing plan. For your business, I would strongly recommend Guerilla Marketing by Jay Conrad Levinson. Pick a few marketing techniques that you are comfortable with and go at it. Just off the top of my head, I would have business cards, web site, stationery, flyers, and attend networking events. Your potential clients should include salesman (notoriously disorganized), real estate agents, insurance agents, independent consultants, and executives who want an assistant but their company won't let them hire one directly. You want to be marketing regularly. Again, GM by Levinson is perfect for you.\\n\\nIf I was looking for a virtual assistant, I would only be interested in references and a client list. Having stated that, your first priority should be to define what exactly you are willing to do? Payroll, travel arrangements, online research, telemarketing, etc.  Once you have an idea of what you will do, I would make up a cost sheet and a list of references. Since you do not have any clients, use personal references. The only other question I have that your clients would share is how well are you going to help me when you have a full-time job.\\n\\nAlthough I do not use VA's, I know small business owners that swear by them. I also know that there were times when I was stuck in an airport that I would have loved having someone to call  who could get me the hell out of there or arrange a hotel or something.  \\n\\nBest of luck to you.

First off, don't even think about sex unless you're both gonna be in a relationship. If he's a virgin, you should cherish that and and really to connect with him emotionally and spiritually and not only will the sex be OUTSTANDING but your relationship will last. When the talk of sex comes up between you just make sure he's ready and discuss protection and because you're more experienced try not to scare him with advanced techniques ;) if you know what I mean! Just be true to yourself and make sure he does the same because the worst feeling in the world is to regret your first time and have bad feelings towards the person who took your virginity, trust me, I'm speaking from experience!! Have fun!

In plants, the light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts and use light energy to synthesize ATP and NADPH. The photons are captured in the antenna complexes of photosystem I and II by chlorophyll and accessory pigments (see diagram at right). When a chorophyll a molecule at a photosystem's reaction center absorbs energy, an electron is excited and transferred to an electron-acceptor molecule through a process called Photoinduced charge separation. These electrons are shuttled through an electron transport chain that initially functions to generate a chemiosmotic potential across the membrane, the so called Z-scheme shown in the diagram. An ATP synthase enzyme uses the chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during photophosphorylation while NADPH is a product of the terminal redox reaction in the Z-scheme.\\n\\n[edit]\\nWater photolysis\\nThe NADPH is the main reducing agent in chloroplasts, providing a source of energetic electrons to other reactions. Its production leaves chlorophyll with a deficit of electrons (oxidized), which must be obtained from some other reducing agent. The excited electrons lost from chlorophyll in photosystem I are replaced from the electron transport chain by plastocyanin. However, since photosystem II includes the first steps of the Z-scheme, an external source of electrons is required to reduce its oxidized chlorophyll a molecules. This role is played by water during a reaction known as photolysis and results in water being split to give electrons, oxygen and hydrogen ions. Photosystem II is the only known biological enzyme that carries out this oxidation of water. Initially, the hydrogen ions from photolysis contribute to the chemiosmotic potential but eventually they combine with the hydrogen carrier molecule NADP+ to form NADPH. Oxygen is a waste product of light-independent reaction, but oxygen is used in cellular respiration for a majority of organism on earth

It does depend a little on how young we are talking about - a 5 year old is not going to understand some of the more sublte triggers and points that perhaps a 14 year old might\\n\\nIf you are a victim to racism, then unless you want the youngster to "be a victim" try and make them realise that there will ALWAYS be people who have a problem with someones colour , religion, gender, sexuality etc and race is no different. Try to make them realise it is nothing to do with them, more a hangup belongin to someone else.\\n\\nIf you hear them making slurs and are racist, then presumably you would be impressed. Sad but there ya go. If you are not overly impressed, then rather than jump down their throats, try to find out what made them make the comments, see if you can get them to explain their attitude. Do they have a reason - is it peer pressure ?\\n\\nIf you don't approve of racism, then above applies really, try and deal with it with them in a realistic and honest way - but do not add your own personal thoughts grudges and hang-ups to the pot if you can help it.\\n\\nIf you are racist, then I guess you will encourage your child to carry on the hate for another generation. Seems a bit of a cruel thing to do but there ya go.\\n\\n\\nps:\\n\\nMizogen, your story about the Jewish father is powerful and I have heard it before. But although very quotable, I think there is a danger f being too cynical in life.\\n\\nI would far rather be taken for a mug once in a blue-moon  - and accept that some folks are decent human beings - than make sure I distrust everyone at all time no matter what.\\n\\nTelling a child he should epxect no good from any man is a pretty good way of crippling his/her social skills from day one. My guess is that if you follow your own advice, you are perhaps someone who "enjoys their own company" a great deal of the time. do you really wish such a friendless, loveless life for your kids too?

I used to have this same setup on my server.  I used a free CGI script called Profile Manager Basic (version 3.0).  When a family member wanted to sign in, I simply gave them a username and password that was the same for everyone related.  They would go to the sign in page, where the .htaccess file would grant them permissions to enter and add their contact information as well as see all other family members contact info.  Very good and extremely simple to implement.  As for the server may I suggest a few things?  First is the Abyss Server a free one from Aprelium Technolgies. http://www.aprelium.com/abyssws  Next is to visit http://www.no-ip.com and set up a free port forwarding account.  Combined you can see the results below on my site.  Vary easy to maintain connection, and extremely reliable.  You do realize that you need to have DSL or a cable connection for this all to work, right?  Good luck, and I hope this helps

I agree with you 100%.  But dollhaus is correct about SUV's - I remember learning it that way in the 1980s.  Also for numbers - 80's and 90's, as well as 80s and 90s, have both been considered correct at one time or another.  But what really irritates me the most are the apostrophe's used for plural's.  That just looks incredibly ignorant!  It gets confusing, too, when people use them for their plurals but not their possessives.  The boy's played with the dogs toy's today.  This book is hers'.  I knew someone who did this a lot.  I just hate reading things like that, because I usually end up having to read it a couple of times to make sure I understood it correctly.  \\n\\nI had a manager one time who completely understood - he compared it to someone who was musically inclined hearing a note that was out of tune.  A grammatical error stands out to some people the way a sour note stands out to others.  I am definitely one of the former.  Not to say that I don't make errors myself, but I try to correct them as I go.  A lot of people just don't care to make the effort.\\n\\nAnother thing that really irritated me - on one of my son's computer games, it uses it's instead of its.  These games are supposed to be designed to teach children, not promote ignorance!

First things first, don't be dieting unless you are obese. If you're just overweight, it is a very bad time in your life to be doing that to your growing body.\\n\\nSecond, since you're 14, you're probably a freshman. I have to say, you really don't need to be going out with guys right now. Not only is it just too young, but guys are really not finding themselves yet, and until guys find themselves, they won't be able to see the beautiful, true you. I hate how it works, but I also strongly dislike shallow people and avoid them.\\n\\nSo basically, it is unlikely that there are many guys your age who can actually see behind the mask, which I know is a travesty but it's just what media does to us.\\n\\nPlus, having a boyfriend at this age, although is scattered with good times, is wrought with bad times and hurt feelings. Just wait for a little while, and when the right guy comes along you'll know.\\n\\nBest of luck to you!
Since  a mature erythrocyte does not contain a nucleus (not a typical eukaryotic cell) , it is commonly referred to as a corpuscle.\\nIn sickle cell anemia the cell takes on a sickle shape, does not carry a sufficient amount of oxygen, and may even clog up arterioles and capillaries. This is an inherited disease , more common with black people of African decent. The individual may be a "carrier" in the heterozygous condition, suffering ill effects during exertion or at high altitudes. The full blown disease occurs in the homozygous recessive condition.\\nA similar disease, "Coolies anemia" (spelling?) is prevalent among people decending from the Mediterranian area.

The Bermuda Triangle is Bullsiht.  To quote the Skeptic's Dictionary:\\n\\n"There are some skeptics who argue that the facts do not support the legend, that there is no mystery to be solved, and nothing that needs explaining.The number of wrecks in this area is not extraordinary, given its size, location and the amount of traffic it receives. Many of the ships and planes that have been identified as having disappeared mysteriously in the Bermuda Triangle were not in the Bermuda Triangle at all. Investigations to date have not produced scientific evidence of any unusual phenomena involved in the disappearances. Thus, any explanation, including so-called scientific ones in terms of methane gas being released from the ocean floor, magnetic disturbances, etc., are not needed. The real mystery is how the Bermuda Triangle became a mystery at all."
Yes it is true that elves or dwarfs exist.  Elves don't but dwarfs do.  Congenital dwarfism is actually termed skeletal or chondrodysplasia and is literally premature closure of the growth plates or failure of the long bones to form properly.  Sometimes it is a genetic defect that interferes with bone growth, sometimes a pituitary disorder.

No. Not all animals bleed red.\\n\\nWarm-blooded animals have red blood because they have the pigment hemoglobin.   Hemoglobin is the pigment in warm-blooded animals that carries oxygen molecules from the lungs throughout the body.\\nHemoglobin is red, related to the iron atom at the center of the molecule.  \\n\\nInsect blood, for example, does not have hemoglobin, and is clear ... although it can appear green or yellow, most likely from chlorophyll from the plants it eats.  (Chlorophyll is the pigment in plants used for photosynthesis.)\\n\\nInterestingly, the chlorophyll molecule in plants is very similar to the hemoglobin.   The main difference is that chlorophyll has a magnesium atom in the center, rather than iron, and this is what makes chlorophyll green, while hemoglobin is red.

Benedict the XVI means he is the 16th Pope to take the name Benedict since the beginning of the church...it has nothing to do with the number of cardinals.\\n\\nThe College of Cardinals is like the Supreme Court, appointed by the Pope but serve for life.

No...there are almost 200 of them.\\n4.  No, all cardinals under the age of 80 will be responsible for voting in the next pope.  There are 193 Cardinals and 120 of them are under 80 right now.\\n\\nThe next Pope won't necessarily be the 17th. The last one was the second (John Paul II).  If that Pope chooses the name of Benedict, (yes, they choose their own names) then he would be the 17th.  Otherwise, he will either be John Paul III or John the 27th or Peter II, depending what he chooses.

astronomy in particular deals with very large numbers, which can be difficult to handle. using exponents(scientific notation) makes that easier.\\nfor example the average distance from the earth to the sun is 93,000,000 miles. converting to sci notation makes that number 9.3 x 10(7). The distance to the nearest star is 24 trillion miles. How much fun would it be to multiply those two numbers together? not much as real numbers but in scientific notation it is much easier.
First, to answer the question:\\n\\nGo to your Yahoo Mail account and click on ‘Options’ (to the right, near the top). Under ‘Management’ click on ‘Mail Addresses’, then select the account you are having trouble with (there is probably only one) and select ‘Edit’. Enter your full email address in the box labeled ‘Reply to:’ under ‘Name and Email’ and select ‘Save’ (at the left).\\n\\n\\nAdditional details (since my other answer):\\n\\nGlad I was able to help. You may want to leave the 'Reply to:' box blank; when someone replies to your email it will still automatically go to you (when you fill in the 'Reply to:' box all replies go to the address entered, but when it is left blank the recipient’s email handler defaults to reply to the sender), and there will be a slightly lessened chance that your emails will sometimes be mistaken for spam and accidentally blocked by some spam filters.

Not sitting too close to the televison screen was something people were worried about in the 1950s and '60s, but not so much recently. There *are* some worries about "video display terminals" (monitors), actually.\\n\\n"Virtually no one believes that under ordinary circumstances television watching poses any special danger. (Well, physically, anyway.) Prior to 1968 or so some sets emitted excessive X-rays, but that problem has now been eliminated. More recently concern has arisen about computer video display terminals (VDTs), which typically are viewed at much closer range than televisions; research is inconclusive so far but continuing. To be on the safe side some eye doctors say you shouldn't let your kids get closer than five feet to the TV screen, the room shouldn't be pitch black, etc. But the intention is to prevent eye fatigue, not eye damage."

There are MANY types of headaches...with several different origins. The most common one is the tension headache, which originates in muscle spasm in the neck and shoulder areas. Others include things like migraines, cluster headaches, and they are also a common feature in many other illnesses like the flu or other generalized infections. They may come from muscular sources, vascular sources (in the blood vessels of the head or brain), or--RARELY--from increased pressure inside the head from something like a brain tumor or fluid mechanics problem.  Most headaches are simply a nuisance, though some can truly be debilitating, and NOT related to any serious pathology.

An MCT diet, or medium chain triglyceride diet, is one form of a ketogenic diet. A ketogenic diet is one that is high in fat and extremely low in carbohydrate. It is often used to treat epilepsy, but (obviously) has other uses as well, such as in your brother's case of non-Hodgkins lymphoma.\\n\\nIt works by inducing ketosis and its related effects, a condition typically only present in starving individuals. Without getting too technical, in ketosis, the body stops using glucose as an energy source and starts using fat.\\n\\nNormally we don't want this to happen, but in the case of your brother, it could cause a reduction in chyle buildup because the body would be forced to use the chyle (which is just lymphatic fluid rich in fat and other nutrients) as an energy source.\\n\\nI have included below in the source information a page with guidelines for a few different ketogenic diets. The page is geared toward the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy, but the dietary guidelines themselves are the same (the ketogenic diet is the ketogenic diet, regardless of what you are using it for). Hope this helps, and best of luck to your brother.
Could mean a lot of different things depending on the context. It could be that the office where your company's payroll gets processed is closing temporarily, like for a holiday. Or maybe you have multiple locations where payroll is processed and they're downsizing by closing a few (but not all) of the locations. Or it could be in reference to the end of the year--- they are closing the year so you need to submit your payroll information a little earlier than usual so they can pay everyone on time and still finish out the annual bookkeeping.  Could you please give more detail about how this statement was made?
In this, I assume "our nation" is the Philippines?\\n\\nThe thing to remember is that such a drastic change in the way you are governed will have long-term effects.

With a unicameral legislature, and no nationally-elected President, a coalition of faction can rule the nation until the next election.

Domestic Violence charges do not just go away like they use to. Even though they can be dropped later by the state the arrested person still will have a criminal history that will show one charge and no conviction. The DA may decide to drop the charges when you go in front of a judge if there is a bad witness or no witness willing to testify. A wife can not be compelled to testify against her husband just because the state decides to prosecute. The spouse needs to contact the agency that is handling the case and the DA or prosecutor that is handling it for the state and I am sure something can be worked out mutually. Domestic violence is frowned upon now and carries stiff sentences so try and avoid domestic violence at all costs.

I'll tell you what.  I swear by this.\\n\\nMy girlfriend who was really heavy asked me one day to go speed walking , not jogging, with her.  She was doing this as part of a lose weight thing.  So I agreed.\\n\\nNow, I am only 120 lbs and did not need to lose weight, however doing this I LOST 7 LBS THE FIRST SIX DAYS!!!!\\n\\nAll it is , is you walk fast, seven days a week at 2miles a day in 20 minutes....you'll notice the first few days you will feel sore and simply like dying, and especially with those little muscles you didn't realize you had at the top of the feet, but continue and don't quit.\\n\\nSo, you'll notice your heartbeat is faster the few days as it gets used to the exercise, then the soreness goes away, the heartbeat lowers and after a week of this committment you should lose a lot of weight.  You can cut it down to five days, after the first month................

Winning the champions league is more important cos club teams can have the best players in each country. Country teams are restricted to players their own nationality and they may not have as good players in their side, so that makes the champions league harder to win.

Okay, if you are a historical person that likes a ton of research and history, than you could write about a character going through a war.\\n\\nEx.\\nEmily Turner going through the Revolutionary War as a Loyalist to King George.  She is about to be married off to a Patriot named Stephen, but has a lover on the side who is siding with King George, and she runs off with him.  You could tell the story in 1st or 3rd person point of view.  Just make sure you don't go into anyone making love.\\n\\nAn example if you wanted to do, like the Holocaust:\\n Anne, 15, as a Jewish girl-not Anne Frank- trying to run away from the Nazi soldiers, while her family is fleeing to Sweden.  Her father gets captured as they get close enough to Sweden, and she screams for him with her 3 little sisters and 2 older brothers.  Talking about her journey to get to Sweden.  Whether she makes it or not is your decision, along with her mother and siblings.\\n\\nIf you are a mystery type of person than you could talk about a mystery going on.  I'm not a really good mystery thinker, so I'll just make up a few fake ones.\\nEx.\\n Detective Hans, 42, is going to a murder mystery and he spots that there are blood stains on a carpet square, but the person who was murdered didn't shed any blood and was certain that the blood was from a murderer, even though the police thought that it was suicide.\\n\\nIf your a nowatimes writer.  Like you want to write about situations that are going on right now.\\nEx.\\n Faith and Hope, 7, lost their mother and father in the Iraqi war, and are in an orphanage after their beloved Aunt Diana dies from the Avien flu.  You could talk about their journey to get through this and how they are looked at by the families that wish to adopt them.  I think this would be more of a 3rd POV story.\\n\\nI'll give you one last genre with ideas.  Science-Fiction/Fantasy.  This is really my forte for genre.\\n\\nEx.\\n Alise is in the year 2052 and all the oil is gone.  She must save America before the world goes into crisis mode about how much gas is a problem, because she is the one who is in charge of finding a gas substitute.(Yes, I know some gas substitutes already exist, but pretend like it never happened.) China has already become wanting to go to war with the United States, after the Communist powers had spread and engulfed Mongolia, Russia, and parts of South Asia.  This is a 1st POV\\nThis might be a little too fantasy, but:\\n Mala, 13, is a mage in the world of Kambro.  There has been an uprising of mages on one side of the world, in Kandribar, but she lives in Kaliz.  The king of Kaliz is trying to kill all of the mages, even though he knows that they are the best part of Kambro, so the second that Mala hears that guards are coming for her family, but that she can't save the whole family, she gets her brother, her female 4th cousin, her best friend, who is a mage, and herself out and into hiding with all of the mage stuff that they can take.\\n (That was just the 1st part)Now in Kambro, there is a bit of a problem.  Some foreingers from other worlds have come and are trying to kill all of Kambro, or enslave them.  It is now up to the hiding family to get their act together.  They are now in their mid-20s.  This could be a varying 1st POV story. You get to decide whether they save Kambro or not, or if you want to finish the story in the first part than just do it whether they escape or not.

If ur pregnant you shouldnt be having stomach pains that hurt really bad. when you are pregnant you get these mild cramps that are like menstral cramps, they come and go instead of being constant, and not so sharp. Although you do get discharge while you are in the first trimester, its like raw egg white. its clear, slimy and there everytime you wipe. usually there from the first week of a missed period till about 3 weeks after. by then u know ur pregnant. You should consider taking a test if you really think you are. get a good one. EPT is the best one there is. each test picks up different levels of HCG. the further along u are the more HCG there will be in your urine. If nothing ever comes of the test I would see a doctor soon because something is not right especially with the back pain and stomach pains. I have heard of some STD's giving the same symptoms. Make sure you talk to ur partner about this. this is all about ur life and his, from raising a child or an STD no matter how you look at it. hope things  go ok. good luck
Iran is FULL of oil, so really you dont need nuclear energy, you want to have a bomb, your president has publically stated that he will use the bomb on israel (if not other nations too) as soon as he gets it.. thats a first use policy. And yes hiroshima/nakaski was bombed but it was a different case, it really was not known how bad the results would be, and the usa was in a war with japan (remeber that japan started) and by dropping the bomb, MILLIONS of usa lives were saved by not having to go into japan... droping the bomb then, and iran threatening to nuke israel are completely differnt things. perhaps you should really ask why iran hates israel so much, that it would kill millions of people inlcuding jews, muslims and christians!!!

Crest whitestrips worked for me.  I did notice increased sensitivity to cold foods during the whitening process.  But my teeth weren't very sensitive before, so I didn't find it too uncomfortable.

The Seattle School Board\\n\\n\\nThe Seattle School Board is considering bringing student bus service in-house — an additional $6 million annual expense that would bring driver salaries and benefits in line with surrounding districts'.\\n\\nThe board's Operations Committee will consider the proposal this afternoon.\\n\\nThe district has been contracting for bus service since the 1970s, so providing it would mean starting from scratch: hiring about 400 drivers, buying buses and leasing land for a bus barn. A district study said it would cost an additional $62.9 million over the next 10 years, raising the cost over the decade to $148.9 million from $86 million.\\n\\nSupporters of the idea say it would improve working conditions and benefits for drivers, which in turn could lower driver turnover and improve services for students.\\n\\nBut opponents say this isn't the time to devote more money to transportation. The district has been struggling for months to save $2.5 million a year by closing seven schools.\\n\\n"I've been opposed to it from the outset," said board member Michael DeBell, who serves on the Operations Committee along with members Mary Bass and Irene Stewart. "Obviously, we're not in a position to spend significantly more money on our busing, our transportation costs. ... I believe that it's in the best interest of the district to save money wherever possible outside of classroom instruction."\\n\\nMost surrounding school districts provide their own bus service. Seattle contracts with Laidlaw Transportation Services and First Student.\\n\\nDistrict buses?\\n\\n\\nThe Seattle School Board Operations Committee will discuss bus-service options at its meeting from 4 to 6 p.m. today at school-district headquarters, 2445 Third Ave. S. In addition to discussing the contracts with Laidlaw Transportation Services and First Student, the committee will hear a report on a pilot program that placed Ballard and Franklin high-school students on Metro buses this school year. The School Board has discussed for several years bringing yellow-bus service in-house. In 2005, three board members — Stewart, Bass and Sally Soriano — voted against the current bus contract because of concerns over wages and benefits for the 400 drivers involved. That contract expires in June. Laidlaw employs about 80 of the district's drivers, and First Student employs the remainder.\\n\\nSoriano said the Portland School District decreased its driver turnover to single digits by switching from contracted bus service to directly hired drivers to transport its special-education students. It's the responsibility of the board to try to improve the stability of the district's work force, she said.\\n\\n"The overarching issue is that the board has tried to get the drivers to have it be a stable work environment," she said.\\n\\nStewart and Bass, who chairs the Operations Committee, did not return calls seeking comment.\\n\\nLaidlaw drivers voted to join the Teamsters in May. Since then, they've been in contract negotiations. First Student drivers are not organized, though Teamsters Local 174 business agent Chuck Deaver said there's an effort under way.\\n\\nLaidlaw drivers are treated "very well," said Betty Zaloudek-Moore, the Seattle branch manager. "I think this is a very positive work environment. Our drivers work very hard."\\n\\nThe committee also will consider providing district-operated transportation for its special-education students. That would cost about $12 million over 10 years.\\n\\n"I think the idea of in-housing the transportation goes beyond the treatment of the drivers," said Robert Augustin, a Laidlaw driver who has been driving Seattle district buses for eight years and supports the proposal. "From the board standpoint, they think they can save some money in the long run."\\n\\nIf the district employed bus drivers directly, driver salaries would increase about 3

Before explaining what is Human Poverty Index, let me define what Human Development Index is. The HDI – human development index – is a summary composite index that measures a country's average achievements in three basic aspects of human development: longevity, knowledge, and a decent standard of living. Longevity is measured by life expectancy at birth; knowledge is measured by a combination of the adult literacy rate and the combined primary, secondary, and tertiary gross enrolment ratio; and standard of living by GDP per capita.\\n Poverty has traditionally been measured as a lack of income - but this is far too narrow a definition. Human poverty is a concept that captures the many dimensions of poverty that exist in both poor and rich countries—it is the denial of choices and opportunities for living a life one has reason to value. The HPI-1 – human poverty index for developing countries – measures human deprivations in the same three aspects of human development as the HDI (longevity, knowledge and a decent standard of living). HPI-2 – human poverty index for selected high-income OECD countries – includes, in addition to the three dimensions in HPI-1, social exclusion.\\n\\nFor HPI-1 (developing countries): deprivations in longevity are measured by the probability at birth of not surviving to age 40; deprivations in knowledge are measured by the percentage of adults who are illiterate; deprivations in a decent standard of living are measured by two variables: the percentage of people not having sustainable access to an improved water source and the percentage of children below the age of five who are underweight.\\n\\nFor HPI-2 (selected high-income OECD countries): deprivations in longevity are measured by the probability at birth of not surviving to age 60; deprivations in knowledge are measured by the percentage of adults lacking functional literacy skills; deprivations in a decent standard of living are measured by the percentage of people living below the income poverty line, set at 50% of the adjusted median household disposable income; and social exclusion is measured by the rate of long-term (12 months or more) unemployment of the labour force.

It is part of the duty of citizenship to communicate with our elected officials to give them our opinion.  They may not take the advice (and they are doing for us as they consider proper) but sometimes maybe a constituent can provide information the official may need to help with a decision.  I agree the system is hurting.  The best answer for a third party (and I am interested in groups like  the Constitution Party) is to start with some local elections and build from there.  They don't have the juice to make it on the national stage yet, I fear.

I personally believe that Baptism is just an outward expression of an inward change.  Baptism is important as a symbol of your new birth through Christ and should be followed through by new believers, but I believe that if theoretically, someone died in between accepting Jesus and the baptistery, they would still go to Heaven.
Who else was there to preform the ceremony if they were the first humans?  \\nI guess someone will say "god married them" well then why do we need to get married in a religious ceremony or civil ceremony, why not just say "god married us--prove us wrong."\\nI think gay people should be able to get married. What is the big deal? I don't care about their sex lives.
people actually play that???
First distribute the 2 through\\n\\n2(x-6) = 2x - 12\\n\\nNow combine like terms\\n\\n2x + 2x - 12 = 52\\n4x - 12 = 52\\n\\nAdd 12 to both sides\\n\\n4x - 12 + 12 = 52 + 12\\n4x = 64\\n\\nDivide by 4\\n\\n(4x)/4 = 64/4\\nx = 16\\n\\nNow check the answer\\n\\n2(16) + 2[(16)-6] = 52\\n32 + 2[10] = 52\\n32 + 20 = 52\\n52 = 52

They are not.The large seeded Virginia Group peanuts are grown in Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and parts of Georgia.\\nThe major producers/exporters of peanuts are the United States, Argentina, Sudan, Senegal, and Brazil.It is also illegal under Federal Law to grow peanuts on more than one acre (4,000 m²) of land for commercial consumption. This effectively creates a peanut monopoly, as it is not economically feasible to grow peanuts on only one acre (4,000 m²) of land, while drastically increasing prices.

Just start looking for another place to live, and when you find another arrangement, let her know.  You don't have to explain it or tell her why.  I am sure that if she asks, you could tell her that the new place is better or cheaper or whatever that doesn't have to do with her.  That way she won't feel offended and you can live somewhere else.

Not sitting too close to the televison screen was something people were worried about in the 1950s and '60s, but not so much recently. There *are* some worries about "video display terminals" (monitors), actually.\\n\\n"Virtually no one believes that under ordinary circumstances television watching poses any special danger. (Well, physically, anyway.) Prior to 1968 or so some sets emitted excessive X-rays, but that problem has now been eliminated. More recently concern has arisen about computer video display terminals (VDTs), which typically are viewed at much closer range than televisions; research is inconclusive so far but continuing. To be on the safe side some eye doctors say you shouldn't let your kids get closer than five feet to the TV screen, the room shouldn't be pitch black, etc. But the intention is to prevent eye fatigue, not eye damage."

Good question. It's the sort of thing that seems so obvious -- but everyone has a different opinion about just what the correct answer is. In some parts of the world, sunrise happens when you can distinguish between a black thread and a white one - in other words, when the day begins to become light. In other places it isn't until the sun is actually on the horizon. It's pretty spectacular to watch the sun rise in the Grand Canyon -- it literally runs down the walls of the canyon, revealing things you never see at any other time of day, until it hits the bottom of the canyon. \\nThe actual definition must have to do with daylight, because if it were when we saw the sun on the horizon, that means there would never be a sunrise on a cloudy or rainy day. \\n'But that's just my opinion.

The short answer is that three blades do the job.  Even the largest wind turbines using blades nearly a football field long commonly use three blades.  Although four or five blades may work better, the additional improvement likely does not justify the added weight and cost.  Also consider that there is a "wake" behind each moving blade and depending on rotating speed and air velocity, too many blades would prevent each blade from biting clean air.  As a fan becomes larger, the circumference at the tips is also larger and perhaps larger fans can use more than three blades efficiently.  I just noticed that my window fan uses five blades and is much smaller than a ceiling fan but rotates much faster (higher air velocity) on high speed.

There is no definite answer to your question, since science has a limit to how small particles it can detect.  The basic theory in this area is that matter is just a standing wave.  A wave has no weight, but when encased in a sphere, it then has mass.  And mass requires weight.  This weight is so infinitesmally small it cannot be detected.  But these spheres, called photons, are held together with other photons making up quarks, which are held together by Glueon, which in turn makes up atoms, etc.  This is all based on the wave/particle duallity of light.

Listen to music. Take guitar lessons...you can get a cheap guitar, and they have all sorts of stuff on the internet that will help you. Write. I found that if I keep a notebook, journal so to speak, it helps ALOT. PRAY. Please, if nothing else, go see your doctor. There are medications and therapy, that will help you feel better.

Family and species - The variety of sea lions which live at Sea Lion Caves is commonly called the Northern, or Steller, sea lion. This sea lion is named after George Wilhelm Steller, an eminent German naturalist who accompanied the Russian explorer Vitus Bering in 1741 on his second Alaskan expedition. Steller was the first qualified observer to study and classify these animals.\\nThe Steller sea lion is a member of the Otariidae family, or eared seal. It is characterized by an external ear which can be closed when entering water and by hind feet or flippers that point forward. In contrast, Phocidae, or true seal, has no external ears and it's rear flippers point backward. Also belonging to the Otariidae family is the California sea lion and the Alaska fur seal.\\nThe Alaska fur seal (Callorhinus alascanus), is not found at Sea Lion Caves. The California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) is seen all along the Pacific Coast and is generally found at Sea Lion Caves from late fall to early spring. It readily adapts to captivity and is trained for circus acts.\\nThe largest of the eared seal family and the principal tenant of Sea Lion Caves is the Steller sea lion. This animal is also considered non-migratory because there is no mass movement to summer or winter grounds, although individuals or small groups may travel hundreds of miles in search of food. It is found from the central California coast, north to the Bering Sea and back south into northern Japanese waters. A recent U.S. Fish and Wildlife Survey indicates a possible total population of nearly 80,000 Steller sea lions. Most of these animals live on the offshore islands and rocks of British Columbia and Alaska. Some Stellers live along the California coast and about one thousand reside in Oregon Waters. The number of Steller sea lions in the Sea Lion Caves area varies from season to season and from year to year with the herd averaging about 200 animals.\\n\\nPhysical Characteristics - Sea Lions are mammals, or warm blooded animals which give birth, nurse their offspring, and must breathe air. Sea Lions are also pinnipeds -- literally, feather-footed -- meaning they have finlike members for propulsion. Their pelvic bone structure allows independent use of their flippers, and therefore, they can walk on their four weblike flippers which contain the same bony structure as the legs of land animals. In the water, the Steller sea lion swims by using a breast stroke and may reach a top speed of about 17 m.p.h. In contrast, other marine animals, such as the whale, depend on fishlike body action to move through the water. The true fur seal folds its front flippers and swims by the force of its trailing rear flippers.\\nYoung sea lions called pups seem to be immune to most diseases as long as they are breast fed. As they mature, pups become susceptible to internal parasites such as round worms and tape worms which are a deterrent to both growth and longevity. Population increases are also somewhat checked by adult sea lions inadvertently trampling their young and also by accidental drownings of the newly born which have not yet learned to swim.\\nDiet - Sea lions are carnivorous. Their skulls are similar to those of bears and their jaws contain sharp teeth much like those found in dogs, cats, and other flesh eaters. They feed exclusively on fish they catch themselves; their diet varying with whatever is abundant in the area. In the vicinity of Sea Lion Caves, they appear to subsist chiefly on bottom fish such as skate, small sharks, squid and various species of rock fish. Sea lions may descend in search of food to a depth of 80 to 100 fathoms, and normally remain submerged no longer then four or five minutes.\\nPossible sea lion predation on commercially valuable fish has been of some concern. Because of the animal's remote and rugged habitat, and because collecting specimens at sea is difficult, much is unknown about its diet habits. However, recent scientific studies indicate th

Typhoid fever (a.k.a. Enteric fever) is an illness caused by the bacterium Salmonella typhi. Very common worldwide, it is transmitted by ingestion of food or water contaminated with feces from an infected person. The bacteria then multiply in the blood stream of the infected person and are absorbed into the digestive tract and eliminated with the waste.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nDiagnosis is made by blood, bone marrow or stool cultures and with the Widal test (demonstration of salmonella antibodies against antigens O-somatic and H-flagellar) or, in less affluent countries with the urine diazo test. In epidemics and less wealthy countries, after excluding malaria, dysentery or pneumonia, a therapeutic trial with chloramphenicol is generally undertaken while awaiting the results of Widal test and blood cultures.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nTyphoid fever can be fatal. Antibiotics, such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin, are commonly used to treat typhoid fever in developed countries. Prompt treatment of the disease with antibiotics reduces the mortality rate to approximately 1%. Usage of Ofloxacin along with Lactobacillus acidophilus is also recommended.\\n\\nWhen untreated, typhoid fever persists for three weeks to a month. Death occurs in between 10% and 30% of untreated cases. Vaccines for typhoid fever are available and are advised for persons traveling in regions where the disease is common (especially Asia, Africa and Latin America). Typhim Vi is an intramuscular killed-bacteria vaccination and Vivotif is an oral live bacteria vaccination, both of which protect against typhoid fever. Neither vaccine is 100% effective against typhoid fever and neither protects against unrelated typhus.\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nWhile flying insects feeding on feces may occassionally transfer the bacteria to food being prepared for consumption, the disease is most commonly transmitted through poor hygiene habits and public sanitation conditions. Public education campaigns encouraging people to wash their hands after toileting and before handling food are an important component in controlling spread of the disease.\\n\\nA person may become an asymptomatic carrier of typhoid fever, suffering no symptoms, but capable of infecting others. According to the Centers for Disease Control approximately 5% of people who contract typhoid continue to carry the disease after they recover.\\n\\nThe most notorious carrier of typhoid fever, but by no means the most destructive, was Mary Mallon, also known as Typhoid Mary. In 1907 she became the first American carrier to be identified and traced. She was a cook in New York at the beginning of the 20th Century. Some believe she was the source of infection for several hundred people. She is closely associated with fifty cases and five deaths. Public health authorities told Mary to give up working as a cook or have her gall bladder removed. Mary quit her job, but returned later under a false name. She was detained and quarantined after another typhoid outbreak. She died of a stroke after 23 years in quarantine.\\n\\nAthens\\n\\nIn 430-426 B.C, a devastating plague, which some believe to have been typhoid fever, killed one third of the population of Athens, including their leader Pericles. The balance of power shifted from Athens to Sparta, ending the Golden Age of Pericles that had marked Athenian dominance in the ancient world. The cause of the plague had been unknown before a study in 2006 by Manolis Papagrigorakis of the University of Athens which detected DNA sequences similar to those of the bacterium responsible for typhoid fever. Ancient chronicler Thucydides also contracted the disease, but survived to tell about the plague.\\n\\n\\nGO TO :\\nhttp://www.geocities.com/avinash_abhyankar/history.htm
Realizing too late in my freshman year in college what a hick I actually was. It was something a little condescending and patronizing someone said about a stupid, tacky plaque hanging on my wall.  It wasn't that it turned me into a snob all at once at that moment - on the contrary, it made me really self-conscious. I think I realized how narrow my experience had been. Oddly, it made me more curious and more willing to expand my mind & broaden my taste. It helped me learn to be the guy - for better or worse - I've become.

Our everyday experience teaches us that an object must be "pushed" by a force in order to keep it moving. Otherwise, it will slow down and eventually stop. But this intuition is absolutely wrong. If an object is moving, then a force is required *to slow it down or stop it*, not to keep it moving. (Hence, "Objects in motion tend to stay in motion. Objects at rest tend to stay at rest.") In our everyday experience, it's the force of friction that tends to stop Earth-bound objects from moving forever. But for the Earth rotating on its axis, there is no force working to counteract the rotation (except the tidal effect of the Moon, but that's working very slowly), so you don't need to have any input energy to keep it spinning.

Businesses must register with the Secretary of State in your state.  At that time you will have a legally registered company (LLC or Corp, etc).  You can do this yourself, or use an attorney.  In this case you might call the entity ABC Enterprises, LLC.  If you want to conduct business using other names, you must file an assumed name (or D.B.A. doing Business as).  This is sometimes regulated by the state, but usually the county you live in.  Call you county clerks office to check on this.\\n\\nYou could then have several assumed names doing different things, all under the umberall of ABC Enterprises, LLC\\n\\nABC Shipping\\nABC Shopping\\nABC Whatever\\n\\nThis would save you money, as DBA filings are cheap vs LLC filings expensive.

I am not familiar with the gel that you speak of, however, gout is characterized by accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints caused by excess uric acid in the blood.  Uric acid is a byproduct of the breakdown of protein that is normally excreted by the kidneys into the urine.  To reduce uric acid concentrations it is necessary to support the kidneys, adrenal and immune system functions.  It is also necessary to detoxify by cleansing and drinking plenty of fluids.\\n\\nExcess alcohol, allergy-producing foods (get checked for food sensitivities by a naturopath), or strict diets can cause outbreaks of gout.  Foods rich in purines, such as wine, anchovies and animal liver can also cause gout.\\n\\nEssential oils can greatly help in the battle by supporting normal body functions.  You can try geranium, ledum, carrot seed, celery, juniper, rosemary CT cineol, Roman chamomile, lemon, Melaleuca alternifolia (also known as tea tree), nutmeg and Idaho tansy or there are some blends available that may relieve some of the symptoms called PanAway and JuvaFlex.  You can apply these to the affected area and some of them can be ingested as supplements.\\n\\nPlease assure that if you try essential oils they are therapeutic-grade.  Not all essential oils on the market are equal, some are even toxic.  If you would like further information, please contact me.

Fascinating facts about the invention of the Hula Hoop by \\nRichard P. Knerr and Arthur K. Melin in 1958. HULA-HOOP® \\n \\n  \\nYou may think that the Hula Hoop was a fad born in the 1950s, but in fact people were doing much the same thing with circular hoops made from grape vines and stiff grasses all over the ancient world. More than three thousand years ago, children in Egypt played with large hoops of dried grapevines.  The toy was propelled along the ground with a stick or swung around at the waist.\\nDuring the fourteenth century, a "hooping" craze swept England, and was as popular among adults as kids.   The records of doctors at the time attribute numerous dislocated backs and heart attacks to "hooping."  The word hula became associated with the toy in the early 1800s when British sailors visited the Hawaiian Islands and noted the similarity between "hooping" and hula dancing.  In 1957, an Australian company began making wood rings for sale in retail stores. \\n\\nThe item attracted the attention of Wham-0, a fledgling California toy manufacturer. Richard P. Knerr and Arthur K. Melin, of Wham-O, manufactured a plastic hoop in a variety of bright colors.  Knerr and Melin promoted it for months in 1958 on Southern California playgrounds where they would do demonstrations and give away hoops to get the children to learn and play. Their perseverence turned HULA HOOP into the greatest fad the country has ever seen. Twenty-five million were sold in four months! \\nThe Hula Hoop was introduced in 1958 and made the two men very rich indeed.   \\n\\nThe fad died out in the sixties, but Hula Hoops are now very much with us again thanks to the fitness craze.  What better way to grind off those unsightly bulges around the waist and hips.\\n \\nAT A GLANCE:\\nIn 1957, an Australian company began making wood rings for sale in retail stores.

All things that happened was really very bad.\\nBut I would like to appreciate the role of media for bringing it into notice.

If your bother comes during the daily urination act too, it will probably be an infection of the urethra. \\nOn the contrary, it could be a Prostate inflammation or a shorter “Frenulum” even.\\n[The prepuce is usually tethered at the bottom by the frenulum] \\nAt last, we should consider the vagina environment too, whose infection or acidity could be another cause.
Yes, I studied Buddhism for a while. However, I found the idea of trying to rise above suffering through enlightenment impractical and detrimental to growth.\\n\\nI have bounced many philosophies and religions through my mind and heart. Catholicism is my home. There I see the utter joy that suffering brings because it causes growth and redemption. Furthermore, the middle path as Buddha described it leaves one struggling to fight the river when really one should embrace the current and follow its flow. God asks us for extraordinary things from our life. To do great deeds and love big. Middle of the road is pleasure for one's self only.
Fascism is militaristic and nationalistic. In a Fascist government, there are no elections. Any major threats to the Fascist party are expelled from the country, killed, or otherwise silenced.\\n\\nIf the President bans elections and has the Democrats shot, we're living in Fascism. Until them, we're still a Republic.

The largest river in the state of Florida is the St. Johns River which is 310 miles or 500 kilometers long.  It is the longest river in the United States that flows north instead of south.  It is also considered on of the laziest rivers in the world since there is only a 30 foot elevation change from Indian River County to the Atlantic Ocean.  It is not uncommon to find dolphins and manatees swimming the waters of this great lake.\\n\\nFor a good bit more info this river click on the site below.

i have not read his book, but i'm sure pretty sure that most anything you want to know about real estate can be found on the internet.\\n\\nsome things to consider...\\n\\n--if you had a fool-proof way to make tons of money, would you tell everyone or would you keep it to yourself so you can make more money?\\n\\n--sheets makes most of his money from selling books and cds, not selling real estate.\\n\\n--even if you get 100% financing, there is still earnest money, home owners insurance, home inspection fee, taxes, closing costs...\\n\\n--there really aren't too many "secrets" to flipping houses.\\nthe traditional way is to buy low, spend money for minimal repairs, resell it for more money.  sometimes you'll see these signs saying they "buy ugly houses and offer cash".  they're looking for a house where someone can no longer make the payments but have some equity in it.\\n\\nthe bottomline is yes you can make money doing this, but you don't need to buy his stuff.  do your own research.  know your credit, different types of mortgages, and talk to a realtor about your goals.
Without a doubt, my freshman year History teacher.  To start, he had more DUI's than anyone I know.  He was/is an alcoholic who took out his anger on the girls in the class - and it was always the girls.\\n\\nWe did a unit on slavery and for a full two weeks he informed the class that all the girls were slaves and that the boys could treat the girls horribly during class for that entire two week period.

i believe angels exist.  i also believe they have free will.  In Isaiah the prophet says that the greatest of the angels was Lucifer and he aspired to God's throne.  He said he would make himself like the Almighty.  OK, this is open rebellion.  and a third of the angels in heaven followed him!  you've got to wonder what the problem was with a third of the angels that they would rather follow Lucifer than the Lord.  And it says that war was in Heaven and Lucifer and the angels that followed him were cast out of Heaven.\\n\\nSounds like a lot of free will to me.
I had the same problem sometimes too.\\n\\nNow I drink at least five glasses of water a day to stay hydrated (but don't drink a lot just before running though).\\n\\nAlso, I eat at least one banana every day (usually in the morning with breakfast).  Bananas contain lots of potassium, which helps prevent cramps.\\n\\nAlso, do a full-body stretch (not just your legs) before -- and after -- running.  Besides stretching your legs, also stretch your arms, shoulders, back, and obliques (sides).  \\n\\nTo stretch the obliques, clasp your fingers together and then put them above your head, with your palms facing up.  Then dip your left shoulder down to stretch your right obliques.  Dip your right shoulder down to stretch the left obliques.

The programmer is still working on his/her/its program! lol\\n\\nOur society could be the sewer of another greater society above us!, to paraphrase Futurama's sewer mutants.
There appears to be a lot of tribes...and it would help if the exact time in the 1600's were given. Apparently the earliest records of the area claim that Ontario was mainly occupied by the Algonquian and Iroquoian nations (indian tribes). However the first European to get there was Jacques Cartier and he made his way up the St. Lawrence river and met what he called the "St. Lawrence Iroquoians" at Quebec City in 1535. Now obviously I realize that you asked for explorers in the 1600's so the next person would then be Samuel de Champlain who visited the same area in 1603, however the tribes that Jacques saw were gone. According to my research, that area during the late 1500's and throughout most of the 1600's had gone through several different (tribal) wars as well as "European vs. tribe" wars. The St. Lawrence river then became what is referred to as "no man's land" until the Iroquois came out victorious in battle. Another European finally visted the same stretch of land that the two previous explorers visited and there, met up with the Iroquois nation. However this was in 1673 and the time might be a little to late for your question. \\n\\nRegardless my best guess would be the Iroquois nation; seeing as how the "St. Lawrence Iroquoians" were halfly influenced by the Iroquois nation (the other half being the Huron nation) plus the phrase sounds more like a nickname than anything else. Hope I helped. \\nQuestions about the issue: CanDo417@e-garfield.com

This colorful term for a wild spree, especially one involving much drinking, probably originated on the frontier. In the nineteenth century the section of town where brothels and saloons were located was known as the 'red light district.' So a group of lusty cowhands out for a night 'on the town' might very well take it into their heads to make the whole town red.

This life is a probabtionary state to see if we will be faithful and obedient to God, not only in the good times but in the difficult times as well. There must be opposition in all things or we would not progress. It is sometimes said that we will be put through the "refiners fire" to help us become who God wants us to become. If life were easy, what need would there have been for a Savior?\\n\\nHere is a scripture that often helps me when I feel like my problems are too great. It is a revelation to a modern day prophet who was struggling with many trials, including being falsely accused and thrown into prison. This is what the Lord told him:\\n\\n5 If thou art called to pass through atribulation•; if thou art in perils among false brethren; if thou art in bperils• among robbers; if thou art in perils by land or by sea;\\n\\n6 If thou art aaccused• with all manner of false accusations; if thine enemies fall upon thee; if they tear thee from the society of thy father and mother and brethren and sisters; and if with a drawn sword thine enemies tear thee from the bosom of thy wife, and of thine offspring, and thine elder son, although but six years of age, shall cling to thy garments, and shall say, My father, my father, why can’t you stay with us? O, my father, what are the men going to do with you? and if then he shall be thrust from thee by the sword, and thou be dragged to bprison•, and thine enemies prowl around thee like cwolves• for the blood of the lamb;\\n\\n7 And if thou shouldst be cast into the apit•, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the bdeep•; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to chedge• up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of dhell• shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee eexperience•, and shall be for thy good.\\n\\n8 The aSon of Man hath bdescended• below them all. Art thou greater than he?\\n\\n9 Therefore, ahold on thy way, and the priesthood shall bremain• with thee; for their cbounds• are set, they cannot pass.

revelations i think is filled with alot of metafors that leaves alot to debate.. the rapture is near i think because the bible talks about not attacking gods people and all the countries around iseral is coming toeghter and they might attack them soon the a great fire will come from above(gods fire,nuke,many other ideas nobody knows) so to me that is another sign that the rapture is near so keep in the faith because jesus will sneak in like a theif and take us(the saved) away..we will never know when..ps i like revelations

A LRRP in Vietnam was basically a group of Army Rangers who volunteered to go into deep patrols in a certain area. Their primary mission was to gather intelligence on the NVA and VC. Organized in six man teams, they were often used for other special operations tasks like guerrilla warfare (laying ambushes, terrifying enemies, etc), forward observation, etc. These men were high trained and very brave for doing this... after all, there was only six of them in middle of Indian Country, always outnumbered... the slightest mistake would kill them all.

A white dwarf is both more massive and denser than a brown dwarf.   A white dwarf was once a fully-qualified ordinary star, producing energy from nuclear fusion.   But a brown dwarf was never massive enough for nuclear fusion to start.   Density of a white dwarf about 2 tonnes/cc.   Mass; within an order of magnitude the mass of the Sun.   Density of brown dwarf; a few grams/cc.   Mass less than a fiftieth that of the Sun.

An Oracle Database Administrator holds a key role in keeping the system up and running and hence, whatever business it supports up and running. It is a very technical role. They are typically the ones who move objects (tables, views, triggers, functions...) from one environment to the next (Development-->test-->production). They work closely with developers who write software to read/write/update/delete data to and from the database.  They monitor database size allocations and make adjustments for growth. they determine proper data elements that should be used for indexes so that searches against the database run quickly for customers. There is much more. It is a demanding job and they are often the first ones who are required to 'get the system back up and running' when the database goes nutty. (like when someone accidently submits a wacked out query doing a full table scan.\\na SUN administrator is different than a DBA because they do not focus on the database but they keep the server hardware running that the database runs on. They monitor server performance and deploy other custom written unix or java applications that programmers have developed. they too get involved with 'getting the system back up' when something goes haywire. It is also a very technical role and requires great knowledge of the unix commands and operating system.

The price probably won't get that high.\\n\\n1) Eventually Iraq's oil infrastructure will be up and running, which will cushion the market.\\n\\n2) Demand has to level off eventually. There just isn't enough capital to sustain prices even where they are now. People will have to find ways to conserve/alternate energy. That will mean prices level off.\\n\\n3) The big dogs like US, PRC, and Russia have enough soft power to lean on OPEC nations to increase production. They don't have to invade, they just have to threaten them with embargos and the like.\\n\\nEven if those three things don't do the trick, invasion won't actually help much. It's cheaper to pay the Saudi royal family a cut off the top than to subdue a bunch of very irritated Arabs wish kalashnikovs and plastic explosive.

Yes, I have, she was my best friend for many years, until I started making really good money she became unglued and I could see that underneath it all there was a world of envy and jealousy towards me and left her, when I bought a used luxury car she cursed at me and said, I'll never have anything else, blah, blah, blah, and she envied a lot of people, so I knew it was time to call it quits!\\n\\nThough I've missed her, I am better off without her, with friends like her who needs enemies, she also called me a b*** I did nothing to her.

Okay, lets put it in english rather than these morons who just wiki'd 'stem cells'\\n\\nBasically Speaking, a 'Stem Cell' is a blank cell. It has the functions of a cell that is in the body, but has no specific recognition. It has to be placed and fused with other cells to copy those characteristics. Think of it as White paint. it will stay white paint, but if you mix it with a different colour, it will change to be like the other colour. its pretty much a cell with no obdy information that has to be told what it is supposed to do.
I think it's a smokescreen. There's a lot of noise being raised about Ms. Clinton, and most of it's coming from the Republicans. I think the plan is to get the recognition factor going, and hope that she gets nominated, because the GOP think they'll have an easy time beating her. If they try that Swift Boat garbage with her, they just might. She's a very polarizing figure, and if you've been on Yahoo Answers awhile, you know that there's people that absolutely despise the Clinton name. As for why Spitzer or Biden isn't mentioned, it's whistling past the graveyard.

Unfortunately, you are mistaken.  Nearly all horses can run the initial 2 furlongs in 24 seconds or less, yet very few can run the last 2 furlongs in less than 24 seconds.  The pace of the race and the outcome are determined by multiple factors.  If you have a horse in a race and that horse is the "controlling speed" many times you have the winner.  If that same horse is not the "controlling speed" and gets "hooked", i.e. a horse breaks even beside it, that horse, unless he is a superior animal will not win the race.  The pace will quicken and both horses will tire mid-stretch and be beaten.  A horse coming from well off the pace will benefit by a fast pace up front, provided one single horse does not clear the field and slow the fractions down.  In other words, the faster the race is run in the early stages, the more likely a horse mid-running or closing from well back will run past them late in the race.\\nThere is NO mathematical solution, regarding acceleration, stride length that has ever stood the test of time. \\nHence, IF the "fastest" horse always won, the favorites would win 100% of the time.  Industry wide, the "fastest/betting favorite" only wins 38% of the time. That means that 62% of the time the "fastest/betting favorite" loses. \\nGood luck, but the game involves much more than mathematical equations.  There are different surfaces, multiple drugs administered, and many trainers are not even trying to win TODAY, they would much rather win later at bigger odds. \\nThat, in a nutshell, is the reality.\\nI'm a 50+ year old man who has played horses for over 35 years and numbers should only be a guide, never the rule.\\nI would be happy to further elaborate if need be. \\nGood luck to you

The paper is called "papyrus". The ancient Egyptian capital was Amarna. Jars that held embalmed organs were called "canopic jars". Osiris was the god of the dead and lord of the underworld.

Interactive whiteboards e.g Smartboard provide a large screen where students can move items, annotate, discuss video clips - the size and interactivity promotes discussion and questioning.  You can also use handheld devices and do learning in small groups 'on the go' - check out Futurelab mediascape as an example.  Again it adds additional material which provides points for discussion.  Another good tool is Turning point - it can save lots of time as you get instant feedback on answers so the teacher can tell how the group is getting on or how they feel about their work - it's also fun.  Many schools use laptops - can be an individual use, but also you can get students to collaborate e.g. on research or making video clips to illustrate their learning.  The most important point, no matter what tool you use, is that you consider how the students will use it and how the technology will enhance their learning - will it encourage them to research in more depth or to discuss their work in more detail, or to explore it in a 3D rather than flat dimension.

One-hundred and ninety-eight teams attempted to qualify for the 2006 World Cup Thirteen places were contested by UEFA teams (Europe), 5 by CAF teams (Africa), 4 by CONMEBOL teams (South America), 4 by AFC teams (Asia), and 3 by CONCACAF teams (North and Central America and Caribbean). The remaining two places were decided by playoffs between AFC and CONCACAF and between CONMEBOL and OFC (Oceania).\\n\\n\\njust thought of giving you an idea\\n\\n\\nwell i think that Uruguay and Egypt and Cameroon should have qualified

The Helios Gene Gun is a new way for in vivo transformation of cells or organisms (i.e. gene therapy and genetic immunization (DNA vaccination)). This gun uses Biolistic ® particle bombardment where DNA- or RNA-coated gold particles are loaded into the gun and you pull the trigger. A low pressure helium pulse delivers the coated gold particles into virtually any target cell or tissue. The particles carry the DNA so that you do not have to remove cells from tissue in order to transform the cells.YOU CAN GO TO THE LISTED SOURCES TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE GENE GUN AND U CAN ALSO SEE A PICTURE

There is no such thing as the perpendicular bisector of a triangle. You can, however, find the perpendicular bisector of any of the three sides of the triangle. \\n\\nSuppose you have a triangle called ABC and you wish to find the perpendicular bisector of the side AB. Simply put the point of a compass at point A and open up the compass so that the pencil end is at point B. Then draw a circle. Now put the point of the compass on point B and the pencil end on point A and draw another circle. The two circles will intersect at two points which you might name E and F. Now draw a line through E and F and passing through AB. This line will be the perpendicular bisector of AB.\\n\\nEvery triangle has three altitudes. In the triangle ABC, the line drawn from C perpendicular to the side AB is an altitude, so is the line drawn from B perpedicular to the line AC, and so is the line drawn from A perpendicular to the line BC.\\n\\nThe area of a triangle = 1/2 base times altitude. So if you know the area (A) and the base (b) then altitude = 2A/b.\\n\\nHope this gives you the info you were looking for.

Stock : An instrument that signifies an ownership position (called equity) in a corporation, and represents a claim on its proportional share in the corporation's assets and profits. Ownership in the company is determined by the number of shares a person owns divided by the total number of shares outstanding. For example, if a company has 1000 shares of stock outstanding and a person owns 50 of them, then he/she owns 5% of the company. Most stock also provides voting rights, which give shareholders a proportional vote in certain corporate decisions. Only a certain type of company called a corporation has stock; other types of companies such as sole proprietorships and limited partnerships do not issue stock. also called equity or equity securities or corporate stock.

I was 16 and yes it was painful.  As a mature older adult, I look back on my youth frequently and question some of the things I did.  I know that I had sex when I was young because I was looking for something or someone who cared about me or made me feel special or significant.  My parents were very strict and never spoke with me about sex or anything of any controversial nature.  I know now that I was way too young to appreciate sex and relationships and that I only used sex as a way to feel connected to someone.  WRONG REASON at 16!!!  I believe that sex is an important part of a healthy mature relationship and I don't believe in abstinence until you are married, but I do think that sex at too young an age leads to somewhat more promiscuous sex, irresponsible sex, and loveless sex.  Sex in a healthy mature relationship can be amazing and exciting. But I believe that when young people experiment with sex too early it can lead to a lacksadaisical approach to intimacy in adult years.  Most young people don't have the life experience to fully comprehend the emotions associated with sex - good or bad.

A ligament is a short band of tough fibrous connective tissue composed mainly of long, stringy collagen fibres. Ligaments connect bones to other bones to form a joint.\\n\\nCartilage is a type of dense connective tissue. Cartilage is composed of cells called chondrocytes which are dispersed in a firm gel-like ground substance, called the matrix. Cartilage is avascular (contains no blood vessels) and nutrients are diffused through the matrix. Cartilage is found in the joints, the rib cage, the ear, the nose, in the throat and between intervertebral disks. There are three main types of cartilage: hyaline, elastic and fibrocartilage. The main purpose of cartilage is to provide a framework upon which bone deposition could begin.

Acoustic guitars cannot be plugged in. They have no electronics. Acoustic /Electric guitars look the same as Acoustic[they are both hollow-bodied]. The only difference is that Acoustic/Electrics can be plugged in. They have a jack and a small pickup which is not highly visible yet allows the instrument to be plugged into an amplifier which increases the volume of the instrument[also allows electronic effects to be added to enhance sound quality during performance].

Try every putter you can get your hands on.  Ask if you can use the on the putting green.  Heavy putter's for slow greens and light putters for fast greens.  Stay away from the putter that take all day to line up.  When you come across a putter that looks good and feels good.  That is the one for you, it may be $19.95 or more.  All putters feel different.  So, make sure when you find the one you like, get that putter.

I think that most politicians want what is best for their constituents, generally speaking. The bad apples get a lot of press coverage & it just seems like most are corrupt.\\n\\nI personally believe that Bush, Cheney and Rove are corrupt.  They are all arrogant & Bush abuses the power of his office as much as he can get away with. But I have noticed that we haven't been seeing Bush's smirk (I would just love to wash that smirk off his face) in a while.\\n\\nWhen the Presidency appears to be corrupt, it demoralizes the citizenry & it's easy to believe that all politicians are corrupt as well.\\n\\nI'm 60.  I don't think that there is any more or less media coverage on corruption now than there has been in the past.

It always seems the moment a girl gets a boyfriend they get a whole lot more attention from the other guys in  their life.  I'd think it's just playful flirting and maybe trying to assert themselves a little as men...or perhaps to keep you and your bf from not hanging out with them (like to show they're comfortable with you- maybe now that you're off limits)

The vibrator is encouraging....\\nExpand on that.  I suspect that she has some kind of mental block - if she's had an orgasm in front of you, she should be able to have another.  And another, and another...\\n\\nSpeaking as a woman who had trouble with that for a long time, just be patient.  If you like her as much as you say, it'll be worth the wait.  Encourage her to try other things, both together and separately.  Try taking her into the shower, and show her by your touch how much you want for her to feel good.  And how good she feels to you.  She'll come around.\\n\\nAt least she's being honest... I'm amazed at how many women fake it and then lie about it!
Sure it is OK to like older women and go out with them as long as you're both 18. More and more you see older women with younger men. It seems like it was always OK for older men and younger women now it is the woman's turn to get that young stuff. Heck, I am 50 years old and I think a 30 or 35 year old man would be great. Go for it!

You can add another IF...THEN...ELSE in the timer (double click the timer, or you can say in event Timer.OnTimer).\\nLet's said by default (interval is 1000), you have a set of instruction in Timer. And after the interval is changed to 3000, you want the timer "do" something else.\\nWell just do like this\\nTimer.OnTimer\\n  IF (Timer.Interval = 1000) THEN\\n   {your instruction here}\\n  ELSE IF (Timer.Interval = 3000) THEN\\n   {your instruction here}\\n  ELSE\\n   {your instruction here};\\nend;\\nLike that. That way, the timer will do something different each time you change the interval. You can add more (ELSE IF... THEN) if you want more instruction for different intervals.

Years ago when I was trampin', I went through probably several cases of beer and 2 or 3 oz. of pot a day, every day. When I was jammin', which was most of the time, I had a golden combination I loved. I'd drop about 5 reds, wait a half hour and drop 15 whites. I stayed wasted just jammin' down the highway from people handing me beer, wine, booze, you name it, out their windows to me as I'd pass. Being totally wasted all the time became part of my personality. People who new me couldn't even tell any more. I rode my scooter all over the country like that. Never  got busted, even when I'd get busted for assault. I got busted for assault all the time but no convictions cause it was always self defense. Anyway, yeah, shoot I can't say I wouldn't cause I did. Never had an accident either.

Details??\\nFor details a good references is given by one before me.\\n\\nConcept:\\n\\nHydrates of carbon are carbohydrates.\\nThis is why the ration of H & O is always 2:1\\nGeneral formula of carbohydrates is CnH2nOn where n is a natural number.\\n\\nThere are different carbohydrates.\\nThe basic unit of carbohydrate is known as sacride.\\nOne sacride unit may contain 3, 4, 5 or 6 carbon atoms. So for 6 C atoms the formula will be C6H12O6.\\n\\nThese sacride unites in pure form are known as monosacrides. Glucose is one example.\\n\\nSome times two or more monosacride units combine to form a big molecule. In such cases the compounds are referred as di sacrides or tri sacrides etc. Sucrose (sugar) is a di sacride.\\n\\nSome times monosacrides form long chains such as cotton. These are called polysacrides.

Sugar (as in the normal stuff you buy in bags from the store) is a good source of energy and rather than make you slow will in fact make you fast.  A better option would be glucose (one of the several different types of sugar) as the body breaks this down into energy very quickly.  Many top atheletes use glucose to boost their performance.  It's best taken in the run up to the game and during the game as well.  You can take it in powdered form, diluted in water, syrup or as candy.

Try Monty Python movies such as "The Life of Brian", "And Now For Something Completely Differnt", or the infamous: "And the Quest for the Holy Grail."  You might first want to look up Monty Python or Monty Python Flying Circus on Yahoo! videos to see if you like their humor.  It's British, but extremely eccentric.  Next, their is any movie by Mel Brooks (e.g. The History of the World Part I, Young Frankenstein, Robin Hood, Men in Tights, etc. etc.), or you could try Airplane! (that one is hilarious!)\\nIf you can, and are a fan of zombie movies, try and watch Shaun of the Dead.  Great!!  It makes fun of the old zombie movies, and even includes such classic lines as "They're coming to get you Barbara!" (from the original black and white Night of the Living Dead).  Great Stuff.
3/18. Just multiply the numerator of one fraction by that of the other. Do the same with the denominator. 1x3=3 over 2x9=18. Since 3 and 18 are both divisible by 3, divide each by 3. The final answer: 1/6.

There is a lot of confusion over what is left and right.  I prefer to compare parties based on if they are authoritarian or freedom-loving.  Communists are among the most authoritarian, as are socialists and fascists, and many of the parties based on enforcing dogma.  Typically, the left has been composed of those groups that want to redistribute income, and to do this one must be authoritarian, such as the communists, so it is not surprising that they are called leftist.  \\n\\nI much prefer to see freedom and liberty.  Communists have oppressed too many people in the history of the world, and it is time to move away from their wishful, utopian ideologies, once and for all.

Parole is getting out of prison early.  During the time out early, strick rules governing where one lives, works, interacts with others and such must be followed or it's back to prison again.  \\n\\nEarly release on parole is based on good behavior.  (Although some people are sentenced to prison with no chance of parole regardless of how good the behavior.)  But even if someone has the chance of parole and has good behavior, they might not get out if their crime was horrendous or if the victim or the victim's family actively object to parole.  \\n\\nThat's pretty much what I understand of it from watching TV.

The key to football is not like any sport. Sports are about using your athletic ability to complement the game in hand. In football you use your brain more, and in defence this is more so. People are saying your good, and this proves you have the sporting ability.\\n\\nEvery time somebody runs at you with the ball (which will happen a lot playing full back) have a think about where hes going, and when hes going to put the ball in the box. Watch the ball and the feet, and get used to thinking quickly.\\n\\nAnother good tip for a full back is practice coming forward. You may be a defender, but it is good to support your wingers. Overlap them when they hold the ball up and practise your crossing so they can lay you off by the byline.\\n\\nStay fit and healthy, because to be a good right back, your going to need to get up and down the pitch. Im not sure what level your playing on, but anothe good tip is to listen to your coach. He may not always be right, but discipline will reflect on the pitch.\\n\\nAlso, try simple training methods;\\njuggling- control\\npassing against a wall back to your feet- passing and control\\nskills- if your up to it, watch and try and repeat\\n\\nGood luck!
always eat breakfast, EXERCISE, drink lots of water, eat small meals throughout the day.  the laxatives have slowed your metabolism now that your body wasn't doing the work, the laxatives were.  laxatives should be used sparingly, as you found out the hard way by getting addicted.  try the above to regulate your metabolism all over again.  also your metabolism will increase if you exercise and gain muscle, which in turn helps you not be constipated.  but water is very very important as well......

From the research and advice I've gotten, your cousework is more important than the program's accreditation.

Both organizations are reputable.\\n\\nGood luck!

there are 2 pulse points on your arms.the wrist which known as the radial pulse and the inner side at the joint between your forarm and arm which is known as the brachial pulse. there is one at your neck andthis is the most prominent pulse point and is known as the catotid pulse.\\nat the lower part of your tummy there is one pulse point but it is very hard to feel it and it is known as the aortic pulse and usually clinicians seldom assess this pulse point. however it may become very prominent in a person with acute aortic anuerysm( a mediacal condtion where there is enlargement of aorta, a big artery in body, and this is a medical emergency)\\nthere is one pulse point at the joint between the torsal and the leg (known as the inguinal region)and this pulse point is known as the femoral pulse. at the back of the knee joint there is also a pluse point. it is known as the popliteal pulse. it is relatively harder to be felt and in orderto have a better feeling you can actually try to relax your leg and straighten and press harder with thumb at the knee join and the three fingers pressing at the pulse point.\\nthere is one pulse point at the point 2cm behind and 2cm under the ankle and it is known as the posterior tibialis pulse. the other pulse point is on foot and it is known as the dorasalis pedis pulse.all the pulse points mentioned above except forthe aortic pulse are all found at both left and right side of the body.

No. The Civil war took place approximately a hundred years AFTER the USA became a country, and was a war between the citizens of the US, mainly between northern states and southern states.

The market is 'risk efficient': investment vehicles with the highest reward also have the highest risk.\\n\\nAs an example, ETFs of emerging stock markets have performed best in the last 2 years, but they are extremely risky and volatile (check the market action in the last few weeks).\\n\\nOne way to reduce risk while maintaining performance is to diversify: by holding ETFs covering different asset classes (such as US, foreign, small-cap etc...), the risk of your total portfolio will be less than the risk of its components taken separately.
Riiiiiiiiiiiight. \\n\\nNever work on the problem; just get rid of those that notice it. The ole "sweep the problem under the rug" trick. Even though I love my job, I hate how the place is run. Disgruntled employee? Well YEAH! I am. And time and time again I see morale issues being handled by reprimanding us and telling us to "act professionally." Threats being made to people that are unhappy with how something is run is ludicrious. It's such a "control" thing. People in authority hate to say, "I'm wrong." So they transfer blame to the common man and try to make the weak feel weaker. It blows my mind that not all people are willing to step back from a situation and seriously look at solutions to the greater whole. \\n\\nSure, fire all of the unhappy people. You will then probably have an empty workplace. But hey.....there won't be any complaints about how you run things now. *cough* Until you hire your next bunch of heathens. ;)

Bluetooth is a low power short range radio communications technology for connecting equipment together when it requires relatively little bandwidth. Typical uses are for attaching PDAs to peripherals (I have a bluetooth GPS receiver semi permanently installed in my car) and connecting headsets to mobile phones. It opperates on the same frequencies as 802.11b/g but uses different spread spectrum encoding so that they can coexist even though the 802.11 uses vastly more power.
The Great Wall of China (Simplified Chinese:  Traditional Chinese: Pinyin: Wànlĭ Chángchéng; literally "10,000 Li¹ long wall") is a Chinese fortification built from 3rd century BC until the beginning of the 17th century, in order to protect the various dynasties from raids by Mongol, Turkic, and other nomadic tribes coming from areas in modern-day Mongolia and Manchuria. Several walls were built since the 3rd century BC, the most famous being the Great Wall built between 220 BC and 200 BC by the First Emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi, which was located much further north than the current Great Wall of China built during the Ming Dynasty, and little remains.\\n\\nThe Wall stretches over a formidable 6,352 km (3,948 miles), from Shanhai Pass on the Bohai Sea in the east, at the limit between China proper and Manchuria, to Lop Nur in the southeastern portion of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (refer to University of Washington: A. The Main Caravan Routes (b) The “Central Route” or “Middle Route.”)\\n\\nHISTORY \\n\\nA defensive wall on the northern border was built and maintained by several dynasties at different times in Chinese history. Its purpose, to defend the China mainland from nomadic Mongolians. There have been five major walls:\\n\\n208 BC (Qin Dynasty) \\n1st century BC (Han Dynasty) \\n7th century CE (Sui Dynasty) \\n1138 - 1198 (Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period) \\n1368 - 1640 (from Hongwu Emperor until Wanli Emperor of the Ming Dynasty) \\nThe first major wall was built during the reign of the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang. This wall was not constructed as a single endeavor, but was mostly the product of joining several regional walls built by the Warring States. The walls that were linked together at this time consisted of rammed earth with watch towers built at regular intervals. It was located much further north than the current Great Wall with its eastern end at modern day North Korea. Very little of this first wall remains - photos reveal a low, long mound.\\n\\nThe government ordered people to work on the wall, and workers were under perpetual danger of being attacked by brigands. Because many people died while building the wall, it has obtained the gruesome title, "longest cemetery on Earth" or "the long graveyard." Possibly as many as one million workers died building the wall, though the true numbers cannot be determined now.\\n\\nThe later long walls built by the Han, the Sui, and the Ten Kingdoms period were also built along the same design. They were made of rammed earth with multi-story watch towers built every few miles. These walls have also largely vanished into the surrounding landscape, eroded away by wind and rain.\\n\\nIn military terms, these walls were more frontier demarcations than defensive fortifications of worth. Certainly Chinese military strategy did not revolve around holding the wall, instead it was the cities themselves which were fortified.\\n\\nThe Great Wall which tourists visit today was built during the Ming Dynasty, starting around the year 1368 and lasting till around 1640. Work on the wall started as soon as the Ming took control of China but initially, walls were not the Ming's prefered response to raids out of the north. That attitude began to change in response to the Ming's inablilty to defeat the Oirat war leader Esen Taiji in the period 1449 to 1454. A huge Ming army with the Zhengtong Emperor at its head was anihilated in battle and the emperor himself held hostage in 1449.\\n\\nAppearently the real focus on wall building started as a result of Altan Khan's siege of Beijing which took place one hundred years later in 1550. The Ming, faced with the choice of trying to defeat the Mongols with direct military force, choose instead to build a massive defensive barrior to protect China. As a result, most of the Ming Great Wall was built in the period 1560 to 1640. This new wall was built on a grand scale with longer lasting materials (s

Iron sulfate and sodium borate are ionic. SiC2 is covalent.  (This is due to the proximity, or lack thereof, of each main element in the periodic table.)  The concept of polar/nonpolar is used only with covalent molecules to describe whether or not they have a sufficient dipole moment to interact with other polar/nonpolar molecules.  I don't know the arrangement of atoms in SiC2 but, if the molecule is linear, the moment of the two Si-C bonds cancel out and it is nonpolar.  If SiC2 is bent, it's polar.

Its genetic, different races have different traits.  Blacks are taller than whites, they have lower body fat % and are more athletic.  Certain characteristics are genetic, and others are just society.  Asians are intelligent, its hard to say whether or not this is because they are born with bigger brains, or education is just more emphases in their families.  Someone should do a study that charts how someone of different racial back round goes through life when being raised in a different culture.  If an Asian boy was raised by a black family, would he still do excel in school? Or would he be more athletic?  Its hard to say, but as far a physical attributes go, cultures are made different to adapt to their environment.  It doesn't matter if you believe in evolution or not, black people have dark skin for a reason, its hot as hell where they are from, and the sun is scorching.  this could go on forever, but i hope this helps kind of answer your question.

"por" means times, as in 2x4=8 (Dos POR cuatro IGUAL ocho)\\n\\nson/as I dont understand, the basic math funcions are:\\n- (menos) minus\\n+ (mas)   plus\\nx (Por)   times \\n/ (Dividido) divided by\\n\\na thing that can be is "sen" (seno) instead of "son" and means sinus. if i am in the correct line "AS" then is arcoseno and means "Arcsin".\\n\\nand y means either an incognit, such as in 2x+3y=4 or the simple and plain "and" of spanish language

It is quite possible that not everyone is as diligent in their work as you are. Also very possible that the workers in question think they are helping by doing what they do. Alot of the people in question had children who were American citzens, though their parents are not. Because the children themselves are eligible citizens, they can get welfare or food stamps to feed them. In fact, through an article in the L.A times, the county supervisor said that about 100,000 children of illegal immigrants in the county collect $276 million in annual welfare benefits. He also stated that 98,703 children of 57,458 undocumented parents received Cal-WORKS welfare checks in January, or a total of 156,161 recipients. Most of this was because the children were citizens. Though I am not familiar with Cal-Works or what benefit it entails, studies have found that due to 1996 restrictions, it is harder for illegals as well as natives to get welfare. But, the proportion of illegals who get food stamps and medacaid is significantly higher than that of the native population. In fact, it was found post 1996 reform that the percent of illegals who naturalized jumped significantly, all among those who had once received aid. It was also found that one in three families headed by an illegal immigrant is using one type of welfare or another. And because they are not usually educated people and are often low skill workers, the ones that do contribute taxes contribute much less than other families. For this reason, if we legalized them tax payments would increase 77%, but the net deficit would rise to 117%, because they would be legal to receive all the services that they are currently having difficulty accessing now.
Bj and the bear- B.J. McCay was a good-looking young trucker who traveled around the country in his big red & white rig, with a single companion - his pet chimp, Bear. B.J. was based in rural Georgia and was confronted by a succession of corrupt local sheriffs - Elroy P. Lobo (who was later given his own series, Lobo); Sgt. Wiley of Winslow County and his two fellow lawmen, Sheriffs Cain and Masters. The only honest cop B.J. seemed to encounter was the Fox, who spent much of her time trying to trap the crooked local cops. Tommy was a lady trucker friend and Bullets ran the local hangout, the Country Comfort Truck Stop.In 1981, B.J. settled down to run a trucking business in Los Angeles called Bear Enterprises. His new adversary was Rutherford T. Grant, a corrupt politician who headed the state Special Crimes Action Team. Grant was a silent partner in   TransCal, the largest trucking firm in California and stopped at nothing to stomp out potential competition. Because of Grant's intervention, B.J. found it impossible to get regular truck drivers to work for him and had to settle for a crew of 7 young, beautiful lady truckers, including a pair of identical twins and Grant's daughter, Cindy.\\n   Hello Larry-Following the breakup of his marriage, radio talk-show host Larry Alder moved from Los Angeles to Portland, to get a fresh start. He got a job at a radio station KLOW, where Morgan Winslow became the producer for his phone talk show. Earl was Larry's obese engineer. Lary had been given custody of his two daughters, 13-year old Ruthie and 16-year old Diane. Glib and in total control of the air, he was much less sure of himself at home as the single parent of two maturing girls. Leona, a school teacher and neighbor, tried to bring a little of woman's touch to this chaotic household. Larry's ex-wife Marion ( Shelley Fabares) also turned up occasionally. Added to the regular cast in the fall of were former Harlem Globetrotters basketball star Meadowlark Lemon, playing himself as a owner of a sporting goods store, and Tommy, a 14-year old neighbor. In February 1980 Larry's retired father, Henry, also moved in.\\n Yes, you can by them

The seller should still resume sending you your item. If he doesnt, then you can always send in a complaint through ebay and your credit card company to refund you if you do not get your item within 1 month. \\n\\nYou were too quick to leave a negative feedback. When you leave a negative feedback, you will have to assume you will get one too. Those feedbacks represents your ebay reputation, so you should take that pretty seriously.\\n\\nUnless the seller refunds you manually, you should still be getting your item.\\n\\nNOTE: You can always withdraw your feedback by filling in a "feedback withdrawal" form through ebay. That way, both your negative feedbacks will get removed.
Cirrhosis can lead to extra fluid retention due to decreased albumin and plasma protein production. This drops oncotic pressure and leads to fluid retention. If the lungs have extra fluid in them, and decreases pulmonary function, the body may increase respiratory rate in as a reaction. Thus carbon dioxide is blown off because of the increased respiratory rate and a respiratory alkalosis occurs. That's my best guess.

The Akosombo Dam is a hydroelectric dam in southeastern Ghana. The dam created the largest man-made lake, known as Lake Volta. The dam provides electricity to Ghana and surrounding West African countries.\\n\\n\\nThe dam is 660 meters wide and 114 meters high. It was built between 1961 and 1965. In periods of drought, the water in Lake Volta is rationed and less electricity is generated. During these times, cities in Ghana are subjected to rolling blackouts to lessen their consumption of electricity. Ghana's Volta River Authority has contracts with neighbouring countries for electricity. These contracts are given higher priority than the customers in Ghana's own cities. Though Kaiser Aluminum is a major user, and the dam was constructed in part for the smelting of local bauxite, the economics have turned out such that raw materials have to be imported to keep the industry running.

No one should be treated as disrespectfully as that ... With a TEXT msg? Saying he was now single?. He sounds colossally immature and doesn't know what he wants or what he had with you. The way you are feeling now will subside and new and more exciting things will come to you. If he loves you, he will find you and be all that he should be and more, but he is not going to do it while you sit there and wait on him, allowing him to treat you like a part time pal/gf. Move on, make your own decisions and stop letting someone like that control your heart, head and choices!! This too shall pass my dear! :) \\nGood luck and thinking of you!

If all the software is installed properly and it is connected properly, try putting it into another USB port.\\n\\nIf all that fails, maybe its a bad cable.  Contact the place you purchased it from and let them know.  Give them a chance to replace the cable.

Not all guys or girls on the online dating sites are into games, but some are.  You just have to find the right person.

It is his choice to buy cigarettes, light up and smoke them. No one is holding a gun to his head and forcing him to do this. He keeps that smoking up and it will be the death of him yet. He is not immune to lung cancer or emphysema, these diseases are not prejudice.  He has his top priorites all wrong and he needs to decide what's more important...his smoking or his own health and his family.

I do and I'm a petroleum geologist. It will be impossible to determine when we actually hit peak until we go down the other side for a while. Most of the major oil companies are failing to replace their annual production with new discoveries, in some cases only replacing 60% of the year's production. As oil becomes more expensive there will be more and more nonconventional sources like oil-shale that come on line, but they will only make the back side of the curve a little more gentle. \\n\\nThe bigger problem may be the growing demand. World oil demand is at an all time high, over 80 million bbls a day, and shows no signs of demand deflation. \\n\\nNo, all our resources are not fossil fuels. We need to explore EVERY alternative, including nuclear, solar, wind, bio, tidal, geothermal, etc. Realize that the world's second and third largest oil companies are also the world's two largest manufacturers of solar cells. One of those oil companies is also one of the largest wind power operators in the world. The oil companies see the handwriting on the wall. We need to start saving oil for some of the products other than fuel for which oil is the raw material.
You would multiply 2 by 100 to make it a per cent so it would be 200%.  If the number was .2, you multiply that by 100 and you would get 20%.  If the number was .02, you x 100 = 2%.\\n\\nIf the number was 1/4, you still multiply by 100, and get 100/4 which would be 25%.\\n\\nI hope this helps.

They need to build an audience in a hurry to stay together as a band
This is an easy question and yet complex.  Every guys will want different things.  I like long hair, preferably red.  An attractive figure is also great.  Superficial acrostics aside, she needs to be able to carry a conversation.  I would rather have an average looking girl that is equally smart and can hold an intelligent conversation, rather than a perfect 10 that all guys drool over.  With a girl that is EXTREMELY beautiful you sometimes wonder if she is being faithful.  That takes allot of faith on the guys part to trust her  just as it takes trust for the girl to think the guys is not cheating.  If the girl can't say anything smart allot of people will look at her and think/know she is a ditz.  I know I am rambling on so, in my opinion intelligence, good looks, loyalty, willingness to compromise, horneyness.

No he won't be impeached.  You spend too much time on the internet or listening to talk radio.  Why don't you just look up what is really going on and stop paying attention to the rhetoric?\\n\\nThe person above is wrong.  If Bush is impeached (and he won't be), Cheney will not become president.  Bush will stay president, because he will be found "not guilty."

First of all why do some men marry ? To celebrate their relationship , to belong to the woman they love , to have a friend , to have a family of their own .\\nI guess the others refuse because of fear of taking responsibility (once you are committed/married, all major decision of life are influenced by it e.g., changing job, moving to new location etc. ) or fear of confiding in other person so much as to make them a part of your life and become theirs . Some do not believe in the institution of marriage because for their own reasons . \\nWomen generally want to stay in a relationship & work on it even if it is not going on the right track with the hope that it might work . Guys dont . They know if its not a correct choice , its not worth giving life for .\\n And for some , variety is the spice of life :))
Yes. As someone who's dealt with depression personally, I can tell you that depression is not just sadness. Depression can also cause irritability and mood swings. \\n\\n"Depression is a treatable illness involving an imbalance of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters. It is not a character flaw or a sign of personal weakness. You can’t make yourself well by trying to "snap out of it." Although it can run in families, you can’t catch it from someone else. The direct causes of the illness are unclear, however it is known that body chemistry can bring on a depressive disorder, due to experiencing a traumatic event, hormonal changes, altered health habits, the presence of another illness or substance abuse."\\n\\nSymptoms of Depression \\n\\nProlonged sadness or unexplained crying spells \\nSignificant changes in appetite and sleep patterns \\nIrritability, anger, worry, agitation, anxiety \\nPessimism, indifference \\nLoss of energy, persistent lethargy \\nFeelings of guilt, worthlessness \\nInability to concentrate, indecisiveness \\nInability to take pleasure in former interests, social withdrawal \\nUnexplained aches and pains \\nRecurring thoughts of death or suicide
ok if u want to talk to the guy talk to him but the best thing to do is wait for him to talk to u because if you wait for him to talk to u then u will kno if he likes u or not because if he likes u then he will talk to u first but if he dosnt like u then he wont talk to u at all but if u like the guy and u want to talk to him then u go right ahead and talk to him but i would wait for him to talk to u and if he says hi to u then ya say hi back and smile
They can be used (practically) for taking measurements. They also crop up in periodic motion and lots of other areas of mathematics. They are functions of angles. \\n\\nIt is simplest to see from a right triangle ABC, where the angle B is the 90 degree angle. In this angle the length of the side AB might be called a, the length of the side BC might be called b and the length of the side CA might be called c. (draw it out.)\\n\\n\\nSide c is the hypotenuse.\\n\\n For angle A, the Opposite side is b. For Angle A, the Adjacent side is a.\\n\\nFor Angle C, the opposite side is a, the Adjacent side is b.\\n\\nGiven this triangle, \\nthe sin(A) = Opposite/Hypotenuse = b/c.\\ncos(A) = Adjacent/Hypotenuse = a/c.\\ntan(A) = sin(A)/cos(A) = b/a = Opposite/Adjacent.\\n\\n\\nIf you're measuring height of a building and know how far you are from the building (adjacent side) and the angle you must look up to see the top edge of the building, tou can use (adjacent*tan(angle looking up)) = height of building.
Just because the laptop has an external video connection does not mean it supports a seperate display.\\nLet me clarify:  Most laptops are fully capable of what is called "mirroring."  This is what you're seeing.  Certain laptop video cards in recent years do allow you to split your desktop so that you can see different views on each available screen.\\nFrom looking at the general specs on IBM's website (see sources) it mentions a 16MB ATI Radeon 7500 video card.  The second link in Sources is the direct link to the *standard graphics card's specifications.\\nIf it was capable of allowing you to split the video signal to both the Laptop's built in screen and the external monitor, it would state something like "dual channel supported."

Paris Reidhead\\n1919-1992\\n\\n     Paris Reidhead devoted his life to communicating the message of the Gospel in America and throughout the world. A student pastor in the rural Minnesota at age eighteen, Mr. Reidhead felt led of the Lord to overseas mission work. In 1945, Paris Reidhead and Marjorie, his wife of two years, traveled under the auspices of the Sudan Interior Mission to the Sudan-Ethiopia Border where they surveyed and analyzed tribal languages in preparation for evangelism and education in this area.\\n\\n     Upon his return to the United States, Mr. Reidhead was appointed Deputation Secretary of the Sudan Interior Mission in the Southeastern United States. He was soon a nationally recognized spokesman for missions.\\n\\n     In 1953 Mr. Reidhead began his national Bible Conference ministry for the Christian and Missionary Alliance which brought him, in 1956, to pastorate of the Gospel Tabernacle, the New York City church where the C & M A was first established by Dr. A. B. Simpson in 1887. While in New York, Mr. Reidhead drew on informational resources at the United Nations to pioneer a program through which government and private funds were used for economic development in the Third World; his efforts to implement local programs on this model took him to mission fields in Africa, Asia, and South America.\\n\\n     Third World development became his full-time commitment in 1966. Mr. Reidhead's vision of public-private funding for economic development led, in 1971, to the formation of the Institute for International Development, Inc. which has served as the model for about ninety evangelical organizations which have, in turn, channeled more than 100 million dollars into Third World development. In 1984, Mr. Reidhead founded Enterprise Development International, a service agency devoted to aiding Third World church and evangelical agencies in creating job opportunities for destitute families.\\n\\n     Since Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, and a dedicated Board. The message of the Gospel is reaching an ever-widening audience all over the world

I hope it does because women sports is the real thing they actuall play the game in guys sports they gotta act like babies and complain when a foul is made and do a lotta stupid fighting although i like the fights! it gets a little recognition but not as much as it deseves, the only reason guy sports are popular is because they are stupid and bring a lotta drama to the game, to me women sports is the real thing and they play the game that's why guys don't want to watch it cause they think they rule the world of sports and they think that it should be filled with stupid stuff!
UN pays their volunteers reasonably well.  And you also get diplomatic status everywhere you go.  The perks are not all monetary in the beginning but eventually if you pursue a career in development it may also pay you much.  If you're into cultural diversity, travelling to remote places, charity, challenging yourself to contribute something to society or if you want to be a politician then that is a good start.  It's not all humanitarian work, you also learn how governments prioritize the use of their money and how they tie aid with certain interests.
I would personally recommend the basic (GNOME) Ubuntu. It is IMO, the simplest and easiest to use. Also, since more people use it, you get better community support. If this is your first Linux, then go for GNOME, since KDE is a little more advanced and complicated.\\n\\nXubuntu uses Xfce instead of GNOME or KDE. Xfce is made to be a sort of "light GNOME". I've never actually used it, but I really recommend it if your PC has less than 256 mb of RAM.\\n\\nAlso, be aware that each Desktop Environment and Ubuntu flavour comes with a different set of applications. For example, if I remember correctly, Ubuntu comes with OpenOffice.org, Kubuntu with Koffice, and Xubuntu with GNOME-office (Abiword and Gnumeric). Xubuntu and Ubuntu come with Firefox, Kubuntu comes with Konqueror. And so on.

WHOA- BABY!  \\nI have seen this one before and the first thing that you have to do is stop the teasing!   Teasing can only lead to someone getting hurt!  If this is a good friend then be up front and honest and say \\n"I have been teasing you and for that I am sorry.  I still want to be friends", leave it at that and STOP the teasing.  \\n\\nTrust me some one will get hurt if you don't stop.  I can not guarantee that some one might already be hurt by what has gone on so far.\\n\\nBest of luck.

I dont know why people are racist. It's just been an ongoing thing that has happened since eternity. If you asked me, I think it's absolutely stupid, as well as ignorant. Theirs this whole mentality, in which people believe their superior to other races, but in reality we're all the same people. The only thing that's different is our skin color, and our cultures. But deep down, you have the rebel person from a culture, that relates to another rebel in a different culture, you have the preppy person that relates to another preppy person in a different culture, you have the shy kid from a culture that can relate to another kid in a different culture. To sum things up, WE'RE ALL THE SAME, no matter what. I just wish people would take those topics into consideration, and just realize that we are the same people, and leave behind the fact of wanting to put others down, or block their successes just because of their races.

It's not much what you say as all the other "little" things you must do on the date. Like being on time, maybe greeting her with a quick light peck on the cheek, pulling out her chair, open doors...you know all the "gentlemanly" things. As for conversation, keep it light, funny, interesting. And although you may want to start a relationship with her, on your first "real" date, you probably shouldn't bring that up as yet. Wait until you've been on at least 3 dates, then broach the subject. By then you'll know if she's also romantically interested in you or if only as a friend.

When most people do that, they are trying to find people who will side with them to prove they are in the right. It makes him feel good for others to say "man, you were right, she's wrong".

OK- assuming this is a real spirit case and you are not crazy, the best thing you can do is not be afraid. He never hurt you before because you were never afraid before. It is like the movie Skeleton Key. Second: DO NOT TRY TO CONTACT HIM. You have no idea what you are doing, and you could get in way over your head in which case you could get hurt. I don't have an old family recipe for protection against spirits, so I could help you know more than a book or a google search on specifics, but there are plenty of books on protection. If you feel you need to call someone like a physic, but be aware that most are just frauds, and don't pay anything up front. I don't really have any better advice for you than that. Just don't fear him and he cannot harm you.

Your eye will be covered the day of surgery with a patch and a metal shield. Your glasses may not fit over the patch and shield, but your physician will probably remove the patch and shield the next day. You must then wear either your glasses or the shield while awake to protect your eye. You MUST wear the shield over your eye while sleeping. Do not rub your eye. You will see your physician in the clinic the day following surgery. You will then need to be checked periodically during the next 3 months. Your physician will determine how frequently you will need to return. Vision may be blurred in the operated eye right after surgery. It should gradually improve as healing progresses. Many patients see better within a few days. Between 4 and 12 weeks after surgery your physician will prescribe a new lens for your glasses.

Vestigial features (Note to creationists:  vestigial does not mean useless, do not bother lying that it does) demonstrate we are not now what we were in our past.  Our descending testes is a vestige of our reptilian days.  Our quadraped-style backs demonstrate we used to walk on four-legs and are only imperfectly adapted yet to two.\\n\\nEach and every human on the planet has a gene that would stimulate our hair growth to be as thick as a chimpanzee's, if it were working.  It's broken because it has a parasite in it.  Remove the parasite and we'd have nice, thick coating of fur.  Evolution explains this easily, we evolved from furry ancestors, the parasite is responsible for our current state.  Creationism has no explanation for why God would have created us with a broken gene, with a parasite, neither of which we actually want.\\n\\nOne gene we do want is a Vitamin C gene.  Untold masses of people have died throughout history due to lacking a way to make their own vitamin C.  But, we do have one.  It's just broken.  Our primate ancestors lived in fruit rich environments, making their own vitamin C was an unnecessary waste of energy, so a mutation killing the gene was a good thing.  Humans do *not* always live in such areas and a vitamin C gene would have saved many, many lives.  But instead, we have one broken, broken in EXACTLY the same way that a chimpanzee's is broken.  Why were we created wtih a broken vitamin C gene?  Why is it broken *exactly* the same way as a chimp's?  Still no answer from the creationists.\\n\\nThe evidence for evolution comes from all directions all the time.  The fossils demand evoluion, creationists being unable to explain any aspects of fossils sorting.  Biogeography demands evolution.  How, after the Flood, did all the animals manage to get back to the areas where their fossils are?  Why would they bother?  Where are the signs of the massive forest of eucalyptus it would take to get koala from the Ark back to Australia?  Scientists can piece together the motion of the continents from species distribution, creationists are left only with pretending it isn't enough.\\n\\nAs far as the "missing" link goes, this is primarily a press bugaboo.  There is no singular missing link.  Rather, we have a wide series of very non-missing links.  Classic case in point:\\n\\nhttp://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/compare.html\\n\\nHere you can see a list of some of the fossil skulls scientists claim are links between humans and the rest of the apes.  Creationists have to pretend that there are no transitions, each of those fossils is either "obviously" human or "obviously" ape.  But when you look at what they say is "obviously" what, you'll see they cannot even agree on which skulls are "obviously" which.  If it was really obvious, wouldn't they agree?  Wouldn't they come *close* to agreeing?\\n\\nThe only thing obvious about that chart is that the skulls really do seem to be transitional and creationist demands for a supposedly missing link are nothing but the equivalent of sticking one's fingers in one's ears and yelling, "DOES NOT" to make the evidence go away.
The males of those regions have the innate desire to dominate, and more particularly, to dominate women.

Nothing is bad or good in its own stead. It is the way it is used, implemented and taken up which makes it bad or good. In India reservation was and is used to please some people and get quick votes, be it SC&ST provisions in constitution which was original for 15 years or implementation of Mandal commission after years of lying in bag. There are many aspects of reservation. It is fact there are some strata of society who need support to rise from their current status of poverty or backwardness.\\n\\nHowever there is opposition for reservation because the benefit of it are not going to actual people rather they are taken up by some people of these society who are already in up class are taking up these benefits whereas actual needy people are still at the same place. No one will object if a really needy get the benefit, You and all are furious since it is someone who is not needy who is reaping benefit.\\n\\nAs far as making economic condition as criteria is concerned, there is always good and bad of all thoughts. Good about this will be that this should be the correct way of deciding giving help however there are too many lacuna in this as getting certificate for economic background is very easy to get since no one file income tax return and there no proof of incomes for people other than salaried people so what will happen ultimately is again people who do not deserve the benefit will get it and needy will remain eluded with this.\\nI agree that when it comes to job then what we need is competent people in jobs to provide proper service and let our country grow. It is wrong to say the people who need help to rise first time are not competent but what is required is that we bring them up and educate and train them so that they are competent enough to take up the challenges. Now if we talk about getting a doctor without enough skills. This is often repeated example but what we fail to understand that a person cannot be a doctor just by getting admission in medical college. S/he became doctor after passing out from the college. If we say that college examination system is such that they will pass person without knowledge then problem does not lie in reservation in admission but in examination system which required to be looked into. Having said that if education system is not good and it will allow person without skill to get the degree then what is guarantee that a person who has come by other route let us by paying higher fees or something and for that matter what is guarantee that a person who have scored 90+ marks is good in medical study. So then we are running risk of many doctors without skills operating on us. So this argument that if the person has come with reservation will be not competent doctor is not correct. If a person has passed MBBS (s/he can be anyone reserve one or other) and do not know how to use scalpel and then we should hung all the teachers who have taught them, people who have set the papers and all the examiners who has taken their practical exams and checker who checked their examination papers.\\n\\nSo mantra for anything to be good and successful is honest implementation of the same.
"The Way"  \\n\\nWould be walk in and drive through.\\n\\nWould serve fresh fruit, yougurt, healthy breads and fresh veggie and fruit juices in the mornings, in the afternoon it would offer an array of veggies, good carbs, healthy oils and fresh protiens (soy, fish, chicken, buffallo, beef...) and to up the ante for dinner, I would add dine-in multi course meals as oppossed to the traditional 'food on a tray', comprised of the same high quality fresh food.  It wouldn't either cater to Carnivores, Vegetarians or Vegans in particular.... simply offer the convenience of quality food for those that haven't the time to prepare it themselves.  \\n\\nAnd yes, I do think there is a market out there, even though the costs may be more than some are willing to pay.

this question makes no sense
"actually there has been a few recorded cases of male pregnancy and men giving birth twas the inspiration behind a movie starring arnold Schwarzenegger"\\n\\nI disagree.  The inspiration was that some women have delivered live babies which developed outside the womb; in the peritoneal cavity.  In these cases, the placenta of the ectopic pregnancy embeds itself into the walls of various abdominal organs.\\n\\nThe situation is very dangerous.  Commonly, ectopic conceptions end in massive haemorrhage, long before the foetus has any chance of surviving outside the mother's body.  Her life is endangered, as the bleeding is huge, and sometimes is hard to diagnose, in time to save her life.\\n\\nAnyhow, there has been speculation that an embryo from IVF could grow in a man's abdomen; clearly, a uterus is not an absolute requirement.  I think no ethics board could condone such an attempt, as his life would be endangered if the pregnancy ended in haemorrhage preterm.  [Well, it would be endangered anyhow, but it is extra yukky, if the baby dies too; the usual outcome!]\\n\\nI suspect that a male's body would also be unable to suppress his immune system enough to avoid rejection of the foreign tissues of the conceptus.  I am not sure, but I wonder if females are better able to do this complex immunological trick!\\n\\nBTW, all these cases must be dealt with surgically; it is major abdominal surgery!

Prepare adequately (study) for at least a week or more and don't stay up late each nite. Get plenty of rest on the day of the exam. Then on exam day, DO NOT EAT anything 1 hour before the exam. Eat something (high protein and non-greasy food only) 2 to 3 hours before the exam. Then right before the exam, drink soda pop (Mountain Dew or JOLT is preferred). This last advise is crucial. If you can't find any colas like Coke or Pepsi, drink honey mixed in water. You need the sugar, bottom line, specifically your brain. If you eat before the exam, your brain would be too busy to help you concentrate so eating before the exam is a no-no.

I wasn't able to find a specific site with much more than few sentences about him\\n\\nCharles Thilorier was a scientist who gave the earliest description of solid carbon dioxide. In 1834 he opened a pressurized container of liquid carbon dioxide, only to find that the cooling produced by the rapid evaporation of the liquid yielded a "snow" of solid CO2.\\n\\nDry Ice is the trademark for carbon dioxide in its solid form, frozen at -109.3° F or -79.5° C. It is primarily used as a refrigerant. Dry Ice does not melt but goes directly from a solid to a gas in a process called sublimation. It is generally accepted that French chemist, Charles Thilorier, was the first to record the appearance of it in 1835. The Dry Ice Corporation of America first trademarked the name Dry Ice in 1925

There is, ironically, a bit of confusion about this word.\\n\\nThe key is found, in fact, in THREE languages and one story.  Several have caught two pieces of this; none has put it together.\\n\\n1. This precise form "Babel" is simply a transliteration of the HEBRW word for the city of Babylon.  \\n\\nIn fact, this word is rendered AS "Babylon" in EVERY biblical use EXCEPT for the story of "the tower of Babel" in Genesis 11.    In other words, the expected translation in that story is actuaolly "tower of Babylon", but for other reasons (noted below) our ENGLISH translations have chosen to render it differently in just this one instance.\\n\\n2. The STORY of the tower of Babylon ("Babel") is about God's CONFUSING the languages of the people of the earth (esp. of Mesopotamia) to prevent them from carrying out their goal to "make a name for themselves..."   It's debated whether this biblical story was meant to be a literal, complete story of 'where different languages came from' or simply an illustration of how people became divided and how, by God's oversight, these divisions thwarted their efforts to rebel against him and go their own way.  (In particular, the story may have been a mocking retelling of the various attempts of the Mesopotamians to build empires and how these faltered by human division, including the different languages of the peoples of the empire.)\\n\\nAt any rate, as a result of this story, the word "Babel" in English has come to refer more generally to 'confusion of tongues' and speech that others cannot comprehend.    The movie that has just come out is based on this story and meaning of the word  (as is clear from the movie's trailer which specifically quotes from the story of Genesis 11).\\n\\n3. The Hebrew form of the name "Babel" is borrowed from the name the city was called by in AKKADIAN (the Semitic language of Babylon itself) - "Babilu".   The Akkadians explained the name as meaning "gate [bab] of God [ilu].\\n\\nBut in the story of Genesis 11 the writer is MOCKING these claims.  In fact, the story is FILLED with Hebrew wordplays, making fun of what the people were attempting to do.    It all culminates in a new, mocking explanation of the name of the city itself as related to the HEBREW veb "balal" which means "to confuse".   Of course, the writer knew this wasn't the historical reason for the name.  The whole point was to MOCK.   One might render the key line something like "so the city is appropriately called 'Confusion'!"\\n\\n4. One more piece --most often missed.   The decision of English translators to render Hebrew "Babel" as such in JUST this one instance is no doubt based on the ENGLISH word "babble" (that is, incoherent speech or baby talk), a word attested in English as early as the 13th century [Oxford English Dictionary].    \\n\\nSince English already had this word, the reason for the decision should be obvious.  It fits so very perfectly with the point of the story!!    To the people in the story, who could not undertand each other's speech, the foreign languages of their neighbors DID sound preciesely like "babble"!    So this was just a very happy, convenient co-incidence... not anything in the Hebrew or Akkadian languages.  (It's actually rather in the spirit of the Hebrew writer playing on a word in his own language to make the main joke in the story.)

The sun's radiant heat, heats the seats, etc.  The glass allows the radiation to penetrate into the car.  However, by convection, the air heats up in the car from the hot surfaces, and then the glass prevents the heat in the air from escaping.  This is a mini model of the "green house" effect.

If you're living with your aunt, and under her roof and care, then you have a responsibility to follow her rules.  Period.
Unfortunately, you are mistaken.  Nearly all horses can run the initial 2 furlongs in 24 seconds or less, yet very few can run the last 2 furlongs in less than 24 seconds.  The pace of the race and the outcome are determined by multiple factors.  If you have a horse in a race and that horse is the "controlling speed" many times you have the winner.  If that same horse is not the "controlling speed" and gets "hooked", i.e. a horse breaks even beside it, that horse, unless he is a superior animal will not win the race.  The pace will quicken and both horses will tire mid-stretch and be beaten.  A horse coming from well off the pace will benefit by a fast pace up front, provided one single horse does not clear the field and slow the fractions down.  In other words, the faster the race is run in the early stages, the more likely a horse mid-running or closing from well back will run past them late in the race.\\nThere is NO mathematical solution, regarding acceleration, stride length that has ever stood the test of time. \\nHence, IF the "fastest" horse always won, the favorites would win 100% of the time.  Industry wide, the "fastest/betting favorite" only wins 38% of the time. That means that 62% of the time the "fastest/betting favorite" loses. \\nGood luck, but the game involves much more than mathematical equations.  There are different surfaces, multiple drugs administered, and many trainers are not even trying to win TODAY, they would much rather win later at bigger odds. \\nThat, in a nutshell, is the reality.\\nI'm a 50+ year old man who has played horses for over 35 years and numbers should only be a guide, never the rule.\\nI would be happy to further elaborate if need be. \\nGood luck to you

Hi! Well, it _is_ normal for tadpoles to have high mortality rates. After all, only a few of the hundreds of eggs will finally grow into adult frogs or toads. Some are eaten by birds, some are parasitized or just die because they were not well developed.\\nBut if it is a large enough pond, at least some tadpoles will grow normally. And remember what I said about the water (I left comments in the other question): if it is not at least partly renewed, the concentration of ammonia will rise too much.\\n\\nOh, and another thing. When they first hatch, the tadpoles still have a bit of yolk from the egg and do not feed; only after a few days they develop their horny beaks and start scraping the algae. So it might be that now they're staying closer to the bottom surface, and that's why they're less visible. \\nI'm including a link to a site that shows the developmental stages for most tadpoles. The stages are numbered from 1 to 46, but the time it takes for the entire process to be completed depends on the species and also on environmental conditions: \\nhttp://www.trentu.ca/biology/tadpole/Webstage2.htm\\n\\nTry to catch a few and see which stage they're at :-)\\n-------------\\nPS I've just read the last comment. What exactly is the "clarifier"? Tadpoles are very sensitive to chemicals, please don't add anything foreign to the water!

I think that you should back away from him. Right now, you're letting him have all the benefits of being with you, while you have to share his affections with another girl.If he really loved you than he would give up the relationship with the other girl and soley be yours. You should give him an ultimatum...either she goes or you do. You definitely deserve better than second rate...which is where he has you now. Also, you should be aware that if you do get with him he could have a secretive relationship with someone else while you two are dating just like he has done with you now.
Yes, actually there is.  What you need to do is firmly grab the head of your penis with thumb and index finger.  The lightly pull outwards for 5-10 seconds about 5 times a day.  What this does is allow the skin to stretch, also making the 3 canals of your penis that fill with blood longer, thus increasing, over time, the length and possibly girth of your penis.  Now bear in mind that you NEVER, and I repeat NEVER, want to pull too hard on your penis.  This may lead to serious damage, and may harm your penis.  Don't try and make yourself stretch an added 5 inches overnight, it's not going to happen.  This is something that will take time, but it will work, you just have to be patient.

Things that look darker when soaked absorb water. The surface tension of water brings the small particles (fibre of a cloth or sand-dust) close 2 each other. As a result the density of the wet thing increases. This causes the object 2 reflect light of a different (greater?) wavelength & the colour darkens.

the way I see it there are 4 kinds of teachers. The 2 good kind, or at least have good intentions are 1. teachers who are strict because they care about their students and want them to make something of themselves. 2. Teachers who are leniant on students because they know they're just fooling around or don't want to crush their spirit; and then the not-so-good kind, #3. The kind of teacher who is strict because they just dislike the student or the class in general and #4. the teacher who is very leniant because they really just don't care. I've had all 4 kinds throughout my life. you cant tell the difference between numbers 1 and 3 because #1 will usually seem to genuinly care about their students and will try to organize exciting things or make classes more interesting. and the difference between #2 and 4 is that number 2 wants to be the nice teacher, and show the students that they care through that. #4 Just kind of sits at their desk and plays solitaire.

There is more respect to a person dressed appropriately  and not like a hooligan dragging his pants everywhere and sweeping the floor with his trousers. \\n \\n  Reason 3: Because they were their trouser at the wasit line and not below the buttocks.\\n\\n  Reason 4: Its believed that Gays during the time of Prophet Lut (Lot) used to wear their clothes dragging it on the floor (like the trousers). So muslims dont want to do it that way.\\n\\n  Reason 5: Take the reason of gateway above mine. \\n         Thank yoou Gateway.

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is any sudden and unexplained death of an apparently healthy infant aged one month to one year.\\n\\nSIDS is a definition of exclusion and should only apply to an infant whose death is sudden and unexpected, and remains unexplained after the performance of an adequate postmortem investigation including (1) an autopsy, (2) investigation of the scene and circumstances of the death and (3) exploration of the medical history of the infant and family. Generally, but not always, the infant is found dead after having been put to sleep and exhibits no signs of having suffered. Some researchers want SIDS to be assigned only to infants of age between one month and one year because of the likely high rate of false positive diagnoses in the neonatal cases when congenital anomalies are difficult to find at autopsy and the rarity of cases after one year.\\n\\nSIDS is responsible for roughly 50 deaths per 100,000 births in the US. It is responsible for far fewer deaths than congenital disorders and disorders related to short gestation; though it becomes the leading cause of death in otherwise healthy babies after one month of age.
As stated above, "good" is relative.\\n\\nTake an inventory of your life and determine what your priorities are.  Then, methodically aim to accomplish those goals.\\n\\nFor example, to me, the "good life" is the goal of a home I build to my specifications that is handicapped accessible and totally paid for by the time I retire that can also be as economical as I can build it.  I also want enough money saved that I can do a little traveling and buy books and simple pleasures without a lot of effort.\\n\\nI don't care about Hollywood-type glamor or owning a hige home with lots of things.\\n\\nI know what I want and I have a plan to get it.  To me that is the "good life".
Different gasses in the tubes produce different colors.\\n\\nThe initial color source is the inert gas which emits a characteristic color when electricity is applied. The two most common gases are neon which emits a fiery red, and a mixture of argon and minute particles of mercury which emits a subdued blue. Clear glass allows you to see the characteristic colors emitted by the gas. Fluorescent powders may be painted or baked to the inside walls of the glass tubing and the source light is then converted into a multitude of shades such as pink, turquoise, and green. By altering the mixture of elements, subtle differences are possible. For example, white is available in a wide array of color temperatures from warm to cool. \\n\\nTubing is also produced in colored glass. Deep clear reds, blues, and greens for example produce the richly saturated colors referred to as exotic or Euro glass. Colored glass may also have a fluorescent coating which can change both the quality and color of the light.

Don't take it personally.  The national average is 8 months between jobs, whether a person was terminated, laid off, or left on their own.  Some things to take inventory of are:  How many resumes have you sent out or job applications that you have filled out?  And of those, how many resulted in an interview?  That is a good indicator of how effective you are.  If the ratio is 5 - 8 interviews to 20 resumes/apps. filled out, then that is good.  Just keep plugging along.  If it is lower than that, then you need to look at what you are doing.  Another thing is to exhaust all your resources.  Network with friends and family.  That is the number one way to find a job.

We have to understand that us Christians who live for the Lord are going through a refining process because Jesus is coming soon and we need to be as ready as possible.\\n\\nThe Lord uses ALL things to the good of those who love Him.  The problem comes in with our faith.  We need to read His word and stand on it, so that when life throws us problems, we lean on Him and let His strentgh overtake our weakness.\\n\\nSometimes it is Satan who comes to destroy and then we need to get into God's presence so that He can lead us.\\n\\nWe are never ever alone if we love God and try to follow His commandments.  We just have to trust Him.\\n\\nThe Lord is so good and He is so very PERSONAL to each one of us.  He knows our needs, our desires.  Blessed be His holy, wonderful Name.
The answer to your question is yes.\\n\\nHe has tortured, tormented and killed people throughout the OT.  He once killed some people when he was gambling with Satan.  He has joined in wars, killed animals and plants, and he allows innocent people to go to Hell and be tortured by his buddy Satan.\\n\\nAs loving as He is supposed to be, he has committed more atrocities than Hitler.  But then most people don't trouble themselves to actually read the Bible, they just say they are Christian.
Vincent Fox (Mexican president) doesn't want to do anything to discourage the human smuggling into the US because he depends on his citizens making it into the US to work and send money home to their relatives in Mexico, so the Mexican government doesn't have to look after their own citizens.

The answer isn't likely what you'd want to hear.  From the first site listed below, it is apparent that the Jet/DAO components and applications are not supported fully any longer.  That leaves you with a couple of not so good options.\\nFirst, do a file search on the internet and download a few copies.  Make a survey of the file size and get a consensus so that you are fairly sure it isn't a tampered file.  Virus scan it very thoroughly and then install it.  Second option, find and purchase an older copy of a Microsoft programming product that will have the redistributable included on the CD.  This will cost you and you should only use an obviously factory produced CD for the same reasons I advised the gyrations with the downloaded file from option one.  If you do get it and it is critical to your system, be sure and archive it in two or three places and keep the media safe, sound and separate.  The third option is to download the MDAC 2.8 package and hope that it supports enough "deprecated" calls to work with your software.  I hope that this helps you out and wish you luck.
Mill Reef (1968-1986) was a champion thoroughbred racehorse.\\n\\nHe was owned and bred in America at the Rockey Stables by Paul Mellon. He was a son of Never Bend, out of the mare Milan Mill. Sent to England in December 1969 to be trained by Ian Balding, Mill Reef won the Epsom Derby in 1971, after having come second in the 2,000 Guineas to Brigadier Gerard. Mill Reef went on the win the Eclipse Stakes one month later, and in the same month, the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot. In October, he completed an extraordinary year by winning the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.\\n\\nKept in training as a four-year old, he did not have the same level of success, despite winning the Prix Ganay at Longchamp in April 1972, and, narrowly, the Coronation Cup at Epsom. He had the virus and in August broke a foreleg while training by stepping in a hole on the ground. He was saved, however, and went to the National Stud in 1973.\\n\\nMill Reef had a very successful career as a stallion, siring among others the winners in 1978 of both the Derby, Shirley Heights, and the French Derby (Prix du Jockey Club) Acamas.

Distilled water is water that has had virtually all of its impurities removed through distillation (boiling the water and collecting the steam).\\n\\nBecause of its relative purity, some of the properties of distilled water are significantly different from those of the water most people consume and use in everyday life.\\n\\nA potentially dangerous property of distilled water is that it can be heated above its boiling point without showing the normal characteristics of boiling, called superheating. When the superheated water is disturbed or has impurities added to it, a sudden, explosive boil occurs, possibly causing serious injury to anyone near it.\\n\\n\\nOne of the reasons why you should drink filltered, spring, or drinking water over distilled water is because they contain minerals that are important for your body.

With a teacher that can teach it in a way you can understand it. Anything is very easy once you know how, but most books explain it in complicated ways so it seems complicated. \\n\\nIf you know how to add, subtract, multiply and divide, then the rest is just applying different rules to change the equations.\\n\\nI took a college calculus class twice and failed. The first thing the instructors did was take out a ti-85 calculator and we started. The third time I took the class, it was with a Janapese instructor who did not allow calculators in the class. He explained it so easy I couldn't believe it. So a good instructor is your best chance at learning math with ease.
Microeconomics (literally, very small economics) is the study of the economic behaviour of individual consumers, firms, and industries and the distribution of production and income among them. It considers individuals both as suppliers of labour and capital and as the ultimate consumers of the final product. It analyzes firms both as suppliers of products and as consumers of labour and capital.\\n\\nMicroeconomics seeks to analyze the market form or other types of mechanisms that establish relative prices amongst goods and services and/or allocates society's resources amongst their many alternative uses.\\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-economics

OK I am an atheist, but I have spent a LONG time reading up about religion so I figured I could answer this question as well as anyone else.\\n\\nI guess this question is easier to answer if you believe Genesis as being absolutely true, in which case humans haven't existed for very long (despite all the evidence I must say!) in which case there were no ancient people as the human race started with Adam and Eve, both of whom knew of the existence of God.\\n\\nIf you believe that Christianity is an man-made 'invention', as you question suggests, then it doesn't matter about those before as its just make-believe anyway! \\n\\nAs for all the Christians out there who don't believe in Creationism then you need to re-read your bible with the understanding that it is 'the word of God'.

Because all they see is the tv, nintendo or pc. Blame their parents.  Monkey see, monkey do.  If the parents are active and creative then the children will be too.  I see this in very young children.  My kid is 16 mos. and loves to watch (and chase) birds, pick flowers, throw balls, play on the swing set, and 'read'.  When she goes to the daycare for an hour while I work out she plays with the toys (what a novel idea!) while most of the other kids her age are zoned out to the boob tube.  The fact is that technology is an easier way to entertain a child while creative play sometimes takes some fresh ideas from Mom and Dad.

Not sitting too close to the televison screen was something people were worried about in the 1950s and '60s, but not so much recently. There *are* some worries about "video display terminals" (monitors), actually.\\n\\n"Virtually no one believes that under ordinary circumstances television watching poses any special danger. (Well, physically, anyway.) Prior to 1968 or so some sets emitted excessive X-rays, but that problem has now been eliminated. More recently concern has arisen about computer video display terminals (VDTs), which typically are viewed at much closer range than televisions; research is inconclusive so far but continuing. To be on the safe side some eye doctors say you shouldn't let your kids get closer than five feet to the TV screen, the room shouldn't be pitch black, etc. But the intention is to prevent eye fatigue, not eye damage."

You might be able to find it on their website.  But it is usually private information for only executives and shareholders.

And your question, joke, or riddle is?\\nIn the spirit of the documentary may I add this little scenario?\\nThe national forest is now listed as extinct, the last 20 acres were seized by a group of children led by snoop dogg and they have put up 12 ft electrified fences at all the property lines and are calling thmeselves The Free Fallers.\\nPresident Jose El Tacarorado has finally opened up the borders and is letting all the Americans back in that left when all of the manufacturers moved to Mexico and in the mass exodus out by Americans into Mexico the Mexicans swarmed into America and overthrew the Bush administration and effectively gained control of the US. See the archives for more on the Day of the Great Switcherroo\\nThe Mexican president John Smith has declared the country a polluted and foul place.Since there are no EPA or OSHA regulations there the American Manufacturers have never placed any environmental saftey or human health preventative measures against poisoning our air.\\nThe movies are now the only thing left in the society remaining of the old classics of 2001, and the new one, starring Chevy Chase, Bugs Bunny, and acloned animal that did not turn out quite like it should have is a real box office hit. The name is not out yet but with a cast lke that you know it will be an action packed special stunts event of the year! The ticket price of 567 dollars a ticket is down a little, the thatre owner siting the average allowance of most teena gers as only being 2000 dollars a week were not able to afford a ticket and popcorn at thee same time so it might help some.

The use of Zonegran (zonisamide) by pregnant women hasn't been fully studied, but there are serious concerns based on studies using animals. When it was given to pregnant mice, rats, and dogs early in pregnancy, there were high rates of fetal abnormalities, especially heart defects and skeletal malformations. After it was given to monkeys during certain stages of pregnancy, many of the fetuses died, possibly because of malformations. All of these effects occurred at doses (and blood levels in the mother) that were equivalent to the amounts used to treat epilepsy in humans, or sometimes even lower. There was also a higher rate of death among the offspring of rats who were given zonisamide late in their pregnancy. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has labeled Zonegran as "Pregnancy Category C" and recommends that women who could possibly become pregnant should use effective birth control while using Zonegran. Recognizing that seizures in the mother also may be hazardous to a fetus, however, they conclude that the risks and benefits must be weighed in considering the use of Zonegran during pregnancy. Tell your doctor right away if you are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant.
Actually lynching does not necessarily to have anything to do with hanging someone.  A lynching is violence committed by a group of people.  In SC law, 1st degree lynching is a death causing by an act of violence by a mob.  2nd degree lynching is an act of violence by a mob which does not result in death.  A mob is defined in the statute as two or more people.  1st degree lynching can result in imprisonment from five to forty years.  2nd degree lynching can result in imprisonment from three years to twenty years.  Of course, the definitions and penalties for lynching will vary from state to state.

Bees are actually most often attracted by the pattern that is created in the coloring of the flower.  The stronger the contrast between the center of the flower, and the outside of the flower, the easier it is for them to see that they should pay a visit.  You might notice, for example, that bees would be attracted to pansies that have white leaves, but have a purple center.\\nAlso, bees are attracted to sweet smelling flowers.  One of the most common white flowers, daisies, are foul smelling, and use flies to pollenate, as opposed to bees.
you should actually do bi-lateral breathing.  try breathing every 3, 5, or 7 striokes.  everyone says it is to be able to look at your competition, but it isn't.  it is so that one of your shoulders doesn't grow a lot stronger than the other.  it will kepp your muscles balanced.  my friend didn't do bi-lateral breathing, and now his stronger shoulder is pulling his spine towards it and giving him scholiosis.  so just try breathing on odd number strokes and you will soon get a hang of it.  good luck!

You know I understand that you feel like your dad works all the time and don't spend any time with you, but let be for real for a second he has to work in order to take care of you and him. Secondly everything is getting more and more expensive to live now.\\n\\nThe reason why I am telling you this is I am going through the same thing but it is with my husband of 17 years. He works all the time and have some really early leaving in the morning hours and he comes home and he is too tired to share some time with me. I too complained about it and I finally thought about it and I have to say that they have to do what they do in order for us to have a roof over our heads and food on the table.\\n\\nMy advice I can share with you is simple we both have to get over this and let them do what they do and find something for us to get into doing for ourselves. \\n\\nLike I said I truly understand but you have to take this like a trooper and let your dad be a dad! Because right now you are being selfish just like me!

Here's the answer to that... only you can answer that question. :)
The one year statute of limitations does not apply to all cases.  Make sure that your attorney does personal injury law.  There are many areas of law.  Do you have any evidence to support your claims?  Medical records, work schedules, work assignment sheets could be used to prove that there has been a substantial change in your ability to do work for that particular employer.  Some states allow up to three years for medical claims due to the outcome of the treatment not being immediately available.\\n\\nFiling for unemployment compensation should be sought; whether it is awarded or not.  This is done at state level and usually involves filling out paperwork to substantiate your claim.  Your employer will be asked to submit a statement.  This step will help to validate the reasons for your dismissal from work.\\n\\nSee resource reference:  www.merck.com  \\nExtensive loss of body functions can be devastating, causing depression and loss of self-esteem. Learning exactly what has happened and what to expect in the near and distant future helps people cope with the loss. Physical and occupational therapy (see Rehabilitation: Physical Therapy) helps preserve muscle function. Therapists teach people special techniques to help them overcome lost functions. For most people, compassionate and skilled nursing care, psychologic counseling, and emotional support from family members and close friends help. Family members may also benefit from counseling.\\n\\nPerhaps a neurosurgeon could better diagnose your condition.  A trauma spinal injury may be of several types (see source).  Your attorney should have their (doctor's) statements on file as it pertains to your particular case.  Contact organizations such as the Christopher Reeves Foundation to learn of advancements in spinal cord research.\\n\\nSome states have departments that specialize in Rehabilitation Services.  They offer training to those who qualify (and pending funding availability).  They test to determine areas of interest and types of work that you can do.  They often pay for education or training that will enable you to continue working.  Learning to do other work may enable you to continue working.  It would help prevent a sense of helplessness and depression due to lack of personal fulfillment.  If your state offers Job Service, speaking with them about Rehabilitative Services may provide a name and telephone number to get things started.\\n\\nOften physical therapy is part of spinal injury treatment.  One should be careful not to irritate the injury site or create further damage.  If disability was denied on two separate occassions, they probably feel certain of your ability to work.  They, too, may be able to refer you to services designed to help in your recovery from your injury.

Its a cliche and its a style they "want' and they think they "need" \\n\\nWomen think that they feel secure with a man in the military, when in reality, we're just another guy. Yeah we work in bigger "corporations" where we have weapons, and special traning blah bah blah, but in reality, hello? we're just men. Men are men no matter what. \\n\\nAgain, NOt all military guys are a ss holes. And not all of them are jerks. you have to be the judge of that. No way you can just judge them on their uniform. And think, "wow that guy has a lot of medals, he must be really good." Sorry it doesn't work that way. \\n\\nWomen, no offense I think in my own opinion, they just want to be flattered. Have bragging rights, yeah my bf was in the military or is in the military and he's some big guy. Kind of in those ways.

Here is an explanation from The Phrase Finder supporting the Saint Peter hypothesis:\\n\\n: : What is the origin/menaing For Pete's Sake?\\n\\n: Biblical origins. Think of St Peter. Think of the omnipresent medieval church and think of hitting your thumb with a hammer. You can't swear, else the local priests will have you up before the Bishop and the Lord alone knows what the outcome of that will be, so you exclaim, in appropriate tone of voice, "For Saint Peter's sake" and carry on erecting the shelves. This phrase was amended to "For Pete's Sake" in later, less religiously oppressive, times.\\n\\n: This is called a "minced oath," a substitution of a less offensive word.

If I got aids, first of all, I would try to determine when I contracted it and contact all the people I may have infected. I would do this by retracing my steps so to speak. Go to the last person I put myself at risk with & backtrack until I get to someone who isn't infected & that would give me an idea who I contracted it from. I would still need to contact the people from before that though, just in case someone just got lucky & didn't get it from me. It's not gonna be easy & I would need to be ready for a few black eyes because if someone came to me and told me they may have given me aids I'd be tempted to give them the biggest beating of their entire life. I know it would be hypocritical of me for having put myself at risk but it's just human nature. Other than informing people and making sure I don't infect anyone else, there's not much else I can do. I would just need to make sure I keep myself healthy because the slightest infection would make me very ill.

I think what you are saying is that because of the water claim the company is cancelling your insurance at the renewal on December 5th.    Call your agent and ask why it is being cancelled.  Was there other claims besides this claim?  When they inspected the building was it in good shape?  If the building is in bad shape the company may cancel due to the maintenance of the building.  There are numerous reasons why it could be cancelled.  Call your agent and find out why.\\n\\nThe company does have the right to cancel a policy at renewal so long as they comply with state laws and send a cancellation notice.

I believe Jesus was deeply in love with Mary. I believe the romans hid this, a better example or roman conspiracy is how they moved christmas from the summer to the winter. This no christian can hide because of the wise men follow the north star which is not visible in jerusalem during the winter. It's a known fact that they had to move christmas to coincide with another roman holiday as to avoid being killed. Do I believe that there is still a bunch of people tracing their blood line no. I think that just isn't worth it. Mary's bones would be gone by now. Returned to dust.\\n\\nthere are many conspiracies in the catholic church and since the church is the ones who put the bible together decideing what to put in or leave out then yes it is corrupt.

I'm from London and certainly remember this in my schooldays (60s/70s) though I used to shout "Fains!" or "Fains I!"\\n\\nSee the following:\\n\\n" : 'Feign Knights' is a phrase used by children in Kent, England, UK. I grew up using this phrase as did all my childhood friends. It was used whilst playing tag games and you crossed your fingers saying 'feign knights' and it meant no one could tag you, you were safe, immune from being caught in the game. I now live in Gloucestershire and they do not use this phrase here and have not even heard of it.\\n\\n: I can certainly confirm that it is used in Kent - I live there (though I am not a native) but I always thought it was spelled 'fainites': I have to confess I am not at all sure about that, as it is not often one sees it written down.\\n\\n: It was certainly not used where I grew up - my childhood being divided between the Republic of Ireland and schools in Kent and Berkshire.\\n\\n: Another peculiarly Kentish usage seems to be 'Monkey Peas' for woodlice.\\n\\n: DFG\\n\\nThere is an interesting thread on "faynights" at rootsweb.com (link below). People from the London area mostly, and some Aussies, recall variations like Faynights, Fanites, Fanelights, Vainites, Venites, etc. The most cogent explanation offered by a poster draws on the Shorter Oxford Dictionary (of which I do not have a copy)which says that the expression is from "Fains I" or "Fains it". "Fain" is taken to be a childhood slang term meaning to claim an exemption from some penalty. \\n\\nThe SOD apparently says that the etymology of "fane" is unknown, so I feel free to speculate that it may be from the archaic English word "fane" meaning a temple, shrine or sanctuary."

A fascinating history, but you haven't yet asked the question. You really can't run out of characters. Just use the Edit question/Add details option on this question to continue, and then I can edit my answer. \\nIt looks like, in addition to the question(s), some information is missing like what the braking force was, or what the cars' masses are. Put all the facts in. \\nSo far we know:\\nV1a (car 1's velocity before braking) = 20 m/s.\\nV1 (car 1's velocity before collision) is unknown.\\nV2 (car 2's velocity before collision) = 0 m/s.\\nVFinal (velocity of both cars after collision) = 10 m/s.\\nEDIT: Now we're on track. Call the mass of each car m. Working backward and using conservation of momentum, 2*m*VFinal=m*V1+m*V2, so V1 = (2*m*VFinal-m*V2)/m = 2*VFinal - V2 = 2*VFinal = 20 m/s. So car1 actually didn't do any braking! Are you sure 20 m/s was the velocity before braking?\\nI'm going to go ahead assuming the 20 m/s was after braking. Going (actually coasting) down the hill, car 1 would have picked up 25*m*g N-m of energy, but we don't know its velocity V0 at the top of the hill so we don't know its total energy at the bottom of the hill. If V0=0, its velocity would be found from the potential-to-kinetic energy of the hill: 0.5*m*v^2 = 25*m*g, so v = sqrt(50*g) = 22.14 m/s. Then the energy removed from the car by the braking =  0.5*m*22.14^2-0.5*m*20^2 = 0.5*m*(22.14^2-20^2). In the collision the car1 energy loss = 0.5*m*20^2-0.5*m*10^2, and the car2 energy gain = 0.5*m*10^2.\\nThe above assumes that the actual scenario was that car1 had zero velocity at the top of the hill and braked down to 20 m/s rather than going 20 m/s before braking. Respond with more info if these assumptions are wrong.\\n2ND EDIT: Car1 had 200,000 N-m energy before the collision  and then lost 150,000 N-m, and car2 had no energy and gained 50,000 N-m. Energy wasn't conserved in the collision. Only elastic collisions conserve energy, and if 2 cars collide and don't bounce apart it's not elastic. In fact real collisions bend metal and break things, and this converts mechanical (kinetic) energy to heat energy.

You can check out www.runnersworld.com for other info, they have advice from some current and former running stars that might help. I'm not sure if you're asking about racing or completing the 3-5k. If you want to complete the 3-5k then I'd suggest start slow and gradually increase your pace over the duration. \\nIf you're trying to race it then ...I ran crosscountry and track in college in the US and my tactic for the longer races (3km,5km and CC) was to hang with the leaders of the race as long as I could. Over time, and with specific training, I was able to keep up with the leaders and be competitive. My opinion is that trying to hang back in the early going and sprinting at the end was a bad tactic, because I was so far back I was never going to catch the leaders. Go out fast with the leaders..if you sense the pace is going too fast for you then begin to settle into the pace you can handle (but remember, the winner is the person who can handle the pain for the longest, so your handling pace should still have you in some mild discomfort). Always look ahead and see if you can pick off the runner ahead of you. Some of this depends on your goals - do you want to win, do you want a fast time, are you training enough etc. Anyway, hope this helped.

Christians know that they don't have to memorize the Holy Bible word for word, it should be interpreted and understood with the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Without that guidance, the interpretation can be as numerous as the stars in the sky and the understanding can be as wide as the universe. In other words, those who attempt to interpret it by himself without the help of the Holy Spirit can even create a different story which sometimes lead to the foundation of new christian churches. Hence, the protestants, Seventh day Adventists, the Baptists, the Mormons (Latter Day Saints) and more. Now, Born again Christians are becoming the trend. All point to the Catholic Church as a Doomsday Church. But if we try to observe, the Catholic church never ever tried to show resentment with all the negative propaganda against it. Instead, it always try to preach forgiveness and unity no matter how offensive the accusation it has faced since then.\\n\\nWhat actually opened the gate to the different Biblical versions is nothing more than the upholding of human freedom. Freedom is a very delicate but admittedly the best possession man can ever have. Absolute freedom is precious to those who understand the positve attributes of it but likewise can become a dangerous social factor to those who refuse to respect it and would otherwise abuse it instead. \\n\\nWith freedom at hand, human mind was freed from the bondage of the past. It gave him the power to think freely, speak freely, believe freely and to choose freely. It freed the human mind from fear, anger, disillusionment, mental suppression and instead encouraged it to be creative, intuitive, critical, argumentative, reasonable, resourceful and productive. Thus, it is easy to see now why people have created airplanes, ocean vessels, space shuttles etc. including the discovery of the different sect coming from the one Christian Church of Jesus Christ as the Head. Can you see now what freedom can do? But all are individually answerable to God no matter what he or she believes and practice in his or her lifetime because a religion can never save you, it can only guide you towards God but the choice will always be yours. \\n\\nI am a Roman Catholic and I believe I too has accountability towards God and whatever God decides for me at the end of time, I will wholeheartedly accept because I know I can never question Him and It is Him who alone can save me.

The balanced reaction is:\\nCaC2 + 2H2O ---> C2H2 + Ca(OH)2\\n\\nThe molar mass of CaC2 is 64 g/mol so you are starting with 0.5 moles of calcium carbide.  Since water reactions with CaC2 is a 1:2 ratio, you will need twice as much water, or 1.0 moles of water = 18 grams of water.

I'm going to forego the assumption that everyone else has made regarding the status of your marriage and simply answer your question.\\n\\nThe short answer is no, there isn't currently a way to track your wife through your Acura TL navigation system.  However, several cellular phone companies offer GPS and for $9.99/mo. you can locate a cell phone user through services such as "Family Locator" through Sprint,  "Xora", "eTrace" and other applications through Nextel; and I'm sure other carriers are offering something similar.\\n\\nAs an aside, vehicles equipped with OBDIII (On-Board Diagnostics 3) have GPS tracking systems integrated into your cars ECM which will allow government agencies to track your location, speed, and even get updated data about the condition of your car (last time you had it serviced, for example).  With this technology they will be able to issue you a speeding ticket without even seeing you, or shut-down your car remotely if you don't pay your overdue parking tickets, etc.  The latest Chevy Corvette already has it.

Not sure about KY, but in AL and most other places indictments are handed down from a grand jury who usually hear evidence regarding felonies and determine whether or not there is enough evidence/probable cause to believe the accused has committed a crime.  That would be seperate from simply not showing up for court which is a violation which carries little or no jail time.  Call the jail and see what his charge is and go from there.

Ya some people do think it's OK.  NOT ME!  Our government is a disgrace to our founding fathers and all our ancestors who died in battle for our right to sit here and discuss this issue freely.  Our government has forgotten what it is to be an American.  The care our government offers illegal immigrants is a spit in the face of my grandfathers, my widowed grandmothers and orphaned cousins.  Respect and gratitude for the sacrifices and pledges to our American Flag is almost gone.  We're turning into a country of sissy's scared of a few years of hard economical stress. Our compassion is misplaced.  I'm not afraid of the hard times we may go through if we send them all back where they came from.  My hard times are already here, an illegal stole my identity, ruined my credit and got my taxes this year.  I struggled for months to get a min. wage job and was beat out over and over again by illegals cuz I don't speak spanish and wouldn't fit in.  I don't make enough $ to buy health insurance for myself and my kid but I make too much to get health care for free.  I'm deep in debt and have not been offered a single break.  F*** this S***!  What do I have to be afraid of?  Economical set back in this country for a few years is the better sacrifice for me.  At least I'd stand a chance of living out my last years with the pension I've earned and a hope for my grand children's future.  Wow I need to catch a breath, LOL.

Real men look for the qualities in a woman, not looks. \\nBuild your confidence up first, then start from there.

I guess you want me to tell why is valentine's day celebrated. You might be aware that it is dedicated to Saint Valentine. But actually, there are more than one or two legends behind the origin of this wonderful day. Here are two of them from the History Channel Official Website. For more details, you can visit the links given as source -\\n\\nThe History of Valentine's Day\\n\\nEvery February, across the country, candy, flowers, and gifts are exchanged between loved ones, all in the name of St. Valentine. But who is this mysterious saint and why do we celebrate this holiday? The history of Valentine's Day -- and its patron saint -- is shrouded in mystery. But we do know that February has long been a month of romance. St. Valentine's Day, as we know it today, contains vestiges of both Christian and ancient Roman tradition. So, who was Saint Valentine and how did he become associated with this ancient rite? Today, the Catholic Church recognizes at least three different saints named Valentine or Valentinus, all of whom were martyred.\\n\\nOne legend contends that Valentine was a priest who served during the third century in Rome. When Emperor Claudius II decided that single men made better soldiers than those with wives and families, he outlawed marriage for young men -- his crop of potential soldiers. Valentine, realizing the injustice of the decree, defied Claudius and continued to perform marriages for young lovers in secret. When Valentine's actions were discovered, Claudius ordered that he be put to death.\\n\\nOther stories suggest that Valentine may have been killed for attempting to help Christians escape harsh Roman prisons where they were often beaten and tortured.\\n\\nAccording to one legend, Valentine actually sent the first 'valentine' greeting himself. While in prison, it is believed that Valentine fell in love with a young girl -- who may have been his jailor's daughter -- who visited him during his confinement. Before his death, it is alleged that he wrote her a letter, which he signed 'From your Valentine,' an expression that is still in use today. Although the truth behind the Valentine legends is murky, the stories certainly emphasize his appeal as a sympathetic, heroic, and, most importantly, romantic figure. It's no surprise that by the Middle Ages, Valentine was one of the most popular saints in England and France.

It depends on the test used, but many chemicals will show up as methamphetamine. Ephedra (weight loss drug that is now illegal but it's in some plants and i'm sure people can still get it), pseudoephedrine(in sudafed and many cough medicines), any kind of amphetamine (such as in a prescription weight loss or ADHD drug like desoxyn, dexadrine, adderall). I've heard of kidney disease and diabetes causing false positives. Also you don't have to be using crystal meth do be using methamphetamine, there are also powdered forms, and pills, and a lot of low grade mexican cocaine contains small amounts of methamphetamine that boost the cocaine high without the user knowing it's there. You can tell by tasting the coke, if it takes a second or two before it gets the bitter coke taste and during that time there's a bland taste you just can't figure out, it's mostly likely cut with it.
It would make more sense wouldn't it?  It's rhetoric, nothing more.  "Marriage" as an institution isn't in danger because of gay marriage in any way, shape, or form.  Just a political maneuver to play to one segment of the voters, nothing more.

Pastors get paid...They do a job for the church usually under contract. (That's why most get a house, and other stuff to boot. It's part of the pay.) So when they get old and don't want to Pastor anymore they retire...It doesn't mean they don't preach anymore it just means they don't get paid for it.\\n\\nThe rest you mentioned usually do those things just because they want to. They don't get paid and are volunteers. They have a calling and decide to serve their chuch by contributing what they can. And no they don't retire but some just quit when they don't want to do it anymore or when they find a replacement or when they die. So they, in a sense, do retire at some point in one way or another.

Finding Nemo ( after Captain Nemo) is an Academy Award-winning computer-animated film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released to theaters by Walt Disney Pictures and Buena Vista Distribution. It was released in the United States/Canada on May 30, 2003, in Australia on August 28, 2003, and in the UK on October 10, 2003. The movie is the fifth Disney/Pixar feature film and the first to be released during the summer season.\\n\\nThe movie was released on a two-disc DVD on November 4, 2003 in the United States and Canada, and in Australia on January 16, 2004. It went on to become the best selling DVD of all time at 28 million copies sold.\\n\\nFinding Nemo set a record as the highest grossing opening weekend for an animated feature, making $70 million (surpassed in 2004 by Shrek 2). It was, for a time, the highest grossing animated film of all time, eclipsing the record set by The Lion King. However, in less than four weeks of release, Shrek 2 surpassed Finding Nemo's domestic gross. By March 2004, Finding Nemo was one of the top ten highest-grossing films ever, having earned over $850 million US.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Totals\\nBudget: $90,000,000 \\nMarketing cost: $4,000,000 \\nOpening Weekend Gross (Domestic): $70,251,710 \\nTotal Domestic Grosses: $339,714,978 \\nTotal Overseas Grosses: $524,911,000 \\nTotal Worldwide Grosses: $864,625,978 \\n\\nA clown fish named Marlin living in the Great Barrier Reef looses his son, Nemo after he ventures into the open sea, despite his fathers constant warnings about many of the Ocean's dangers, is abducted by a boat, and netted up and sent to a dentist's office in Sydney. So, while Marlin ventures off to try and retrieve Nemo, Marlin meets a fish named Dory, a blue tang suffering from short-term memory loss. The companions travel a great distance, encountering various dangerous sea creatures such as sharks, anglerfish and jellyfishes, in order to rescue Nemo from the dentist's office, which is situated by the Sydney Harbor. While the two are doing this, Nemo and the other sea animals in the dentist's fish tank plot a way to returning to Sydney Harbor to live their lives free again.

To be honest, the cost of repairing them would end up around the same as buying them new - you'd find any reputable repairer would urge you not to bother, unless it was simply a minor issue (such as buttons needing to be replaced). The real cost in LCD monitors (apart from paying for the name anyway) is the cost of the screen itself. Besides the, the overall quality of LCD monitors has improved immensely even over the last 12mths, so even working you wouldn't get much for them.\\n\\nIf you are looking to replace, have a look at the BenQ screens - they've been building LCD monitors longer than almost anyone else, and thus their quality is damned good - and their prices are lower than anything else of the same quality. I know that doesn't help you with your old monitors, but it should at least than should give you an improved run this time around.

OUCH!!!  I hope this wasn't something you did recently!  I've actually been pretty fortunate in that all my injuries have been relatively minor (broken toes and fingers, the occasional broken rib), but I had an interesting experience with electricity that I'd like to share.\\n\\nI was testing a piece of RADAR equipment on a ship and was following along with the Maintenance Requirements Card.  The card said "Turn on the test equipment", which had a metal ON/OFF switch that turned out to be broken, causing 110 volts to shoot through me when I turned it on.  I bounced off the wall behind me and, somewhat dazed, looked at the card again to see if that was one of the requirements.  It didn't say anything about bouncing off the wall and, in my altered state of consciousness, I decided that the voltage on the switch couldn't be doing the test equipment any good so I reached out and switched it off...sending another jolt through me and bouncing me off the wall again!!!

Sound is made by vibrations of the air (or other medium). Vibrations are caused by many means, and a gunfire is one of them. It is called "explosion". It moves the air particles at the end of the barrel in random ways, by expulsion of the combusted gun powder gasses and by the movement of the bullet. \\n\\nThe first reason of the sound is uncontrolled expansion of gasses at the end of the barrel, that cause air particle to vibrate at various frequencies for a short time, while gasses move them apart from one antoher.\\n\\nThe second reason is the bullet breaking the sound barrier when exiting the barrel. It's average velocity is 450 m/s up to 1200 m/s. If speed of sound at 20oC and 1 atm is cca 340 m/s, it is clear that sound barrier is broken, which causes "boom".\\n\\nSo, mixture of those two sounds make sound of a gun fire.

God doesn't call us to live without sin.\\n\\nI will sin again tomorrow, several times before the day is over.\\n\\nGod calls us to make the World a better place. We do this by attempting to heal our own pride, selfishness, and brokeness every day. We do this by fighting oppression, disease, and poverty. We do this by caring and loving each other.\\n\\nEveryday we are called to bring Heaven to Earth.\\n\\nGod knows your intentions. He's more interested in saving you than condemning you.\\n\\nDon't give up on fighting sin, but take it one day at a time. Maybe you beat a particular sin today, but you won't tomorrow. He understands we're not perfect.\\n\\nIf this particular sin is especially threatening to yourself, your relationships, or to others, then do everything to fight it, but don't be dismayed by occasional loss.\\n\\nGod Bless. Love Wins.

In Earlier World cups they did try a straight knockout but most people prefer the groups and i Agree. you may get the odd match with nothing to play for but in a straight knockout you get alot of poor teams playing for draws in the hope of going thru on penalties. Just look at the European Cup in the 80's and how Red Star got all the way to the final and Won by playing for draws in each round and winning on pens. The theory is the better teams in the knockout stage won't do this, but it still happens..

As dead as a dodo \\nMeaning\\n\\nUnambiguously and unequivocally dead. \\n\\nOrigin\\n\\nThe dodo was a flightless bird somewhat like a turkey. It was native to Mauritius and the last live specimen was seen in 1681. The extinction of the species is attributed to the introduction of domestic animals to Mauritius. Mind you biologists thought that coelacanths had been extinct for 70 million years until 1938, when fishermen of South Africa were found to have been regularly catching and eating them.

Constitution Memorial Day (Japanese: 憲法記念日, Kenpō Kinen-bi) is a national holiday in Japan. It takes place on May 3 in celebration of the promulgation of the 1947 Constitution of Japan. It is a part of the collection of holidays known as Golden Week.[1]\\n\\nA holiday since the current Japanese constitution came into effect on May 3, 1947, this is the only day of the year that the National Diet Building (国会議事堂, kokkai-gijidō) is open to the public.[2] Being a day that draws its significance from the Japanese constitution, Constitution Memorial Day is often chosen as a day to reflect on the meaning of democracy and Japanese government. For instance, in 2003, a number of newspapers featured editorials regarding the constitution's embattled Article 9.[3]
Freemasons are a fraternity "men only" There is also a female version called the Eastern Star. They have three appendent bodies the York Rite, Scottish Rite, and Shriners. Masons raise money for charity providing millions of dollars a day to various charities and it costs about 8 million a day to run a Shriners hospital where a child is treated at no charge. A society of secrets rather than a secret society all our rituals are plastered all over the Internet. But our grips,keys, and tokens are kept as secret as possible in the information age. We are not devil worshipers we are your neighbors who help others and each other.

I am gay.  I knew I was gay when I was 4, though I didn't know there was even a label for it.  I was attracted to men.  I went through puberty at 8.  By 12, my sexual orientation was fully functional.  I had a wonderful childhood.  Two loving parents, as perfect a home as you can get in all respects.  I was never molested.  I was never raped.  I was never sexually abused.  I had my first ejaculation at the hand of another boy when I was 12 - he was 12.  We were equals who happened to have very strong feelings for each other.  We were textbook best friends in every other respect.  I dated girls in high school because I enjoyed their company, not because I was romantically attracted to them.  I married at 19 because that's what we are "supposed" to do.  I was married 12 years and we have 2 wonderful kids who are now adults themselves. (19 and 17).  After 12 years, we decided that we both needed the freedom to find our own paths in life and we divorced amicably.  I have been in a healthy, monogamous gay relationship ever since. My kids are well adjusted and love my partner - they call him Dad2.   I have never done drugs, don't drink alcohol, and have never had the desire to smoke. I have never been, or had the desire to, be promiscuous.  My parents were born in the early 1920's.  They are still alive and kicking with sharp minds and moderately good health.  I occasionally go out to gay clubs to dance and socialize. All in all, it's been a very good and rewarding life.  Choice?  Not likely.  At the age of 4 one hardly has enough pieces to comprehend choice, let alone make them.  It was always there - at no point did I have to make a conscious choice whether to be gay or not.  I just am.  Yes, I was married and have kids.  Just because I am gay doesn't mean the plumbing doesn't work, or that I am sterile.  Sex is simply a biological process, nothing more and nothing less.  Love, however, is deeply complicated.

The good kiss would be one that involves the right feeling and the right guy. At the beginning, it'd be nice to just suck (or gently kiss) his lips, top lip first, then bottom lip next, and up again. Once you both feel comfy and warmed up, you can try using the tongue if you're comfy.\\n\\nGive him a little hint that you wanna use your tongue by slowly opening your mouth and slowly stick ur tongue in... what I used to do was to suck on his tongue. Also try the "tongue wrestle"! Can also explore by licking around his teeth and tongue... Some additional stuff you can try are: iced/cold water (the sensation of cold lips on warm is really wow!), cordial drink, soft drink, and also... pop candies! (that popping sensation really feels like fireworks in a passionate kiss!)

Supreme Court decisions, by definition, cannot be appealed.  They are the court of last resort.  They don't call them "supreme" for nothing.  Once your case has reached the supreme court of whatever jurisdiction you may happen to live in, you're done.  If we were talking about, say, the Supreme Court of Alberta, you could theoretically appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, but as you were already there, you have exhausted your legal options.

It seems to me that the Dem's only message of late is "We hate republicans, and we disagree with the Bush administration."  That's it. They cannot agree on what they want to do to make the country better, or how they plan to fix what they consider to be problems created by the Bush administration.  Until they unify and come up with a clear plan, I doubt they'll be able to significantly increase their appeal.

While all AMD processors now support 64 bit processing, the Sempron processors are AMD's "value" line, run at somewhat lower clock speeds, and have less L2 cache on chip, making them much less expensive to manufacture while still providing very good performance. (see link 1) The AMD Athlon 64 and 64FX processors (links 2,3) run at higher clock speeds and have more L2 cache, providing excellent performance, but costing much more to make than Sempron.  Athlon 64 X2 is AMD's dual core CPU, providing more stable operation for tasks such as video editing.

The survey, released this week, points out several disparities based on lifestyle, beliefs and political persuasion:\\n\\n•Republicans are happier than Democrats. \\n•People who worship frequently are happier than those who don't. \\n•The rich are happier than the poor. \\n•Whites and Hispanics are happier than blacks. \\n•Married people are happier than the unmarried. \\n•Dog owners and cat owners rate the same. \\n•Sunbelt residents are happier than everyone else. \\n\\nAbout 45 percent of Republicans said they were very happy, compared with 30 percent of Democrats. Republicans have been happier in surveys going back to 1972, the Pew study notes. \\n\\nThe reason might seem obvious, since "Republicans tend to have more money than Democrats, and—as we've already discovered—people who have more money tend to be happier," the report states.\\n\\nBut even after adjusting for income, poor Republicans are happier than poor Democrats, and rich Republicans are happier than rich Democrats. \\n\\nWhat about religion? \\n\\nForty-three percent of people who attend religious services weekly or more say they're very happy compared to 26 percent of those who go seldom or never. The Pew analysis does not answer the question of how religion, Republicanism and happiness might be related, however.\\n\\n\\n\\nStarcameo, I pasted the entire article based on this Pew Research study on happiness which is almost 2 months old. If you assume that people who attend church more often are people of faith, then we are happier.\\n\\nGod bless.

Leins, or liens (can be spelled either way!)  Generally the escrow agent will order a payoff demand from your current lender (deed of trust) which will be paid at closing.  There is a fee for the title insurance and escrow, but if you're merely wanting to know what is currently on a property, you can either check the public records or contact a title insurer and ask for something like a "property profile".

Celiac sprue (AKA celiac disease or Gluten-Sensitive Enteropathy), is a chronic disease of the digestive tract.  It is a *genetic* disease that is characterized\\nby autoimmune damage to the mucosal lining of the small intestine when gluten is ingested.\\n\\nPeople with CS cannot tolerate gluten in any form (gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, barley and some oats).  When gluten is ingested by people with the disease, the mucosa of their intestines is damaged by an immunologically mediated inflammatory response, which results in maldigestion and malabsorption.\\n\\nSymptoms vary but can include severe gas pain, stomach pain, malodorous and oily stools and/or profuse diarrhea, and weight loss.\\n\\nBecause it is a genetic, inheritable disease, there is no true prevention.  However, there are things that can be done to help manage it, most notably, dietary changes.\\n\\nThe Celiac Sprue Association can be very helpful to those interested in or living with the disease.  You can see them online at http://www.csaceliacs.org.  Hope that helps.

I looked at your profile where you said "lost and alone". I also looked at your questions. One was on marriage and divorce and getting your heart broken and another was about why life is so disappointing. Another question was if anyone has ever thought about murder. You seem to be suffering from depression or some other mental illness. My guess is that you took an overdose of pills to kill yourself and now you have second thoughts. If this is the case, get someone to take you to the emergency room at the closest hospital or call 911. In any case, you need to see a psychiatrist asap or at least talk with your doctor who can advise you or refer you to someone in the mental health department. Depression is nothing to be ashamed of and you should seek help. Let us hear from you. God bless.

Try this Prana yama breathing exercise, focus your attention on your breathing, ascertain wether you are a upper thorax (shallow breather) or a lower thorax ( deep breather). Most people who suffer from stress and anxiety, will probably find that they are shallow breathers.\\nNow sit up straight, adjust your posture to a comfortable position and focus your attention on slowly breathing in deeply, (remember, when you fill a glass with water it fills from the bottom upwards, So should your lungs), as you continue to breathe in you should start to feel first the lower thorax expanding and then the upper thorax expanding, ( do not try to force to much air into your lungs as this may cause discomfort), hold the breath for about 4 seconds and then let your self exhale slowly. Try to achieve a breathing rate of 6 seconds inhalation and 4 seconds holding then 6 second exhalation. Do this exercise for  a few minutes or for as long as is comfortable for you.
You really should have started trying a few days ago. The best time would be about 2 days before ovulation to give the sperm time to reach the egg. Sperm are not very fast and could use the extra time especially since the egg has limited viability (24-48 hours). If you don't get pregnant this month, you may want to test next month with a predictor that gives you a day or two advanced notice. If I find the exact speed for sperm I'll modify my answer to give you a more exact idea. Good luck.

The Jazzmasters do not go on tour anymore - havent recorded an album since the 90's\\nPaul Hardcastle released some albums as the Jazzmasters in the '90s in addition to his normal output. The Jazzmasters moniker is somewhat misleading — the Jazzmasters are essentially a Hardcastle solo project featuring vocalist Helen Rogers as well as the occasional contributor like reedist Phil Todd. The first Jazzmasters album appeared in 1991, with subsequent albums coming every few years. The Jazzmasters albums explore more electronic sounds than Hardcastle's traditional output; it's not strictly dance music, but is quite lively and seemingly trendy for contemporary jazz music. The albums sold very well; however, critics were less than impressed.

It's both a sickness and an addiction (its also a sin). This can be as bad as alcoholism in some people. I suggest family counselling if you can afford it.

When you begin to exercise, the body's response is to lay down new bone in the front of the shin area.  If you begin slowly, that new bone has time to develop, and harden.  If you push beyond that slow process, the new bone begins to shatter slowly, and microscopically.  The best method to avoid this is to begin your process slowly, so that the bone continues to form, yet not be stressed.  Shin splints are the leading cause of having to back off training of young race horses.  Trainers now know that when shin splints begin (It's called shin bucking) the trick is not to lay the horse up, but to back down on the speed and the amount of work.  If the horse is laid up, the new bone is absorbed.  So the cause of shin splints in horses, as well as humans is too much work, too hard, too fast....

Careers are unique to each person and are dynamic, unfolding as a person matures. Unfortunately, turnover is high for medical assistants because of the relatively high workload and comparatively low pay raises offered. Therefore many working medical assistants will eventually elect to leave their jobs for better contracts and positions with higher potential for career advancement and pay.\\n\\nMedical assistants who gained experience on the job, are certified or registered, have met their continuing education requirements, and received additional training may be able to advance into higher positions, such as becoming a medical office manager. They may also qualify for a variety of other related administrative support positions where they work, such as the medical secretary, medical records clerk, or medical insurance billing and coding specialist. \\n\\nHowever, wherever it is that they work, their hourly wages depend on the level of experience, and often whether they are certified. \\n\\nSpecialty physicians often can afford to pay more than a family physician, because they earn more themselves. Medical assistants working in the back office (clinical areas) usually earn a little more per hour than their front office counter parts (admin/reception area). Florida medical assistants earn more than those in South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, West Virginia. It all depends... \\n\\nLearn more about this subject at

The President of the United States of America (often abbreviated to "POTUS") is the head of state of the United States. Under the U.S. Constitution, the President is also the chief executive of the federal government and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.\\n\\nBecause of the superpower status of the United States, the American President is widely considered to be the most powerful person on the earth, and is usually one of the world's best-known public figures. During the Cold War, the President was sometimes referred to as "the leader of the free world," a phrase that is still invoked today.\\n\\nPowers and Dueties of the President of the United States \\nThe President, according to the Constitution, must "take care that the laws be faithfully executed." To carry out this responsibility, the president presides over the executive branch of the federal government; a vast organization of about 4 million people, including 1 million active-duty military personnel. A President-elect will make as many as 6,000 appointments to government positions, including appointments to the federal judiciary. The Senate must consent to all judicial appointments as well as the appointments of all principal officers. The President may veto laws made by the United States Congress but cannot personally initiate laws. Congress can overturn the veto with a two-thirds majority in both houses. He is Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and may make treaties, but the Senate must confirm these. The political scientist Richard Neustadt said, "Presidential power is the power to persuade and the power to persuade is the ability to bargain". He was commenting on the fact that the President's domestically constitutional power is limited, despite the modern expectation of Presidents to have a legislative program, and successful bargaining with Congress is usually essential to Presidential success.\\n\\nas for perks well that would be Command, Salary, Service, Meting People, & Fullfillmetn of Goals Set
The first interpretation has this celebration originating as a pagan tradition in the third century. During this time hordes of hungry wolves roamed outside of Rome where shepherds kept their flocks. The God Lupercus, was said to watch over the shepherds and their flocks and keep them from the wolves. Every February the Romans celebrated a feast called Lupercalia to honor Lupercus so that no harm would come to the shepherds and their flocks. Also during Lupercalia, but in honor of the goddess Juno Februata, the names of young women were put into a box and names were drawn by lot. The boys and girls who were matched would be considered partners for the year, which began in March. This celebration continued long after wolves were a problem to Rome.\\n\\nAs Christianity became prevalent, priests attempted to replace old heathen practices. To Christianize the ancient pagan celebration of the Feast of Lubercus, the church officials changed the name to St. Valentine's Day. To give the celebration further meaning and eliminate pagan traditions, priests substituted the drawing of Saints names for the names of the girls. On St. Valentine's Day the priest placed saint's names into an urn or box. The young people then drew a name from the container. In the following year, the youth was supposed to emulate the life of the saint whose name he had drawn. \\n\\nBy the fourteenth century they reverted back to the use of girl's names. In the sixteenth century they once again tried to have saintly valentines but it was as unsuccessful as the first attempt.\\n\\nWhile it can't be proved historically, there were seven men named Valentine who were honored with feasts on February 14th. Of these men, two stories link incidents that could have given our present day meaning to St. Valentine's Day.\\n\\nOne of these men named Valentine was a priest during the reign of Emperor Claudius. Valentine was revered by the young and old, rich and poor, with people of all walks of life attending his services. At this time Emperor Claudius was heavily recruiting men to serve as soldiers for his wars without much success. The men preferred not to leave their wives, families and sweethearts to fight in foreign lands. Claudius became angry and declared that no more marriages could be performed and all engagements were cancelled.\\n\\nValentine thought this to be unfair and secretly married several couples. When Claudius found out, he threw Valentine in prison where he died. Friends of the priest retrieved his body and buried it in a churchyard in Rome.\\n\\nAnother version had St. Valentine jailed for helping Christians. While Valentine was in prison he cured a jailer's daughter of blindness. Claudius became enraged and had Valentine clubbed and beheaded on February 14, 269 A.D. \\n\\nYet another story claims that Valentine fell in love with the jailer's daughter and wrote her letters that were signed "From your Valentine."\\n\\nAll of the seven Valentines eventually evolved into one. In 496 Pope Gelasius declared the day in honor of St. Valentine. Through the centuries the Christian holiday became a time to exchange love messages and St. Valentine became the patron saint of lovers. Lovers' quarrels come under his jurisdiction and, naturally, he is the patron saint of engaged couples and of anyone wishing to marry. \\n\\n:-)

2006 U.S. immigration reform protests\\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\\nJump to: navigation, search\\nThousands gather for illegal immigrant rights rally in Nashville, Tennessee on March 29, 2006.\\nEnlarge\\nThousands gather for illegal immigrant rights rally in Nashville, Tennessee on March 29, 2006.\\n\\nIn 2006, millions of people were involved in protests over a proposed reform to existing United States immigration laws. The protests began in response to proposed legislation known as H.R. 4437, which would raise penalties for illegal immigration and classify illegal aliens and anyone who helped them enter or remain in the US as felons. As part of the wider immigration debate, most protests not only seek an overhaul of this bill, but also a path to legalization for those who have entered America illegally and fewer Immigration Services delays.\\n\\nThe largest national turnout of protests occurred on April 10, 2006, in 102 cities, and were the largest demonstrations in many years in cities such as Dallas, Texas, (estimated crowd 500,000), Chicago, Illinois, (estimated crowd 100,000), Atlanta, Georgia , (estimated 60,000), Salt Lake City, Utah, (estimated 40,000), Seattle, Washington, (estimated 30,000) and Madison, Wisconsin, (estimate 25,000). Almost all of the protests were peaceful and attracted considerable media attention, although there was also controversy over what many people considered anti-American symbolism at some of the protests. Additional protests took place on May Day and many of the protesters carried portraits of Marxist icon Che Guevara and signs mass-produced by communist organizations such as Socialist Worker and Workers World Party.

Eduardo Sotelo, a Spanish-language radio personality from Los Angeles and known by the nickname El Piolin, persuaded eleven of his counterparts from Spanish-language radio stations based in Los Angeles to also rally listeners to attend planned protests. [1] [2] [3]\\n[edit]\\n\\nRole of the Internet\\n\\nInternet community sites containing personal blogs also played a significant role in helping to "get the word out" on the dates and locations for the marches and demonstration protests. Whereas Spanish language radio concentrated on the Spanish speaking audience only, the Internet catered to Mexican-Americans and other Hispanic youths. MySpace.com in particular was seen as a significant source for attracting the youth who speak English. Because of the Internet, the various marches and demonstrations which occurred around the nation attracted more than merely the illegal aliens, immigrant advocate nonprofit organizations and churches. The Internet was directly responsible for attracting a large percentage of the English speaking Hispanic American youth.\\n[edit]\\n\\nControversy and backlash over flag symbolism and protests\\n"Stolen: Continent, since 1492": One of the many bold signs used by the Mexica Movement during the Los Angeles March of 2006 (La Gran Marcha), and the subsequent march in Dallas, Texas.\\nEnlarge\\n"Stolen: Continent, since 1492": One of the many bold signs used by the Mexica Movement during the Los Angeles March of 2006 (La Gran Marcha), and the subsequent march in Dallas, Texas.\\n\\nThe initial protests caused some controversy after a number of protesters waved Mexican and other Central American flags.

there are 2 pulse points on your arms.the wrist which known as the radial pulse and the inner side at the joint between your forarm and arm which is known as the brachial pulse. there is one at your neck andthis is the most prominent pulse point and is known as the catotid pulse.\\nat the lower part of your tummy there is one pulse point but it is very hard to feel it and it is known as the aortic pulse and usually clinicians seldom assess this pulse point. however it may become very prominent in a person with acute aortic anuerysm( a mediacal condtion where there is enlargement of aorta, a big artery in body, and this is a medical emergency)\\nthere is one pulse point at the joint between the torsal and the leg (known as the inguinal region)and this pulse point is known as the femoral pulse. at the back of the knee joint there is also a pluse point. it is known as the popliteal pulse. it is relatively harder to be felt and in orderto have a better feeling you can actually try to relax your leg and straighten and press harder with thumb at the knee join and the three fingers pressing at the pulse point.\\nthere is one pulse point at the point 2cm behind and 2cm under the ankle and it is known as the posterior tibialis pulse. the other pulse point is on foot and it is known as the dorasalis pedis pulse.all the pulse points mentioned above except forthe aortic pulse are all found at both left and right side of the body.
Women who are atrracted to women. It comes from greek. A young lady teacher (dont remmember her name) would right poems about her girl students. She either was really happy with them.... or she was just that kind of girl who liked girls. So they started calling people like her by her name (ex: Stacyians). Her name was not Stacy but again I dont remmember her name. Eventually they started to call people like her on the island she lived. It was called Lesbo. Hence the name Lesbian.

Black powder is a type of gunpowder invented in the 9th century and was practically the only known propellant and explosive until the middle of the 19th century. It has been superseded by more efficient explosives such as smokeless powders and TNT. It is still manufactured today but primarily for use in fireworks, model rocket engines, and reproductions of muzzleloading weapons\\nBlack powder consists of the granular ingredients sulphur (S), charcoal (provides carbon to the reaction) and saltpetre (saltpetre, potassium nitrate, KNO3; provides oxygen to the reaction).\\n\\nA simple, commonly cited, chemical equation for the combustion of black powder is:\\n\\n2 KNO3 + S + 3C → K2S + N2 + 3CO2 \\nA more accurate, but still simplified[1], equation is\\n\\n10 KNO3 + 3S + 8C → 2K2CO3 + 3K2SO4 + 6 CO2 + 5N2 \\nThe optimum proportions for gunpowder are: 74.64% saltpetre, 13.51% charcoal, and 11.85% sulfur (by mass). The current standard for black powder manufactured by pyrotechnicians today is 75% potassium nitrate, 15% softwood charcoal and 10% sulfur.

For me fortunately I was given another chance for it and I am able to do what I have should have done years ago.  But I know that the road I did take was much harder that just trusting my instincts and intuition.  I am glad that I still have the chance but now I can help to think that where would I have been now if I did what I was supposed to do then.  Your question was pretty broad and I am not sure if this is something that you are personally going through now, but if you are I would say follow your heart and open yourself up to what you know what is right and trust what you be live.  I know people who have not had the chance to do the things they should have done when the they had the chance and they regret it for the rest of their lives.  You don't want to fall into that category. Try not to get stick singing a shoulda coulda woulda...

The one about the guy who goes motorhoming with his wife. She goes to bed early one night and he sits beside the beautiful lake they are ptiched at, getting slowly drunk and comtemplating the beauty of his surroundings. \\nHe staggers off to bed deciding he will get up at dawn and swin naked in the lake to cure his hangover. He strips off and passes out, he wakes with a jolt the next morning and dives out of the van naked and ready to swim, slowly it dawns on him he is in a busy high street with people all around. The motorhome has stopped at a red light and that is what the jolt was. His wife packed up early knowing he was p*ssed and began the drive home leaving him to sleep off the booze. As his predicament dawns on him he runs for the Motorhome door just as the lights turn to green!\\nI have no idea if it's based on truth!

Hi there,\\n\\nI'm pretty sure that you have to have an active phone line (with verizon for instance) to be able to get verizon dsl service. You can always call verizon guys and ask about that. And then if you have to have their phone service, just opt for the cheapest option possible (I'm paying like $14.95 a month) plus same for their cheapest verizon dsl (768Kbps download/64Kbps upload). Also, with dsl you get point to point connection and your download/upload speed is always constant while with cable internet more neighbors connect your connection is getting slower because they all share the same internet 'pipe'.\\nAll best,\\nBora

As you know, Fermat's principle states that light always travels the path between points that requires the least amount of time.  Before Fermat, people believed that light always travels the shortest distance between points (Hero's principle I believe).  Hero's principle explains the law of reflection...that the angle of incidence=the angle of reflection, but it doesn't explain refraction.  As you're probably aware, refraction is the bending of light that occurs when light travels into different substances.  If Hero's princple were true, you wouldn't expect the light's path to bend.  Fermat realized that since light traveled different speeds in different substances, the path of least time would necessarily be a bent path.  Thus he came up with the idea that light always travels the path of shortest time between two points.  If you like, Fermat's principle can also be thought of as a consequence of Hamilton's principle and the therory of relativity.  I personally like to think of Hamilton's principle as a Fermatlike principle governing the motion of physical objects.  When veiwed quantum mechanically, Fermat's principle is kind of interesting...hence the other people's reference to Feynmann.

Hi,\\n\\nThe two processors use totally different CPU (processor) sockets so they are not compatible. In addition, the pinout (the input and output signals) are on different pins on the CPU. There are other reasons outside of the CPU socket and pinout such as the support chipset on the motherboard.\\n\\nThe easiest thing to do is to verify that you can not get a faster AMD CPU (if you provide more information on your motherboard - make and model #, we can see if a faster CPU will work as the cheapest solution to a new CPU and motherboard). In many cases, the problem is not the speed of the CPU (unless you are a gamer), it is the amount of memory you have, the # of processes starting up at bootup (a lot of those cute little icons in the lower right part of the screen are NOT your friends. They eat up some basic sections of memory that can cause your computer to appear bogged down.).\\n\\nGeorge
I did Princeton Review twice (never take the MCAT unless you're actually going to apply -- scores expire in two years). I like Princeton Review because they offered more classroom time than Kaplan.

Not really, men can have children much later in life than women.  Women know they only have a handful of years to have children, so they 'hear their biological clock ticking,' when they are getting close to the age when childbearing becomes difficult or impossible.  Men, on the other hand, can have children basically from puberty into their seventies and even eighties.

Ethidium bromide (EB) is an intercalating dye extensively used to induce demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) (1). Demyelination follows the disappearance of neuroglial cells, chiefly astrocytes, in the early hours of intoxication (2,3). The death of astrocytes makes a breach in the glial-limiting membrane through which Schwann cells invade the CNS and repair the lost myelin sheaths (4,5).\\n\\nNaked axons receive new myelin sheaths built by invading Schwann cells and remaining oligodendrocytes - the latter along the unaffected living tissue (2). Morphological recognition of the new sheaths is based on the thickness of the sheath and on the presence of a Schwann cell wrapping the axon and surrounded by a basal lamina associated with collagen fibers (1).\\n\\nThe peripheral nervous system (PNS) differs from the CNS in fundamental aspects, i.e., histological composition (6) and regenerating capacity (7,8). In addition, Schwann cells are considered extremely industrious (9) and highly resistant to a broad span of spontaneous and experimental injuries (10). The aim of the present study was to observe Schwann cell reaction to local single and multiple EB injections and to document peripheral nerve responses to multiple challenges with the drug in order to validate this intoxication as an experimental model of demyelination in the PNS.\\n\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nMaterial and Methods \\n\\nThirty-four adult Wistar rats of both sexes were maintained in individual polypropylene cages, with free access to ration and water. The rats were divided into five groups and submitted to intraneural EB injections (Table 1). Two animals from each group received an intraneural saline injection. Stance, gait and social behavior were recorded daily.\\n\\nDemyelination was induced by single or multiple injections of 1 µl of 0.1% EB in 0.15 M saline along 8 mm on the middle third of the left sciatic nerve. The multiple injections were made at 28-day intervals. All injections were made with a Hamilton syringe and the animals were anesthetized with fentanyl/hypnomidate (Johnson & Johnson, São José dos Campos, SP, Brazil). The localization of the lesions was facilitated by a stitch in the adjacent semitendinous muscle.\\n\\nThe rats were sacrificed by an ether overdose and samples of the sciatic nerves were removed. The samples were collected 7 and 15 days after injection from the rats that received a single injection (group 1), and 10 days after injection from the rats submitted to multiple injections.\\n\\nThe samples were cut into three transverse fragments for light and transmission electron microscopy studies. All samples were washed with PBS, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer for 48 h, post-fixed in osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions, and embedded in Epon 812 resin. Semi-thin sections were obtained with a Reichert Super Nova ultramicrotome with glass knives, stained with methylene blue and observed under a Meiji 2000 light microscope. Thin sections were made with diamond knives, stained with uranyl and lead salts and studied under an EM10 Zeiss transmission electron microscope operated at 60-80 kV.\\n\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nResults \\n\\nThe rats injected with EB did not show any changes in either stance or gait during the experiment.\\n\\nThe localization of the lesions was facilitated by the stitch on the adjacent semitendinous muscle although a mild thickening of the epineurium was visible to the naked eye. This thickening was due to collagen proliferation observed in all lesions. Although some variation was detected, most of the lesions were 5-8 mm in length. All lesions showed segmental demyelination and extensive remyelination by Schwann cells.\\n\\nAfter intraneural injection of EB, Schwann cells showed signs of intoxication with a vacuolated cytoplasm and rejection of the mye

It is part of the duty of citizenship to communicate with our elected officials to give them our opinion.  They may not take the advice (and they are doing for us as they consider proper) but sometimes maybe a constituent can provide information the official may need to help with a decision.  I agree the system is hurting.  The best answer for a third party (and I am interested in groups like  the Constitution Party) is to start with some local elections and build from there.  They don't have the juice to make it on the national stage yet, I fear.

Rhythmic muscle contractions occur in the outer third of the vagina, the uterus and anus. The first muscle contractions are the most intense, and occur at a rate of about 1 per second. As the orgasm continues, the contractions become less intense and occur at a more random rate. \\n\\nA mild orgasm may have 3 -5 contractions, an intense orgasm 10 -15.\\n\\nThe "sex flush" (redness) becomes even more pronounced and may cover a greater percentage of the body.\\n\\nMuscles throughout the body may contract during orgasm, not just those in the pelvic area.\\n\\nSome women will emit or spray some fluid from their urethra during orgasm. This is often called female ejaculation. \\n\\nA woman's facial expression may indicate that she is in pain when she is having a pleasurable orgasm.\\n\\nAt the peak of orgasm the entire body may become momentarily rigid.
I've seen this happen with some viruses...\\n\\nI would run some free virus scanners just to make sure that you've caught and cleaned everything on your computer.  AVG is a free AV software product or you can download and install which will provide "real-time" protection of your computer.  There are also some free online scans such as the one at TrendMicro: http://housecall.antivirus.com.\\n\\nIf running those scans doesn't restore your IE settings, you might need to reinstall the software.  There is a new version of IE available (version 7) from the Microsoft web site.

A summary of Catholic beliefs is contained in the Nicene Creed (from the year 325): \\n\\nWe believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all that is seen and unseen. \\n\\nWe believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, one in being with the Father. Through Him all things were made. For us men and our salvation He came down from heaven: by the power of the Holy Spirit, He was born of the Virgin Mary , and became man. For our sake He was crucified under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, died, and was buried. On the third day He rose again in fulfillment of the scriptures: He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end. \\n\\nWe believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son. With the Father and the Son, He is worshiped and glorified. He has spoken through the Prophets. We believe in one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.\\n\\nFor a complete description of what Catholics believe, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/index.htm\\n\\nWith love in Christ.

I say 9 months before, you want to make sure that you have chosen the right friends and family as your bridesmaids. You dont want to chose them too early in case of a disagreement or fallout.\\n\\nIm planning on a June 2008 wedding too, and I have decided on most of the bridal party and only 4 of my friends know (life long also) and I am having doubts on one, so I want to wait and ask.Plus since they already know, they are constantly talking about the wedding and not everyone knows. Then I have 2 of my friends already fighting for maid of honor!\\n\\nMake sure to give them enough time to save $ and lose 5lbs if necessary, holidays are coming and some of us eat too much pie = ) So I think 9 months is good. Im coming out in a wedding in July and I was just told, and it gives me enough time to save money and lose some holiday weight.\\n\\n*Goodluck!*
you don't say if you're in US or UK or somewhere else - your choices depend on that. In UK you will not be able to get into forensic work without a specialist degree, probably doctorate level, whereas in the US I understand that you can.\\nWhat about some sort of environmental chemistry work? That at least uses your degree and gets you outdoors, too...monitoring etc obviously needs to take place outside!\\nA chemistry degree should show employers that you are numerate so there are many avenues of employment open. My students often go on to work in teaching, lab management, sales, hospital and other labs, chemical production and analysis, environmental monitoring etc but have also gone into actuarial work, statistical analysis and even working in science centres.\\nGood luck!
First, we notice that there is a common factor of 2a² in each term, so we pull that out of the equation to get:\\n\\n2a² (a² - 9)\\n\\nThen we can see that the part in the brackets is actually a difference of squares. So we use the difference of squares rule\\n(x² - y²) = (x-y)(x+y) to factor the part inside the brackets. We obtain:\\n\\n2a² (a - 3)(a + 3)

they can't be trained, or prodded, my dear. Has to come from within, when they realize it's the right thing to do. I'm not talking about fawning over the girl and kissing her feet to do everything she pleases; I'm talking about actually listening to her and knowing what she likes and doesn't, what she'd want to try. For example: I knew a girl who wanted to try Indian food.  she mentioned this once; so without saying a thing before, next time we went to dinner, we tried one. She instantly remembered telling me - mucho points for Eli! So be patient - or look for a guy who actually listens to you! - Eli

Yes, I do think he's going to hell. He violated the first commandment amoung other things. He said God appointed him as president, thats the kind of attitude our forefathers fought against and created this country. He's stolen from the American people, another commandment, he's lied, and accused others unjustly-another commandment. He says saddam should be prosecuted because he committed crimes against humanity? I think Bush should be prosecuted for the same thing! We went after hussien because he was easier to capture, and Bush had a personal vendetta against the Iraqui dictator. All he cares about are the rich, and could care less about the poor. He makes generalities that only the rich could live up to. The poor don't have money, how are they supposed live? The rich have money, and money makes George Bush's world go around. He said the proudest moment in his presidency was when he caught a fish! A FISH! Can u believe it? Ok, I could blab on forever, so I'll stop, u got my answer.

I've been in the clinic for 3 1/2 years and I've been detoxing for a while now.  Don't do it to fast it can be really dangerous.  Try going down the way I am, I drop down 2 mgs every other day for three weeks, then I take a break for two weeks.  That way its not such a shock to your body.  This has worked great for me and I've had 14 friends get off methadone and stay off this way.   You could also call a doctor or a drug help line(you don't have to tell them your name).  I don't know if they could help but it would be worth a try.  Good Luck!!!  If all else fails maybe you could try the program.  But I would try on my own first if I were you, just be careful.  If you start to feel bad you can always go back up for a few days.
OK, the answer is very long winded, its been a while since I done some Eigen Vectors, but to help you to bring you upto speed look at the links.\\n\\nNow in terms of Engineering, these are very important to us and are used to find out stability problems, and solve mechanical systems. In terms of facial recognition, I think fuzzy logic is usually used if not AI, as for using Eigen Vectors, I'm not sure, I suspect that one would take an image of the face and then break it up into small pixels, i.e. place a grid on top of the face, then try pattern matching methods to find a match of the face, or try and find the ratios of distances between eyes and other fixed features.\\n\\nI'm sorry that its not much help, but its a very hard question, but check out the sites\\n\\nI hope that Helps\\n\\nAnhar Hussain Miah

Well, how about using birth control like we are allowed to do?  Condoms are allowed.  God cares about our health, which is why he prohibited us from drinking and eating certain things.  For example, a woman just has a baby.  Right away, she gets pregnant again and that baby is born sickly and has many problems.  Right after that baby, another is born with even more problems.  Islam says we can not harm one another and we can not harm ourselves.  Women need time to recover from childbirth, and it's in the best interest of the next child so that it will be healthy and strong.  The mother also needs to get her strength back.  So, islamically, condoms are allowed.\\n\\nIf you are HIV positive, I think you should tell your spouse and get a divorce.  Don't take the chance of passing this on to him/her or your children.  Just think about them, care about them, think about their future and leave.

Egg shell color is caused by pigment deposition during egg formation in the oviduct and can vary according to breed, from the more common white and brown to pink or speckled blue-green. Although there is no significant link between shell color and nutritional value, there is often a cultural preference for one color over another. For example, in most regions of the United States, eggs are generally white; while in the northeast of that country and in the United Kingdom, eggs are generally light-brown. These habits may be associated with perceptions of greater purity in white-shelled eggs or greater wholesomeness in brown-shelled eggs.
The female hyena is for a fact larger than the male. The females have been conidered hermaphroditic by scientists but they are the only ones that can get pregnant. Females run around 175 pounds males about 120-150. Hyenas are ofcourse mammals.

If you get a flu shot, you are getting viral particles that have been raised in chicken eggs and inactivated by treatment with formalin.\\n\\nIf you got the flu mist thing, you get a weakened virus of some sort.\\n\\nAnyhow, you can feel like garbage after getting the shot because you are experiencing an immune reaction to what was injected (that's the point!), as your body recognizes that something is there that shouldn't be.  You don't get the flu because the viral particles are unable to do anything because the of the formalin treatment.  This year my arm hurt for an hour or so, but that was all.

Lieberman is NOW an independent or an "unaffiliated" member of the senate, meaning he doesn't belong to any recognized party.  There for, in order to determine the senate majority and which party has control, he has to caucus with one side or the other, either the republicans or democrats (He really doesn't have to, but with only one other independent in the senate, HE HAS TO!) And sense he is a liberal and former democrat he will caucus with the dems.
actually, length isnt that big of an issue. anything past 5 or 6 is just wasted length because we cant feel any extra length in there because of nerves ending or something like that. So 6 inches is just dandy but it definately doesnt need to be any longer if that's what you're thinking lol. Width on the other hand... well that's a different story entirely lol

The manager defines the tactics of the team, decides which players to play in every game, and decides which player the team should buy (Generally). However, in Italy, it is the director of football of the team that has the authority to decide which player the team should buy (after listening to the manager's opinion). \\nThe Coach(es) is a subordinate of the manager. They are assigned to train the players on their physical ability and skills.\\nThe manager doesn't deal with business matter such as merchandising, ticket price, etc. That is the job of the board of director or General Manager.

After a loss, it sure doesn't seem like it.  Nonetheless, love is one of the best parts of the human experience.  You must also remember that having lost what might have seemed your true love doesn't mean that you will never love again.  Those with such a capacity for love do find love again, and love with the one who really is your one true love.
Its not easy as you will need to obtain a queen ant before you can start the colony. Making the nest is easy just a perspex box with soil in, make it about 3 inch wide but it needs to be big, they will make there own channels & you can see them in the box living there life.Plus you need a food source. Depends on what type of ants you gets, Ants can be herbivores & Carnivores.So best to try & get leaf cutter ants or something.

Research has proven that suppliments probably do little if any good. If you want instant weight gain, use Creatine...will add about 5 pounds of water to the average person, wets the muscles and helps them heal. Other than that, IF you get a good diet, suppliments are pretty much a waste of your money. Regardless of all the hype you see, old fashioned hard work and a good balanced diet is the only way it is going to happen. You do NOT want to put on fat, so stick with a good diet of meat, carbs, oils, in all, a balanced diet. There will be plenty who tell you >>>protein shakes, protein bars, etc...waste of money, period. But if it makes you feel like you are doing something, then do what ever you want. Good luck

Steve JOBS\\n\\nJobs worked at Apple for several years with an annual salary of $1, and this earned him a listing in Guinness World Records as the "Lowest Paid Chief Executive Officer". At the 2000 keynote speech of Macworld Expo in San Francisco, the company dropped the "interim" from his title. His current salary at Apple officially remains $1 per year, although he has traditionally been the recipient of a number of lucrative "executive gifts" from the board, including a $90 million jet in 1999, and just under 30 million shares of restricted stock in 2000-2002. As such, Jobs is well compensated for his efforts at Apple despite the nominal one-dollar salary.

Your question is a very common one. Naturally everyone wants true wholesale pricing but the answer really depends on how much business potential you can offer to the wholesaler or distributor. You can only get wholesale pricing (legitimate) with a business license and/or Tax ID to show that you are a reseller. If they don't ask for the form(s), I can assure you they are not legitimate. You can find directories of wholesalers at your local library... they are a little too expensive to buiy on your own. Try to find some that will work with you as a small business but remember these places are bombarded with requests to buy products at wholesale pricing and they won't do it for a few of this and a couple of that. It's got to be a win-win situation for you and the wholesaler so sharpen your presentation and ask for a break to get your business running.

Sounds like the secretary may have committed criminal impropriety if the student is under the age 18 (16 in some states). This should be handled by law enforcement. As for suing an employee of a civil service employer, usually the answer is NO. \\n\\nBased on what you said, you could try and sue the School board.\\n\\nState laws vary so the information you provided wasn't clear enough. I would consult an attorney in your state on this issue.\\n\\nIf the child is over 18, no crime would be committed.
Assessment! If a teacher sees that a student is having difficulty in a particular area it is their responsibility to figure out why. Test the student in the area of need and analyze the results (look for a pattern). Then give the student some direct instruction in the area of need. Try to use different modalities (visual, auditory, kinesthetic etc..) to teach the student what they need to know. Then re-test and see if there is any improvement. If there is keep doing what you are doing. If not try something  different. \\n\\nRemember "If students are not learning the way you teach, teach the way they learn." :)

My sophomore year of high school, that year's valedictorian gave a graduation speech I will never forget. \\n\\nAt my high school, we had an "intruder alarm". If there was an intruder in the school, a secretary would go over the intercom and announce "Mr. principle, would you please take the Red stapler to the whatever hallway?" Well, he got up on stage and the very first thing he did was hold up a red stapler and say "Mr. Principal, I've found your red stapler."\\n\\nHe then went on to impersonated just about every teacher in the school, which is quite a feat, considering our school had nearly 60 teachers, if not more...\\n\\nFinally he tied it all in saying that his time at the school had been a time where he had grown, made friends, and was prepared to move on in his life. \\n\\nIt really was one of the best valedictorian speeches I'd ever heard.

You will need to use integration by parts.\\nLet u = x^2 and dv = sin(ax)dx, then\\ndu = 2x dx and v = (-1/a)cos(ax)\\nuv - integral(v du)\\n= (-1/a)x^2 cos(ax) + integral [ (2/a)x cos(ax) dx]\\nNow to integrate (2/a) cos(ax) dx, we need to use integration by parts one more time.\\nLet u = (2/a)x and dv = cos(ax) dx, then\\ndu = (2/a)x and v = (1/a)sin(ax)\\nuv - integral(v du)\\n= (2/a^2)x sin(ax) - integral [ (2/a^2)sin(ax) dx]\\n= (2/a^2)x sin(ax) - (2/a^2)(-1/a)cos(ax) + C\\n= (2/a^2)x sin(ax) + (2/a^3)cos(ax) + C\\nNow you need to put this with the first part to get your final answer.\\nAnswer: (-1/a)x^2 cos(ax) + (2/a^2)x sin(ax) + (2/a^3)cos(ax) + C
reliance money franchisee. He says that the Rs.12 per transaction is charged only for non internet transactions, where the clients go to the brokers office and trade. For transaction done thro internet this 12 rs. does not apply. The 500 rs. prepaid coupon will allow an intraday volume of 1 crore.\\n\\nReliance strategy is to gain max. marketshare within few months of launching. There is gonna be a big price war in the near future. It can only get better for investors, from here on. \\n\\nReliance money does not have an account with RBI.\\nFor Rs 500 one can get trading worth Rs 1.00 Cr.\\nNow what it will cost to Reliance Money:\\nRM has to pay Rs 400 per Cr to NSE as transaction charges a part of which which goes into Settlement Guarantee Fund. RM has to pay Rs 20 per cr to SEBI.\\nI am not clear weather this includes STT ,State stamp Duty & Service tax.\\nWhat about Demat Charges ? What they are going to charge is not available.\\nLets deem that this is not included.\\nNow this leaves Rs 80 per cr with Reliance Money.\\n\\nCan they survive with this amount ?\\nWhat innocent investors are not understanding is that these are tactics to attract investors from their traditional brokers & later raise their tariff.\\n\\nReliance communication is master in this. They recently have a card costing Rs 180 by which U can send 18,000 SMS. When U are hooked to SMS, they suddenly withdraw this coupon.\\n\\nPlease ask your franchisee friend can they guarantee this tariff for 3 years ?\\nThey cannot !\\nFurther with one card you cannot sell or buy even in your wife's account.\\n\\nNow if U have 4 demat  account in your family, you have to spend rs 2000/- on buying 4 cards. Can U trade Rs 4 Cr in one month.\\n\\nLastly Reliance Money is at par with all the brokers as far as charges are concerned.\\nThis is courtsey SEBI who levied uniform fee of Rs 20 per crore on all, recently,  instead of .01% for new broker for first 5 years & only Rs 5000 for 5 years thereafter irrespective of volume. THis is same fees for which two years back brokers have to cough up more than Rs 500 Cr to SEBI after they lost a case in Supreme court.

There are only two things that make anything manufactured of high quality or low quality.\\n      First is the material used. Top quality material will make a better product than low quality. Next is the workmanship that goes into its manufacture.\\n      Price, which usually has little to do with quality is determined by the pricing policy of the manufacturer and the amount of advertising that goes into its selling.\\n      A well known brand name is no guarantee of quality. It is a guarantee that the company has poured gobs of money into making itself known.\\n      Learn to judge material. Know what is best , and why it is best. Examine the workmanship, and learn the best from pretty good, from passable, or poor.\\n      If you buy by label, you're not necessarily getting your money's worth.

You should study macroeconomics to become better informed about macroeconomics, especially if you plan on becoming an economist, accountant, banker.
If you can answer (a) the rest should be easy. You can define an "effective mass" Me as the sum of the mass and inertia/r^2. This is the mass that is accelerated by m*g. Then a=m*g/Me. This can be checked by computing the forces needed for the translational and rotational accelerations; their sum should equal m*g:\\nf1=m*a\\nang.accel=a/r\\ntorque=ang.accel*I\\nf2=torque/r\\nf=f1+f2 \\nMy result was I=0.000095 kg-m^2, Me=9.3973 kg, a=0.12523 m/s^2. \\nChecking, f1=0.015027, f2=1.1618, f1+f2=m*g=1.1768
I would agree that there is a certain unfairness about having different-sized divisions, for the reasons you stated.  However, both the AL and NL have to have a even number of teams for scheduling purposes.  If things were evened out and both leagues had 15 - 3 divisions of 5 - then either there would have to be an interleague game every day, instead of at certain periods of the year, or one team in each league would have to be idle for a day or more likely 3 days at a stretch - the equivalent of scheduling a series against a null team.\\n\\nThe only ways to fix it would be to either go back to the old divisional set up - two 8-team divisions in the NL and two 7-team divisions in the AL, or expand the AL by two teams, so that both leagues have 16, and go to four 4-team divisions.
Warm air in the atmosphere tends to rise, as a result of is lower density.  Warm air is also able to hold more water vapor in it than cooler air.  As the air rises, it cools due to adiabatic expansion, until it reaches the saturation point -  the temperature at which it can no longer keep any more vapor in it.  The moisture condenses out of the air and forms the clouds.\\n\\nFor some online sources on cloud formation, check these sites.
Most geologists view crude oil, like coal and natural gas, as the product of compression and heating of ancient vegetation over geologic time scales. According to this theory, it is formed from the decayed remains of prehistoric marine animals and terrestrial plants. Over many centuries this organic matter, mixed with dried mud, is buried under thick sedimentary layers of material. The resulting high levels of heat and pressure cause the remains to metamorphose, first into a waxy material known as kerogen, and then into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons in a process known as catagenesis. These then migrate through adjacent rock layers until they become trapped underground in porous rocks called reservoirs, forming an oil field, from which the liquid can be extracted by drilling and pumping.

You have 52 choices for the first card and 51 for the second card, so it's 52*51 choices = 2652 choices\\n\\nHowever, the above answer counts the Ace of Spades, followed by the King of Spades as one choice, and the King of Spades followed by the Ace of Spades as a different choice.\\n\\nOrdinarily, we would call those two choices the same thing.  To correct for that, divide the above answer by 2 = 1326 choices.  But either answer is possible, depending on whether you wish to count a different order of the same cards as different or the same.\\n\\n(For the record, the first answer is 52 P 2, and the second answer is 52 C 2)

Almost all of the Psalms are songs. Psalms 150 speaks of using several instruments to worship - the lyre, the tambourine, trumpet, harp, strings, flute, and cymbals. The Jews used a lot of reptition in their music. God was praised by musical instruments, singing, and dancing. If these instuments were around when Psalms was written, they were surely around when Jesus came.

The Congress is made up of two parts, called houses.  The Senate is the upper house and each state has 2 senators.  The lower house of the Congress is the House of Representatives. It is larger than the Senate because the number of representatives from each state depends on the state's population and is not set at a specific number.  Each house of Congress has varying responsibility and rights.  So, in short, the Senate is just one half of the Congress.
Sometimes it like using a metaphor - it just makes the English language more bloody colourful! Sometimes, people swear because they are total morons and don't understand the swear words they are using - and it's the only way they can express their emotions. They are too stupid to have opinions, they have just emotions - usually anger and they express that anger with a tirade of obscenities. I don't mind a little colour added to the language - the odd mild swear word can help express the strength of feeling. those morons, who upset people with obscenities, they're just arseholes that should be taken out and flogged to an inch of their lives....

Advantages of Credit Cards \\n\\n\\nThere is an implicit guarantee of satisfaction with purchases because the customer is able to stop payment on a credit card account for unsatisfactory services. A number of companies guarantee all purchases over the internet. \\n\\nFree purchase points and merchandise. This is becoming more and more prevalent as credit card companies boost the amount of incentives they provide customers to apply. The more you use your card, the more points towards future purchases you get. \\n\\nFree airfare mileage points. Credit cards credit you a small percentage of each purchase towards airfare through affiliated airlines. These are like frequent flier miles. Its quite a significant incentive to charge particularly large expenditures on credit cards. \\n\\nEstablishing credit history and keeping a good credit rating. There are a number of key transactions in modern life which require a good credit rating. Getting a loan or dealing with a mortgage company is one of these. All sorts of other accounts now also include an investigation of your credit rating by the service provider. Credit cards are a perfect way to maintain a good rating. \\n\\nRe-establish credit rating after bankruptcy or other financial mishap. Those with poor credit histories or those undergoing debt consolidation or credit repair initiatives often use credit cards to repair the damnge. Secured credit cards can be used in such cases where companies are reluctant to issue unsecured credit cards. \\nAlso See: Differences Between Secured and Unsecured Credit Cards. \\n\\n\\nOn the internet, credit cards give you the advantage of comparison shopping worldwide. It is the most convenient payment option for this scenario. As ecommerce becomes more and more prevalent, this comes closer and closer to a necessity. Some companies have created services which maximize Internet technology in this regard to full effect. \\n\\nThe ability to get cash advances. This eliminates the need to go to the bank as customers can simply get the cash they need from their grocery store or other merchant. Note that credit card companies do charge a percentage of the transaction as a fee for the cash advance. But in cases of emergencies or where there is an upper limit to the credit card company's service charge, this is a good option to have. \\n\\n\\n\\nDisadvantages of Credit Cards \\n\\n\\n\\nThe temptation to aquire too many credit card accounts can lead to losing track of payment details and deadlines. This can be disastrous. It can also lead to a false sense of security where customers continually transfer accounts to new services with lower interest. This rotating form of interest, if not properly disciplined and controlled can lead to balooning payments when late payments occur. When this happens, the interest rate on even the lowest APR credit card can suddenly explode. \\n\\nDifficulty with understanding the fine print as relating to various fees and charges which may not be initially obvious. It is important to understand how the interest rates on credit card charges is calculated and it is particularly important to keep up with payments. \\n\\nDepending on the credit card company, it is possible that falling behind with payments will result in an interest charge on all future charges regardless of whether or not you settle your bill during the grace period and by the normal deadline.

From 1991 to the present day the United States Air Force and Navy have slaughtered over 200,000 civilian people in Iraq with Depleted Uranium missiles, cluster bombs, cruise missiles and other so-called “smart bombs.”\\n During the “Desert Storm” terror campaign the arsenal also included fuel-air bombs and napalm. 177 million pounds of bombs were dropped on the people of Iraq in the most concentrated aerial bombardment in the history of the world. In the 110,000 sorties of the six-week onslaught the cowardly American and British pilots (and to a lesser extent French and Saudi pilots) mass-murdered at least 200,000 people, using depleted uranium missiles, napalm, cluster-bombs, fuel-air bombs, cruise missiles and other so-called “smart bombs.” The slaughter of civilian people in the Amariyah bomb shelter was a Prime example of this American/British state terrorism. Most of them were women, children, elderly, and invalids from a new housing development. Cowardly U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force jet pilots caught one sixty-mile-long column of fleeing Iraqi soldiers and Palestinian civilian families in vehicles on the Kuwait to Basra highway - and pounded them ruthlessly with bombs and machine-gun fire. The road, clogged by four lanes of one-way, bumper-to-bumper traffic, was carpet bombed by B-52s dropping 1,000-pound bombs, and repeatedly hit with laser-guided missiles and “smart” bombs. All the Iraqi soldiers, as well as Palestinian workers and their families, were slaughtered without mercy. The bloodthirsty American pilots gleefully described the massacre as “shooting in a sheep pen.” \\n During the Desert Storm terror campaign at least 944,000 rounds of Depleted Uranium ammo were fired from American A-10 Warthogs all over Iraq and Kuwait . When a depleted uranium tipped shell strikes a tank or armoured personnel carrier it easily penetrates the armour and burns the crew alive. The impact also vaporizes the depleted uranium, creating an aerosol of radioactive heavy-metal particles which can spread as far as 190 miles on the wind. When inhaled or ingested, the depleted uranium particles cause chemical and radioactive damage to the bronchial tree, kidneys, liver and bones. Cancer often results, and the effects can even include genetic damage. \\n The Dutch Laka Foundation estimates that the United States terror campaign left behind 300-800 tons of radioactive waste from this ammunition all over Kuwait and Iraq - poisoning the air, the land, the water and the people everywhere. Afterwards, wherever the depleted uranium firing had been concentrated, there were cancer epidemics among Iraqi civilians living nearby. In the ten years since then, sanctions, polluted water and depleted uranium together have killed somewhere between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 Iraqi civilian people. At least 600,000 of the dead are children. Cancer rates have quadrupled in areas of southern Iraq bombed by the American and British state terrorists. Since it began, thousands of Iraqi babies have been born with horrible birth defects. This is something that has never before been seen in Iraq . \\n Over the course of only 43 days and nights, approximately 62,000-80,000 air-delivered cluster bombs were dropped on the Iraqi people by the American-led state terrorists. In addition, 10,000 MLRS rockets and 100,000 “Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition” artillery shells were fired. All this translates to about 24-30 million “sub munitions” or bomblets. Assuming a dud rate of 5%, it is estimated that the number of Dangerous land-mine cluster bomblets lying on or just under the surface of the ground in Iraq and Kuwait would be from 1.2 to 1.5 million. At least. In the desert, however, the percentage of these duds rose to 30%. So the number of unexploded ordnance still lying in wait for unsuspecting Iraqi children and civilian people could be as high as 7 to 9 million bomblets. A Human Rights Watch report says that of the estimated 24 to 30 mi

This is not a complete analysis, and I am not an expert in this area, and just the result of a few random thoughts. You can flesh this out as needed. \\n\\n\\nLet f(n,x)=the nth application of function g to x. In your case g(x)=sin(x). In general, a function g(x) will have some values x at which f(n,x) converges to a fixed point, and some values x at which it does not, but diverges, or exhibits periodic or chaotic behavior (wanders around in some bounded region). \\n\\nFor the case of g(x)=sin(x), \\n\\nf(1e1,1)=.463\\nf(1e2,1)=.1689\\nf(1e3,1)=.0546\\nf(1e4,1)=.0173\\nf(1e5,1)=.0055\\nf(1e6,1)=.0017\\n\\nPlotting log(f(1en,1)) versus n shows an approximately straight line, so that if a0=-1.1274 and a1=0.4303, then y(n)=a0*n+a1 is a reasonable approximation for log(f(1en,1)), and log(f(1en,1))-y(n) is \\n\\n(-0.0729, 0.0460, 0.0441, 0.0222, 0.0036, -0.0431) \\n\\nfor n=1,2,3,4,5,6 respectively. \\n\\nI notice that there appears to be some oscillatory behavior in this residual, which you might be able to model fairly accurately as well for more variance reduction in your convergence prediction. \\n\\nMaybe this will get you started and you can dig into this further, depending on how much depth you need.

Depression is a mental illness that is caused by a chemical imbalance, so thinking "happy thoughts" will not "cure" depression. It is normal to be depressed even though you have "everything", the best thing to do is, seek medical attention. People fail to realize that a mental illness is a DISEASE. For example a person who has cancer, diabetes or any other type of BODILY disease, can't just wish away their disease and neither can a person who is depressed... you just can't wish away the depression. Depression is NOTHING to be ashamed of... would any of you be ashamed if you had cancer/diabetes etc.? Don't listen to all these people who have probably never ever been depressed, seek medical attention good luck...

I do feel we are a society that has come to make excuses for everything and responsibilty falls to the waste side.  Either that or we just pass the blame along til we forget what the blame is.  If you have a clean cut case.  He killed her with a gun in the lobby.  Its simple.  He goes to jail.  Case closed.  But when it comes to the tougher issues.  He killed her with a gun in the lobby but he has been on meds since 85 for an illness he cant help and some one forgot to remind him to take it.  Thats where blame gets passed along like a basketball.  Do we blame him or blame the person who forgot to remind him to take the meds that keep him balanced.  \\nIn my honest opinion we have become a society who is weak.  We look for the easy way out.  We dont look at the source of the problem.  We assume that either the man or the caregiver of the mentally ill is responsible.  We do not look at the illness and say, how could we have helped him better before this happened.  We dont want to take the hard cases.  And so the ball keeps going around the court.
Argh...those other answers are way too complex...we don't need equations, save one: W = mg.\\n\\nNow...\\n1. weigh the empty jar with air in it (W1)\\n2. seal the air-filled jar\\n3. pump out the air to form a vacuum inside\\n4. weigh the vacuum filled jar (W0)\\n5. note the difference in weight (W1 - W0) = W; the weight (not mass) of the air you pumped out\\n6. calculate the mass = (W1 - W0)/g = W/g; where W1 is the air filled jar weight in pounds, W0 is the vacuum filled jar weight in lb, and g = 32.2 ft/sec^2.  The mass (m) unit is in slugs.\\n\\nThere will be some error because one cannot form a perfect vacuum.  But the answer you get (m = W/g) will be close enough for most purposes.
Love comes in so many shapes. \\nI love spring, because it announces the start of something new and I know that I love it, because it gives me this wonderful optimistic and happy feeling.\\nI love my partner, because he shows me that I am worthy of being loved. \\netc.\\nThere are so many things and everyone loves individually, there is no set rule on how love feels to each one of us, but when it is there, you know that it is love.

Basically Use Form W-7 to apply for an IRS individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). An is a nine-digit number issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to individuals who are required for U.S. tax purposes to have a U.S. taxpayer identification number but who do not have, and are not eligible to obtain, a social security number (SSN).\\n\\nThe ITIN is for federal tax purposes only. It does not entitle you to social security benefits and does not change your immigration status or your right to work in the United States. Also, individuals filing tax returns using an ITIN are not eligible for the earned income credit (EIC).\\nSSNs. Do not complete Form W-7 if you have an SSN or you are eligible to obtain an SSN. You are eligible for an SSN if you are a U.S. citizen or if you have been admitted by the United States for permanent residence or U.S. employment.

"Lombard Street is best known for one block on Russian Hill between Hyde and Leavenworth Streets, in which the roadway has eight sharp turns (or switchbacks) that have earned the street the distinction of being "the crookedest [most winding] street in the United States."\\n\\nThe switchback design, first suggested by property owner Carl Henry and instituted in 1922, was born out of necessity in order to reduce the hill's natural 27° slope which was too steep for most vehicles to climb and a serious hazard to pedestrians used to a more reasonable sixteen-degree incline. The speed limit is a mere 5 mph (10 km/h) on the crooked section, which is about 1/4 mile (400 m) long.

Depends on the ex.  When my children were smaller, I would send meals to my ex, because he could not cook and I wanted my children to eat well at their visitations.  Now...he is deceased, I am remarried.  Although I am a nice person, she is VERY VERY VERY nasty...I would be upset, highly upset, were he to spend holidays with her.  His AND mine have chosen to be with us, thank goodness, so I do NOT have to deal with her (she is constantly touching him and trying him).   Like I said, depends on the ex and the circumstances involved.  :(  Sorry I am not more help.  BUT....I would say that if they will not come here (as the step-children my hubby raised will not because their mama tells tales that are untrue)....I have to be honest and say that I would say NO... Stay here or go there and stay there, you cannot have it both ways, baby!   If the kids don't think enough of ME to visit just briefly, then NO.  Obviously the ex has done as this one has done....run off at the mouth and told lies that made you  a curse to the children.  'Course, you can take a quarter and my opinion and still can't make a phone call.    lol  P.S....if they are grown then, at this point, it is not even a FUNCTION of the ex's tales...it is the grown children who are being foolish and I would not stand for it, myself.  AND....I am a nice person, despite what I have said.  But I am in the same spot myself so I can feel for you...and put myself where you are.
The best and most overlooked way to improve classroom education of any kind is to introduce the use of boardgames. I have taught for over ten years all over the world, and only when I use boardgames do students voluntarily insist on extending their classes for two, three, even four hours.

The phrase 'arrow of time' refers to any process that is assymetrical w.r.t. time. I.e. the process happens in one direction and not in the other direction (or more correctly, the reverse process is exceedingly improbable).\\n\\nThe main arrow of time that we are aware of is related to the physical quantity called 'entropy' and the law of the universe that governs it, the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics.  It would take some space to describe this properly, but to summarize, 'entropy' can be thought of as the amount of disorder or randomness in a closed system (one that is not receiving heat energy from an outside source).  The 2nd Law says that the entropy (disorder or randomness) of that closed system can only go up over time.  I.e. things don't get 'less random' unless some outside energy is available to cause that order.  The 2nd Law is perhaps the most profound law of the universe, and the only one we know of that introduces a time assymetry (an arrow of time).\\n\\nThe wiki page (see Sources), provides a nice list of different concepts of the arrows of time:\\n- The thermodynamic arrow of time (entropy)\\n- The cosmological arrow of time\\n- The radiative arrow of time\\n- The causal arrow of time\\n- The weak arrow of time\\n- The quantum arrow of time\\n- The psychological/perceptual arrow of time\\n\\nIt sounds like you're interested in the cosmological arrow, and there are two possibilities:\\n\\nThe first is entropy (the thermodynamic arrow), and the idea that the entropy at the Big Bang was very low, and has slowly been increasing, and will eventually and inevitably lead to the heat death of the universe.\\n\\nThe second arrow is related to the expansion of the universe, and if gravity eventually causes the universe to stop expanding and begin contracting, the time arrow will be reversed.  The idea that the 2nd Law itself would be reversed is pretty radical.  I.e. ... that as gravity pulls everything together, things will become more and more ordered, and entropy will be *decreasing*.  \\n\\nIt's not clear how this second arrow will affect perception by intelligent beings.  It may be that we can't tell the difference ... i.e. that mental processes are bound to the thermodynamic arrow (entropy) ... so if this is reversed by the contraction of the universe, we won't know the difference and the universe will always appear (to us) to be expanding.  Maybe that's what has occurred!  :-)\\n\\nHope that helps.

Assuming you have a computer that you want to connect to the Wireless network, either right click on the wireless connection icon in the system tray or go to Start > Control Panel > Network Connections and right click on that, then click on View Available Wireless Networks, when your Network shows up (it will probably be the only one in range anyway) you will want to click Connect when you do Windows will ask you to enter the Network Key (the WEP key) two times so make sure you enter it correctly both times.  You will then be able to connect to the network.  Though, you only need this when connecting wirelessly.
You have three options.\\n1) Rent from an individual who will not run a credit/background check.  Of course if they own more than one unit (i.e. apartments instead of a house) you risk having neighbors who have done gods-only-know-what because 99% of the time the criminal background check is done with the credit check.\\n2) Go to public housing, but I thought you said no dumps....\\n3) Admit up front what the issues are and keep looking until you find a property manager who is willing to work with you.  You may be required to put down an additional deposit, but it won't be as bad as other options.  If you chose to do this option, MAKE SURE you talk to the property manager, not an assistant or a leasing agent as they are not authorized (generally speaking) to make those kinds of decisions.\\n\\nMy family was in a similar situation a few months ago but thankfully we found a community that had just emptied due to renovations and was trying to lease up again fast.  The manager was willing to work with us because she needed the occupancy.

Increasing the Minimum Wage will force employers to pay more for labor.  In response, companies find ways to reduce labor cost, usually by making more capital investment.  With new efficient machinery and equipment, companies no longer need all those employees and they start laying people off.  Unemployment rises and the economy slows down.  This has been a consistent and recuuring theme with unions and automakers.  The result is 90% of the "minimum wage" workers get raises and the other 10% get laid off.  Those 10% find it increasingly difficult to find work because all employers have found ways to produce more with fewer employees through automation.  The companies that are unable to automate (lack of funds or lack of technology) are forced out of business, creating even more employment.  The cycle repeats itself over time and the workforce gets smaller and smaller, gradually getting replaced with automation.  That is one of the reasons why the manufacturing employment in the United States has been dropping over the last 30 years while manufacting output has been rising over the same period.  If you are the one getting the raise, you are better off.  If you are the one getting laid off, you get hurt.
It's alright to keep it because it means something to you, but you should seriously think about leaving it at home. You should definately seperate yourself from it. What are you afraid of? Live your life without fear, you don't need a teddy to keep you safe.

One of the biggest things with this is that it is an american company. Because they are in mexico, the company should have some type of code of ethics policy for working outside the US. They must adhere to the norms of where the company is at however, they must also go by the organizational norms. If I were you, I would talk to the Human Resource department about the issue and if you get nowwhere with them, you can go to the to the courts or the EEO in the US might be able to help you with the problem.  http://www.eeoc.gov/

Don't worry about other people judging you. Your income and debt has nothing to do with you being irresponsible. The fact that you are trying to do something about it, that to me shows absolute responsibility. The good thing is that there are financial counselors out there who are willing to listen to your situation and make recommendations that best fit your needs. In my opinion your best option is to contact these counselors to seek out your options.\\n\\nThes programs are known as debt management programs and here's how they basically work:\\n\\n1) You have lots of high interest debt. Perhaps the high interest rates are making it very difficult for you to make any progress. So what do you do?\\n2) You call a credit couneling company. I can't speak for all companies, but the ones interested in the consumers show care and compassion because they understand you are in a difficult situation. This is sometimes all someone needs. Someone to just listen to, but if the counselor finds that a debt consolidation WILL help, then they will walk you step by step through the program. Okay so you qualify now what? \\n3) You enroll your high interest debt into the program and the company will begin contacting your creditors to negotiate lower interest rates on most of your accounts. This is a tremendous help because interest consumes most of your monthly payment anyways. Another important thing that you have to remember is that the creditors also CLOSE your accounts. This is to further help you along in paying off your debts. But what do you have to do?\\n4) You stay in contact with your consolidation company and creditors. But you only make ONE payment to the consolidation company, who in turn forward it to your creditors. Then what?\\n5) Sit back and watch your debt slowly disappear! Regardless of the debt, it typically takes a person 4-5 years to pay off your debt. As each account is paid off, your payment is then redistributed among the remaining accounts. It's a snowballing effect, where the payments to your creditors get larger as each account is paid off. \\n\\nIn choosing a company you also want to look for these things:\\n\\n1) A company who is genuinely trying to help consumers: A company who is looking for the consumer's best interests will not only counsel you, but they may take you through a budget, analyze your situation, provide free financial material, etc. In other words they don't just try to enroll you. You should never feel pressured.\\n2) A company who is non-profit, certified, and has a good track record with the BBB. A company who is non-profit may ask for a donation but it is purely voluntary. All your payments should go to your creditors. Also there are regulation agencies in place to weed out the "shady" companies, so you should make sure they are certified and a responsible member of the BBB.\\n3) A company that answers all your questions and whose counselors are also certified. You probably have lots of questions, but a caring and knowledgable counselor will walk you through step by step, and explain thoroughly every step of the process and its affects on your credit.\\n\\nThe reason I am a big fan of this method is because I myself am on a debt management program and I was once a financial counselor! My overall experience is a smooth one and it probably has something to do with the fact that I saw how the DMP (debt management program) worked behind the scenes. As far as my debt goes, in about 18 months, I have gone from $14000 debt, to about $8500. That's a big leap for me, and it's only going to get better as the payments get larger when accounts begin to close. It's a great system and more people need to take advantage of the great opportunity creditors have given consumers through the DMP. My credit score wasn't bad to begin with but it has increased from 695 to 723.\\n\\nSo if you are interested in the company I worked for, it is http://www.incharge.org . It is based in Orlan
Extermination camp (German: Vernichtungslager) or death camp was the term applied to a group of facilities set up by Nazi Germany during World War II for the express purpose of killing the Jews of Europe, although members of some other groups whom the Nazis wished to exterminate, such as Roma (Gypsies), Soviet prisoners of war, Poles and many others, were also killed in these camps. Prisoners at these camps were not expected to live more than 24 hours beyond arrival. This was part of what has become known as the Holocaust.
You can't expect to have your cake and eat it to. The reason you feel tempted to lie is because you're not sure what you want, so you're trying to both keep her and cheat on her in order to indulge both your sexual desire for others and your need for security. You know in your heart that that's not really fair to her. You must decide which is more important to you: the freedom to explore the dating scene or commitment to a long-term relationship with someone you earnestly care about. Both are equally valid choices, but you can't expect someone to commit to you if you can't commit to them. So you have to choose.\\n\\nI would recommend talking to a therapist about this if possible. Why do you feel like moving beyond this relationship at this time? Is it simply a matter of fading physical attraction? If so, perhaps you could honestly (but tactfully) express a concern about that and suggest a mutual diet and exercize program that you two could engage in together. Is it a matter of things having grown stagnant? Maybe you both need some time to yourselves to develop separate interests while simultaneously pursuing a few new mutual interests together as well. \\n\\nSometimes it's as simple as spicing things up a little. A couple's massage and a weekend retreat alone could give you two time to be intimate without the stress of daily life killing the mood. Try to remember what made you attracted to her in the first place. What interests do you share together? How could you rekindle that curiosity and desire again?\\n\\nIn the meantime, a little white lie about some of your doubts wouldn't hurt. In other words, don't tell the woman that you've been drooling over other women. But you should be honest about feelings you're having within the relationship, such as a need for more variety and a lack of sexual desire on your part (if that's the case). As long as you approach the issue with optimism and empathy, there are ways to be honest about your feelings without hurting her unnecessarily. If, however, you decide that you really need something else, then perhaps you should suggest a temporarily separation. But give the other method a try first.\\n\\nOf course, there are some women who have no problem with open relationships and might let you date around on the side if you were honest about it, but I suspect that this woman probably isn't like that. Most likely she will perceive your "dating around" as cheating.

most everything you listed, if not all, was already known to be there and marked by the UN and the seals were not broken.\\nnow the roadside mustard bombs you mentioned, were stolen from where they were stored(which the UN and the US already knew about and they were sealed) after there was nobody around guarding the place when we took over.  it is also thought that those IED's were made without the insurgents realizing what they were using as a munition...if that is true or not, who can really say, but areas where weapons are stored, especially the ones that we did want saddam to use or have, should have been secured! instead of running around looking for ones that weren't there.  guard the ones that you know about first! then go look for others.\\nbut to sum it up...that stuff wasn't "found" if anything it was/is proof that the UN inspections worked the first time, and would have worked the second time, since in all those years saddam could have very easily removed the seals and used the stuff.  christ, i hate defending that guy, but skewing facts is wrong.

they are very common benign tumors (the most common tumor in women) of the smooth muscle tissue in the muscular layer of the uterus. They are a celular proliferation of fusiform cells  with very low mitotic activity that usually arise in several groups.\\n\\nThey are benign, I insist, because they are well limited and have little or no mitotic activity (cell division), which isn't irregular either (the DNA does not get mutated when they divide). they may cause bleeding or discomfort, which is why the woman should go to her gyno. surgical treatment is usually completely curative and doesn't involve any loss of function (as in a histerectomy or anything).

According to sites in our Texas category, the name of Texas comes from the Indian words "teysha" or "tejas." These words mean either "hello friend" or "friendly" -- which makes sense, because Texans can be very friendly people! Early in Texas history, people from this area were called "Texians." Did you know that six different flags have flown over Texas in its history?

OK, this is open rebellion.  and a third of the angels in heaven followed him!  you've got to wonder what the problem was with a third of the angels that they would rather follow Lucifer than the Lord.  And it says that war was in Heaven and Lucifer and the angels that followed him were cast out of Heaven.\\n\\nSounds like a lot of free will to me.
The most normal is 6-4-3 or 5-4-3 DP\\n\\n6 is the 3rd baseman\\n5 is the shortstop\\n4 is the 2nd basebman\\n3 is the 1st baseman.\\n\\nSo, a 6-4-3 DP is ground ball to 3rd, throw to 2nd for force, then to 1st to complete it.\\n\\nOr sometimes there is a strike 'em out/throw him out DP's...Those are the coolest.\\n\\nThe batter strikes out (k), then the catcher throws to 2nd to catch the runner trying to steal.\\n\\nAnother cool DP is when there is a fly ball to the outfield, runner on thrid trying to score, and is thrown out at home.

Sounds like it's razor bumps from the in-grown hairs that you will most likely get from a close shave.\\n\\nIf you want to continue to get the close shave, use a depilatory.  It eliminates the usage of a razor and helps prevent razor bumps (it works for my husband).

The electromagnetic "spectrum" consists of all the different wavelengths and frequencies of electromagnetic waves. All electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light. Waves can be of high frequency and short wave-length, or of low frequency and long wave-length, or anywhere in between. The reference web site below has a nice sketch showing gamma rays as the highest frequency (shortest wave-length) waves in the spectrum, followed by x-rays with somewhat lower frequency (and somewhat longer wave-length), and ending all the way on the right wtih radio waves with the lowest frequency (and longest wave-length).\\n\\nIn the middle is the "visible" spectrum, for visible light is an electromagnetic wave, too. Within the visible spectrum, violet light has the highest frequency and the shortest wave-length, and red light has the lowest frequency and the longest wave-length. "Ultra-violet" has frequencies just a little higher than the highest visible violet frequencies, and "infra-red" has frequencies just a little lower than the lowest visible red.

Judas didn't want to do it. I always believed that Judas was chosen by Jesus to be the one who turned him in. Jesus knew he had to die and chose his friend to make it happen. He didn't betray Jesus. He was following orders. Jesus told Judas he would betray him. A lot of people see this as Jesus telling the future. I say he didn't tell him that he would betray him. He told him he had to.

That's probably not regarded as part of the civil rights era in the US.  You may want to try using different terminology.  Maybe a law library visit would help.  You could try to find what would be some of the earliest lawsuits aimed at enforcing federal civil rights legislation that was put in place during the civil rights era.  Human Rights Watch may also have some information although I don't know if they are concerned with anything that far in the past.  Good luck.

No it's needed for any perscription.  Also for Class II narcotics some states require registering with the state, and that also creates a state number.  ie In TX a perscription for demeraol (sp) requires a triplicate form, and in order to do these the doctor must register with the state.  \\n\\nNow this doesn't mean you can "demand" a DEA number from a doctor for any reason, but if you're getting a perscription they'll have to give it out.
I think the scientific jury is still out on that one, but in my unscientific opinion, the answer is obvious: as the human male brain developed and evolved, so did its sense of beauty which began to include women, and women without facial hair just began to look more beautiful to men than those with it.\\n\\nIt was and is just one more way to differentiate women from men so to allow the 2 sexes to be attracted to each other.\\n\\nThat's why homosexuality is so unnatural.\\n\\nThink about it, if men and women looked almost the same, what would attract us to each other?\\n\\nIt is our differences that attract the 2 sexes, not similarities.
Assuming that there is some sort of church social planned for your congregation in the near future, you have two options open.  \\n\\nThe first (and somewhat more devious) is to surreptitiously place the child on the buffet table, wrapped up like a basket of brown and serve rolls (note, it is important to do this after the food in the surrounding area has been cooked, and not in the kitchen cue).  When the banquet  is finished, and people are busily trying to snag leftovers and steal each others cookware, the brat will likely end up in the back seat of some good christians car... Problem solved.\\n\\nThe second, and somewhat more straightforward approach involves that most holy of church ceremonies...\\n\\nI am referring of course to bingo.\\n\\nBy placing the child in the winnings vault at the next bingo get  together you can not only assure that the kid will be won by a good christian individual, but that the lucky winner (having claimed the rug-rat publicly, in front of the other members of the congregation) will not be able to return said infant at a later date.
Therapeutic cloning (also known as somatic cell nuclear transfer, cell nuclear replacement, research cloning, and embryo cloning) involves taking an egg (or oocyte) from which the nucleus has been removed, and replacing that nucleus with DNA from the cell of another organism. The result is a blastocyst (an early stage embryo with about 100 cells) with almost identical DNA to the original organism.\\n\\nThe procedure is controversial, and this is reflected in the language used to describe the blastocyst created. Some people believe it should not be called a blastocyst or embryo, since it has not been created by fertilisation, but others maintain that since, given the right conditions, it could still grow into a fetus and eventually a child, it doesn't seem misleading to call it an embryo.\\nThe aim of carrying out this procedure is to obtain stem cells that are genetically matched to the donor organism. For example, if a person with Parkinson's disease donated their DNA, then it should be theoretically possible to generate embryonic stem cells that could be used to treat their condition without being rejected by the patient's immune system.

I was stationed in Berlin Germany right during the fall of the Berlin Wall and East Germany was coming out from under Communist control. There was a story of little children in an art class after communism fell and were told they could draw anything they wanted and none of them drew anything. When asked they explained that they had always been told what to draw. Also another interesting thought is that state approved car in East Germany was made of a wood frame with a plastic exterior body and a 2-cycle engine (the size that is used on your push mower).
Affirmative action is legalized discrimination.  By giving "minority" persons an unearned edge, affirmative action suggests that a "minority" person is less capable than a "non-minority" person.  By its nature, then, affirmative action is unethical.  It not only implies inferiority of "minorities", but it also forces people in authority to make unethical decisions.

Incarcaration is considered to be their punishment.  In addition, they are barred from some jobs after they are released.

Well, people who are doped up generally are not very responsible or productive workers, so if a company hired those types of people productivity would decrease. Also a doped up employee is a bad representation of the company image, and can be a liability to the company if they do something stupid to hurt themselves or their coworkers.  \\n\\nHiring druggies can lower productivity, loose customers, and pose a thretening envirnment for coworkers, all of these will cost the ompany money and productivity.
The Royal Family bring in far more in tourism revenue than is spent on them.\\n\\nI am not sure which prince you mean, Prince Phillip was in the navy and served in active service in World War II.

Prince Andrew was active in the Falklands war of 1982.\\n\\nIt could be said that some of them did not see 'combat' but ..... neither did anyone else at that time since Britain was not involved in any wars when they were in active service.\\n\\nWhat does the Queen do? She is an impartial figurehead for Britain and the Commonwealth. Unlike a president who would be partisan, the Queen stands up for all sides in the name of democracy, and she represents Britain across the world. She also does charity work and honours those who have fought wars.\\n\\nThere are anti-royalists in the United Kingdom, known as 'republicans' and there always have been. However, surveys have tended to show that most people do not support the abolition of the monarchy.

I like a girl with a nice complexion and smile, first. Then I like clean above the shoulder hair tucked just a little behind her ears. She has to have nice teeth, the whiter the better. She does not smoke, or if she does it is rarely, maybe with a beer. She drinks occasionally but does not get drunk and make a fool of herself. She has tried drugs and will not do them again because she knows herself too well to need them now. She has a nice figure, is about 5'7" tall and weighs about 120#. She has well proportioned breasts with nice nipples that she sometimes lets show through her tops. She never dresses like a slut, she dresses just a little preppie. She never has sex until she really knows somebody but when she does she likes to get on top and fuck the hell out of her man.
If you are looking for installing Windows xp without formatting, then I am not your piece of cake. But I can solve your probs. When the options menu you said occurs again, choose Safe Mode and boot. Windows xp will boot whatsoever. Then Windows xp will automatically rechange you settings to the last working configuration. If this does not work, go to start -> Acessories -> System tools ->System Restore. The comp will restore your spec as according to the date u want. If you insist on lazy methods and don't want complication, use the option 'Boot with last known good configuration'(though this menu comes when the OS gets frustrated{after several reboots}). If not all this Best REINSTALL WINDOWS XP. simple procedure, just insert the disk and it will guide you through.

The market in Taiwan is pretty well saturated at the moment if you are interested in business. You could always study business in Taiwan after your studies in the USA. This would probably ensure you find a job, and give you a better understanding of business practices there, rather than just turning up with a shiny new qualification but no idea of the culture. Why not an MBA at NTU (National Taiwan University)? It's very prestigious, and programmes are run in English and Chinese - maybe you should move there now!
If your question is the same as the other one, then there is something your friend can do.  Most "head shops" carry drinks that are specifically formulated to clean your body of any trace of marijuana.

Wish your friend luck for me.
I have found a website that compiles various resources on starting a non profit. I especially like the Minnesota Council of NonProfits because the site gives information on governance, developing strategic alliances, fund raising and other ingredients of successfully running a non profit. \\n\\nhttp://www.lib.msu.edu/harris23/grants/znpbib.htm\\n\\nAs for funding your non profit, I suggest you check out Foundation Center to help you gain ideas on how to properly establish your organization and get support from private foundations. They have the most extensive database of private donors, and they publish a magazine that can be very helpful to your new non profit.\\n\\nhttp://fdncenter.org/getstarted/tutorials/establish/index.html\\n\\nI was previously involved in the setup of a non profit, and we were able to get a pro-bono lawyer who set up everything for us, including getting the 501c3 tax status. Contact other non profits in your area and check if there are lawyers willing to work for free to get you started. \\n\\nNon profits are just like any business - you need to get the word out in order to get the needed funding to help support your activities. Here are some tips to help you market your non profit:\\n\\n1. Determine your your target audiences: who are the groups and audiences that your non profit wants to reach. Remember that one target group may respond differently to a marketing message as another group so make sure that each strategy is tailor made for each audience.\\n\\n2. Develop a communications strategy, creating timelines for marketing efforts such as newsletters, press releases, special events, and others.\\n\\n3. Develop a visual image. Prepare your logo and other branding tools - and use them consistently across various mediums. Make sure that you repeat your branding messages, slogans in everything you make from brochures to newsletters.\\n\\n4. Employ multiple communications tactics: Nonprofit organizations often target several audiences, which may respond to different approaches. Various communications campaigns can help establish and maintain a more widespread positive image.\\n\\n5. Select and use appropriate media: Plan to use a combination of approaches best suited to reaching your targeted audiences and that make best use of your financial resources. Include a variety of methods including phone calls, letters, e-mail, newsletters, PSAs, press releases, and editorials.\\n\\nFor detailed information on how to start a non profit, I suggest you read the following books:\\n\\n- Starting and Running a Nonprofit Organization -- by Joan M. Hummel\\n- Starting and Running a Non-Profit Made Easy by Entrepreneur Press, David H. Bangs\\n- Starting & Building A Nonprofit: A Practical Guide by Peri Pakroo

best way to figure it out is to reel the flyline onto the reel first then attach the backing to the flyline with a knot that will slip throught the guides easily. fill the reel to capacity with the backing then cut it. strip it all off the reel then attach the backing to the reel and wind it all in. the reel will be full with the right amount of backing.

God does tell his through his word that "no man knows the day nor the hour."  Because of this, we should live our life as if Jesus were to return today.  Even if Jesus doesn't return today, you never know when he may call you home.  Life is taken to much for granted, it can be taken away in a blink of an eye.  If that were to happen, are you ready?

Wake her up to breakfast in bed and a buch of flowers (simple breakfast is good - cereal and toast with fresh orange juice and tea/coffee) Then take a long bath or shower together, nothing needs to happen but just having that intimate time together can often bring you closer. Put some music on and talk. Have a nice relaxing day together. Followed by a meal out for tea, doesnt have to be expensive, but that way she doesnt have to cook, and you dont have to fret over trying to cook. And drinks in a quiet pub that you are both comfortable in. Taxi home of course and a snugle in bed to finish the day.
there would be no more tides around the world as the moon is the main influence on the sea and tides.
because there is very little resistance in space. objects in motion will stay in motion unless a force acts on them. since they are in space, there's not really much of a foce acting on them with one exception: gravity.\\n\\ngravity of course pulls the satellites down towards the earth. but the satellite is moving at a fairly constant velocity in a direction which is tangent to the earth. so the direction of travel is always perpendicular to the force of gravity, which means that the satellite stays in perfect orbit.\\n\\nif it used its fuel to speed up, it would overcome the earth's gravity and fly off into space. if it used its fuel to slow down, the earth's gravity would overcome the satellites speed and pull it in. orbit is the perfect middle ground between these two.\\n\\nnow if there were a bunch of air in space, then the air molecules would cause friction that would slow the satellite down. the earth's gravity would then pull it in and cause it to crash. so to overcome the air molecules, the satellite would need a constant thrust to keep it in orbit. but since there is little or no resistance in space, it doesn't need to hit its boosters at all. it just needs to get up to the perfect speed and physics will take care of the rest.\\n\\nsorry if this was unclear. it's late ;p

Below are some sample resumes for your reference:\\n\\nhttp://www.resume-resource.com/samples.html\\n\\nHere are some guidelines:\\n1. If you have less than 10 years of experience, you want your resume to be one page.\\n2. Generally, clearly show your name, mailing address, email address if available, and best phone number(s) to contact you.\\n3. Then show your education, work experience, any interests, achievements, and skill sets. Under your work experience, it is not a list of your job descriptions (this is a common mistake). You should instead indicate what you have accomplished and the results.  Use action verbs.\\n4. If you are looking for your first job or intend to change job function / industry, you may want to state your objectives.\\n4. There is no one “correct” format.  It depends on your profession and personal style.\\n5. Also, try not to use technical words and jargons. Do not abbreviate.\\n\\nYou can post your resume at:\\nhttp://www.monster.com\\nhttp://www.careerbuilder.com\\nhttp://hotjobs.yahoo.com\\n\\nI would also go to your bookstore and find a resume book in the business/career section. You can also find more examples and templates online if you do a search.\\n\\nGood luck and have a nice day.

Poison by Bel Biv Devoe
Her name is Kristina Sisco. \\nKristina, the daughter of a Navy reservist, moved four times by the time she was 12. Born in Bethesda, the Siscos moved to California and then Texas before returning to Bethesda. \\n\\nKristina started her career at age 13 working as a reporter for a local Bethesda UPN television station. Her television exposure then led to some modeling jobs and a one-time stint on America's Most Wanted. \\n\\nKristina currently resides in New Jersey with her older sister, Kennen.
America's youth have been falling victim to what they see on TV, as well as other negative media images (advertisements, video games) for the past 10-15 years.  But it's not just MTV and BET.  MTV stopped playing music back around 1990, and kids stopped watching it around 1995.  BET lost any quality programming when they were bought out by Viacom (who owns MTV) around 1996 or 1997, and black kids don't really watch BET.  The real problem is that PARENTS RELY ON THE TELEVISION TO RAISE THEIR CHILDREN FOR THEM!  Parents aren't spending any quality time teaching their kids any proper values, such as respect or manners.  Parents also aren't encouraging their childeren to either get up from the TV and go out and do things, or to pick up a book and read.  It's not the fault of television, or the schools, or the government.  If you are a parent, then these are YOUR damn kids, so the only person responsible for how they turn out is YOU.

Good for you, for wanting to help her with this process!  Too many parents would just stand back and hope she could find a way to do this.  There are several ways you can approach this.  If you have a family dentist with whom she has a good relationship, she (or you) could ask her/him for help with the process.  There are many websites, like www.collegeboard.com, which give information - she needs to prepare for the SAT, if she hasn't already taken that exam, and she should get help with her essays and financial aid applications.  Be careful, by the way, about rip-off companies which take your money and promise financial aid; I've seen too many people taken in by these sleazy people.  Once she gets accepted at a college, they should be able to work with her to get financial aid that she (and you) doesn't have to pay for up front.  The suggestion about community college counselors was a good one, and if you have any money, there are professional independent college counselors you can get advice from.  I can tell you that I'm a college professor, and many of us love it when high school students who are interested in our fields come to us for advice.  I don't know enough about the sciences, or I'd volunteer to help her myself!

As a man, I would feel flattered if a woman asked me out - assuming, of course, that I already liked her in the first place and was just too nervous to ask her.  When guys ask someone out, we're taking a big jump.  We hope you'll say yes and that the jump will have been worth it.  However, when you say no, we feel embarassed for having jumped in the first place.  When the woman asks the man out, it saves us from having to jump at all.  However, now you are taking the risk.  I think we are all afraid of being rejected, of having someone not like us.  Asking someone out and hearing the person say yes is one of the biggests leaps in this area.  But, if you already like the person, hopefully that will give you enough courage to ask.

The shoe should come pre-assembled.  You will have to mount cleats on the bottom; these will typically come with the pedals that you purchase for your bike.  You will need an allen wrench (hex key) to tighten the cleats to the base of the shoe.  Ask your bike shop if the cleats you have will fit the shoe that you have.  If not, you will need to get an adapter from the shop or manufacturer or switch to a different pedal/cleat that is compatible with your shoes.\\n\\nHope this helps!

Your wrong to some degree but so is he and so are they.  People tend to be proud of their lives and they most often express that pride to family which is you and your boyfriend.  Yes, they probably carry it too far, but I doubt if it is meant to make you feel bad.  Your boyfriend is wrong because he shouldn't be mad at you.  He should have been understanding and talked you about it.  There was no reason to be mad at you for your feelings regardless of if he believed them or not.

Electricity is the migration of free electrons form a highly negatively charged area to a positively charged area. When you rub your woolly socked feet on the wood floor and touch your your sister's ear, she gets a shock because you built up a negative charge compared to her charge level. so the electrons jumped over from you to her. These electrons can flow along any medium including air, as in Lightening. Even through space if the forces were strong enough. When you send electricity through a wire, the resistance of the wire and the wire itself absorb the free electron charge. It can go as far as the strength, or voltage, of the charge will push it against the resistance. We used to send phone messages across the oceans by wire so the longest we've done here on earth could be considered as many times the circumference of the earth. In short, there is really no limit as to how far you can transmit an electrical current. It will just take a lot more power to send it farther.
If she has pic's all over the place she either just coincidental has his last name and is just abnormally obsessed--in which case you should ask her because I'd imagine she'd be extremely excited to tell someone of her fan worshiping.

Your best bet I think is to go for private grants. You may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants. It's a subscription based website and contains listings of foundations who might be willing to support something like your project. \\n\\nYou can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your objectives.\\n\\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \\n\\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs

Proximity switches are used in industry to detect proximity of moving components. I am from aviation industry so I give example of landing gear down & locked condition sensing being done by proximity switches.The main parts of a proximity switch are the switch module & the target which do not come in contact with each other but come in close proximity. When the target comes in close proximity to the switch a signal is generated from the switch module for the appropriate circuit.\\nThere are two distinct types of proximity switches;\\nA) Magnetic type; Here the switch part of the module consists of an internal magnetically operated microswitch & the same is activated when a magnetic target comes in close proximity to it.\\nB) Solid state type; The switch module consists of a gauss generating unit. When the non-magnetic target comes in close proximity to it the internal circuit is completed & a signal is generated.

I generally do vote for another party. The Libertarian Party is the most viable 3rd party alternative. I think that most Republicans and most Democrats are just as evil as each other, maybe just in different ways, so it makes no difference to me which one is in office. To those who say I am wasting my vote I say that at least I am voting for someone I can believe in, not for a lesser of 2 evils. If more people voted for who they really wanted, we'd be better off, even if it is just sending a message to the powers that otherwise be.

Zero.  I'm being a jerk, but for an important reason.  Your question is incomplete.  You can ask two people and have a 95% confidence that the results are representative.  But your margin of error is 75 percent.  That's the part I'm being a jerk about.\\n\\nIf you're trying to predict an election, 3 or 5% is probably close enough.  But that means a 55 to 45 vote is as likely as a 45 to 55 vote.    And 3% means asking more than 800 people, 5% only 350.  If you sell extended computer warranties and need to know how often their pc breaks, a smaller error is very important.\\n\\nYou can use an online tool to calculate these figures [click below] or you can skip the Audi TT and go to graduate school to learn how to do it yourself [damn! there was an online tool?].  But this is only an estimate.  The actual figures depend on the question and consistency of the answers.

Hello,\\n\\nYou have to check for the event WM_COMMAND in your switch instruction. And inside that case, check the wParam value (High order byte) of the event to make sure it is a BN_CLICKED event. At that stage, you need to further identify your button using the wParam (Low order byte) of the wParam.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n        case WM_COMMAND: \\n          if (HIWORD(wParam) == BN_CLICKED) \\n          { \\n                switch (LOWORD(wParam)) \\n                { \\n                    case ID_OF_YOUR_BUTON: \\n                        MessageBox(hwnd, "Hello", "Testing", MB_OK);\\n \\n                        break; \\n                } \\n          } \\n          break; \\n\\n\\nI suggest that you take a look to the doc of VC++ on these events, mainly in the Windows SDK doc about Buttons. It is well done with code samples.\\n\\nAdditional note: as you created your button directly on a window instead of within a dialog box, it is very likely that you used a call to the CreateWindow function to create it. In this case, you give the ID number in parameter HMENU hMenu of the function. You may create a Resource ID (it is just an value globally defined with #define) to avoid playing with numbers when you have several controls.\\n\\nRegards,\\nChris.\\nhttp://www.beinsoft.com

Edema is an observable swelling from fluid accumulation in certain body tissues. Edema most commonly occurs in the feet and legs, where it also is referred to as peripheral edema. The swelling is the result of the accumulation of excess fluid under the skin in the spaces within the tissues that are outside of the blood vessels.\\n\\nHeart failure often causes edema. Congestive heart failure or CHF is the bunch of symptoms that hit you when your heart can't pump enough blood to satisfy your body's needs.

Could be that he doesn't like to be alone and the only way for him to not feel that way is to get married. Have you talked to him about his other two marriages? Find out why he thinks the marriages failed. How long was each marriage? How long before divorcing one wife did he marry the second one?  If he lays all of the blame on his ex wives, I would be very leery about marrying him. Remember it takes two to make and break a marriage.\\n\\nThanks for the additional information.  So, he doesn't think he was at fault for either of the other two marriages breaking up? Hmm, I would worry about that one. Also you say you have different ideas on other things, sounds like you may not be compatible. Since you have been married twice before you should know where those went wrong and hopefully learned something. Don't be in such a hurry to get married and if your boyfriend continues to rush you, let him know that you want to take it slow. If he truly loves you he will respect your wishes. I also would suggest that if you do decide to marry him to go to some type of counseling before hand. Good Luck to you.

Nice question.\\n\\nWell, neither peptic ulcer nor any medications used to treat it can cause palpitations.\\n\\nHowever, there are two weak links. \\n\\n1.   People suffering from anxiety suffer from palpitations very often. Such people are also prone to increased acid production and hence peptic ulceration. So ask yourself? Are you an anxious person?\\n\\n2.   Most people who use caffeine excessively (such as tea and cofees and soft drinks) are prone to get acid-reflux disorders including peptic ulceration. Same caffiene can also transiently cause palpitations in susceptible individuals.\\n\\nI hope that helps.

I don't feel angels in a physical sense like you do.  I feel them in a spiritual sense,  such as knowing my deceased mother is present - constantly.  She's always with me.\\n\\nI also experience angels by being one with acts of kindness.  I don't label myself and an angel.  I use instinct in dealing with people who are in distress - many times helping strangers.  \\n\\nI have also experienced angels when friends or strangers have helped me. Once, while driving an hour from home in an isolated area,  a man in another car flagged me down. I stopped. When he approached my car,  he apologized because he thought I was his wife who drove the same model and color of car as me.  He thought it was she he was trying to stop.  As he was walking back to his car, he stopped by my front  and took a look.  He came back and told me it was in shreds and that it needed immediate attention.  He said that it could blow at any minute and possibly cause an accident.  He then told me where the next service stations was where I could buy a new tire - sveral miles down the same road.  I drove carefully to the service station where I purchased new a tire and had the shredded tire replaced.  I was relieved.  I'm grateful for this man.  He may have saved my life.  I'll never forget him - a true angel and example of how angels have touched me.

Could be off, happens now and then.  My husbands' grandmother use to say that every 7 years your body changes. *shrug* I don't know if that's true. . .\\n\\nAre you possibly pregnant? If it happens again next month I'd make an appointment to see a gyne.  I didn't have a gyne until I was married (21 as well).  I needed to find one becuase of a particular problem. Turned out to be a rare yeast infection. .. doesn't seem to apply to you. But still, a dr may be able to find something that can help you. Good luck!
You should make an appointment to see your Dr. Ask him to send you for a pulmonary function test. They can find out if you have asthma. They may do a methacholine challenge test. He may also order chest x-rays. There are other things that can cause wheezing and shortness of breath, but it could be asthma.
It's become, more or less, a formality.\\n\\nUsually the weaker teams send a rider on a suicide run, mostly for publicity, but also in hopes that the peloton will not see the rider as a threat and let him win.\\n\\nDepending on the stage and how far into the race, the teams may cooperate to reel in the break or let it go.\\n\\nFor instance, during the first week of the Tour de France, sprinter teams will not let any breaks get away because it's their only chance to score wins. They must capitalize on that opportunity because the mountain stages are not suited for them. Similarly, the climbers lay low in the peloton until the race reaches the mountains. It is their only chance to win so they will not let any breaks get away to spoil their chances at victory.\\n\\nThat's not to say breaks are fruitless endeavors. Transition stages are great opportunities for attackers. Usually, these are the only stages breakaway riders get, and they are far and few in between. Sometimes, attackers get lucky and the peloton misjudge the strength of the breakaway, or the peloton refuse to cooperate. The 2006 TdF contains numerous examples of this.

If you want to study it in college, begin looking at those that offer the program.  Then contact someone in the department to find out more specific information about the program such as requirements for graduating, what projects they are working on, how involved they are in the community, and who the professors are.  Make sure you that you keep in mind what YOUR interests are.  For example, don't choose a university that focuses on southwestern archaeology if you would rather study underwater archaeology.\\n\\nOnce you find a program you like and are accepted, get involoved in the depratment.  Get to know the professors and staff members. This will give you more opportunities for field experience or internships.  You will go alot further in the field if you know people than if you only attend class.  In archaeology, its who you know that really takes you places. It doesn't take long for us to realize who is really going to make it in the field.\\n\\nIf you are purely just interested in it, there are many books out there on the subject, some excellent and some fiction.  Make sure you choose something that was written by a archaeologist working at the academic level or a respected agency.  If you don't you may end up with something about divination.  Also, Archaeology Magazine is an excellent source about what going on in the field right now.  You may also be interested in joining the AIA (Archaeology Institute of America).  It has chapters all over the country which usually hold field trips and monthly lectures.\\n\\nWhat you do not want to do is play Indiana Jones and just start digging things up on your own.  Through education you will be taught the proper techniques and guidelines for excavation so the data you collect will be useful.  As soon as you dig something up, you will lose its context and any information it can give about the past.  Proper education will teach you how to save this information.\\n\\nSo, when it comes to Archaeology stay up to date, stay involved, and always be willing to learn something new!  \\n\\nIts an amazing field to be involved in and very rewarding!

There's really no 'better' choice. Both have advantages and disadvantages but whichever suits you best is better for you. \\nFor me optometry is 'better' because 1) i find eyes fascinating and would really enjoy learning about, examining, caring for, treating eyes. 2) Also, lawsuits are not common and the malpractice  insurance is lower. 3) Its a neat profession, you normally deal with healthy people, working conditions are great. 4) Its not stressful like dentistry.... i hear dentists have a high rate of suicide compared to other profession. \\nThe 2 reasons for choosing dentistry: 1) make way more money 2) not limited in what you can do (unlike in optometry where u cannot perform surgeries etc)  \\n\\nOPTOMERY: http://forums.studentdoctor.net/forumdisplay.php?f=21\\n\\nDENTAL: \\n http://forums.studentdoctor.net/forumdisplay.php?f=55

Being old-fashioned is great, and there are very few of us left. Let the guy approach you and ask you out first. This doesn't mean you can't speak with him and it doesn't mean you have to avoid him altogether. You can still get to know him but ultimately let him ask you out. I am the same way and love it when a guy will make the first move. Same goes for marriage proposals -- I would never be able to ask a man to marry me -- I would want him to ask me instead.

Since the MCAT is a pre req to med school, and med schools would require a transcript from an undergrad program, the average age of an MCAT taker would be around 20 years old.  However, if you are a genius of any sort and have completed the requirements ahead of the rest of the applicants the age at which you were to apply would be different.  Make sure you have done all the pre-work before even considering it.  Otherwise you will have to take it multiple times... not good!

The Microsoft Movie Maker (Built into XP) can probably get that down to size for you.  But a file that large will take a lot of time to compress to another type of file.  But to actually burn it to a DVD and watch it on a normal DVD Player (not PC in other words) You'll have to use a different piece of software.  I use Roxio's Easy Media Creator Home myself.  But if you do some searches on Google or Yahoo you might find something to your liking.  As for how to actuall acomplish your task with Roxio or Movie Maker.. you'll just have to read the tutorials in Movie Maker or the Manual of Roxio or whatever software you choose.

First of all the Bible does not say thou shalt not kill. It says thou shalt not commit murder, and there is a vast difference. Secondly the same Bible that says thou shalt not commit murder also says whosoever sheds man's blood by man shall his blood be shed. Also the same law that the ten commandments is in teaches clearly the death penalty for murder and several other crimes as well including rape, blasphemy, etc. We Christians don't make up our own religion we follow what the Bible taught. You misquote our Bible, that I don't think you have ever read, and then use your misquote to try and refute us. Read the Bible yourself before you throw it at us.
An X-ray machine is essentially a camera. Instead of visible light, however, it uses X-rays to expose the film. \\nX-rays are like light in that they are electromagnetic waves, but they are more energetic so they can penetrate many materials to varying degrees. When the X-rays hit the film, they expose it just as light would. Since bone, fat, muscle, tumors and other masses all absorb X-rays at different levels, the image on the film lets you see different (distinct) structures inside the body because of the different levels of exposure on the film. \\n\\nIf you want to know how X-rays themselves work try the site below.
Depends on the location.  A hot spot at a continental rift will probably generate massive basalt floods; while not explosive, these can cover vast areas.  A hot spot on the ocean floor will probably generate mild, Hawaii-like eruptions.  A hot spot under the continental crust--like Yellowstone--will probably generate a combination of massive basalt floods and explosive eruptions.

first of all i want to say, thank you for your love of the bigger ladies, because i am one, and second off people descriminate because the media discriminates against the larger sizes. the media always portrays the skinny women as hot, successful and powerful on tv and movies, and if you notice those of a larger size are always less successful, less powerful, and made to look dorky...it sucks, but it's nice to see someone stepping up and going public with his appreciation, you're a shining light to all those larger ladies who are looking for a good guy that will love them the way they are! Kudos to you!
I don't have a calculator handy, but I'll help where I can.\\n\\nEvaporation is endothermic, meaning that it takes in heat.  The amount of heat taken in when one mole of water evaporates is its molar enthalpy of vaporization.\\n\\nSo, first, find out how much of the water evaporated.  Assuming standard conditions, 1 mL of water weighs 1g.  So that means that 16g of water evaporated. (With me so far?)  Now use that to find out that you have a bit less than on mole of water vapor.\\n\\nWhere did the energy that the evaporating water use come from?  The other molecules of water.  You know that the amount of energy released when 284g of water decreases temperature is related in the formula q=mC(Tfinal-Tinitial).  (Only the other 284g of water decreased temp...the other 16g gained temp.)  Now you can figure out how much energy the water vapor absorbed when it changed into a gas.\\n\\nTake the energy # and divide by the # of moles... and you are set.\\n\\n\\nOh side note: since you are dropping the pressure, you do not need to worry about heating the water up inorder to make it boil.

Show your peers that you care about their world, too.\\n\\n* Well, on the flip side, you can't do things just so people will like you. People can dislike people for no reason at all.

In physics and chemistry, a plasma is typically an ionized gas, and is usually considered to be a distinct phase of matter in contrast to solids, liquids and gases. "Ionized" means that at least one electron has been dissociated from a proportion of the atoms or molecules. The free electric charges make the plasma electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields.\\n \\n\\n  A Bose–Einstein condensate is a phase of matter formed by bosons cooled to temperatures very near to absolute zero. The first such condensate was produced by Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman in 1995 at the University of Colorado at Boulder, using a gas of rubidium atoms cooled to 170 nanokelvins (nK). Under such conditions, a large fraction of the atoms collapse into the lowest quantum state, at which point quantum effects become apparent on a macroscopic scale.\\n\\n\\nThis fourth state of matter was first identified in a discharge tube (or Crookes tube), and so described by Sir William Crookes in 1879 (he called it "radiant matter")[1]. The nature of the Crookes tube "cathode ray" matter was subsequently identifed by English physicist Sir J.J. Thomson in 1897[2], and dubbed "plasma" by Irving Langmuir in 1928 [3], perhaps because it reminded him of a blood plasma [4]. Langmuir wrote:\\n\\n"Except near the electrodes, where there are sheaths containing very few electrons, the ionized gas contains ions and electrons in about equal numbers so that the resultant space charge is very small. We shall use the name plasma to describe this region containing balanced charges of ions and electrons."[3] \\nMore specifically, a plasma is an electrically conductive collection of charged particles that responds collectively to electromagnetic forces. Plasma typically takes the form of neutral gas-like clouds or charged ion beams, but may also include dust and grains (called dusty plasmas) [5] They are typically formed by heating and ionizing a gas, stripping electrons away from atoms, thereby enabling the positive and negative charges to move freely.

Yes, due to the phone or transmission lines being impacted in the area of the blast.  Due to the nature of the grid system, however, the lines will be 're-routed' around the blast and should have you up in running in no time, that is, of course, if there are no other detonations elsewhere.  \\n\\nIt is also theoretically speculated that high enough kiloton yields at very high altitudes can have effects on the entire continent.  Since airborne tests were stopped in 1963, only computer simulations and theoretical projections have been made regarding the impact of the EMP.
The first Article of the Constitution of India, which deals with the official name, states that "India, that is Bharat. . "\\n\\nBhārata, sometimes Bhāratavarsha (Bhārat or Bhāratvarsha in Hindi) is the name in Sanskrit and many languages of India for northern India. The Hindi form is also an official name of the Republic of India, and possibly the earliest name given to the nation.\\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology_of_India
I will take the "poorly served" side of the argument.  Congress is a very inefficient institution for doing what it is designed to do: express the will of the people.  Most of the people want capital punishment, legalization of pot, effective control of the borders, freedom to keep and bear arms, low taxes, small government, easy access to abortions, and a simple tax code.  Most of all, people want laws that make sense and that don't constantly change back and forth.\\n\\nBut with Congress set up on the two party system; and with members facing election every two years in the House and every six in the Senate, each member is constantly in need of electioneering funds and must spend inordinate amounts of time campaigning.  Worse, members are constantly pandering to both their own party's platform issues and to whatever the current fads in public policy are.  Thus, they waste huge amounts of time and money over inconsequential issues like gay marriage, while spending less than sufficient time on serious issues like how to control the Southern border and what to do about the millions of illigals who are already in the country.\\n\\nBut this is what you get when you have a democracy, "...of the people, by the people, and for the people...", as Lincoln said.  And as Churchill said, "Democracy is the worst form of government known to man...except for all the rest."

Just because the Hindu religion has many dieties does not mean that a Hindu worships all of them. Some of them just focus only on one.\\n\\nWhen one focuses on too many dieties in their worship to aide their spiritual growth, that is spreading energies too thin and not creating much of a progress.\\n\\nAmma told a story of this devotee that when he went to go see a guru. This guru worshiped so many different dieties. This devotee started digging a hole when the guru worshiped a diety. Then when the guru would go to the next diety and pray to that one, and the devotee would stop digging the hole and move to dig another new hole. The devotee kept digging so many small holes for all of the different dieties. I don't have the exact wording of this story but the concept is that this devotee wasn't able to successfuly dig one deep hole.\\n\\nBy focusing on one diety, one can really seriously feel their energies more. Also just because one focuses on one diety does not mean they wouldn't partake in many of the cultural festivals that celebrate other dieties. That would be more of a holiday, cultural aspect rather than actually worshiping it on a daily basis.\\n\\nWhat Hindu is in "general" as a religion does not always mean that it is the same for a specific person.
people dont want to admit theyre sinful and that they are doing wrong\\nto admit that Jesus is your savior means that you are admitting that you are living your life in sin, and that you need to be saved.  it is natural for people to sin, and to leave your sinful ways is very difficult.  many people would rather choose to ignore it and pass it off as fiction so they will not feel grievance

I've tried it and it did not work for me.  I was always hungry while following the diet religiously.  Everyone is different too, it may work very well for some and not for others.  So, give it a try and if it works for you then great, if not, don't get frustrated.  Try something else.  As with any weight loss program, you do need to follow it.  So, good luck.
any man or woman 40 lbs overweight would be sent to a diet farm, and kept there til normal again

(m)\\n\\nHobo is a term that refers to certain wandering homeless people, particularly those who make a habit of freighthopping. The iconic image of a hobo is that of a downtrodden, shabbily-dressed and perhaps drunken male, one that was solidified in American culture during the Great Depression. Hobos are often depicted carrying a bindle.\\n\\nThe hobo imagery has been employed by entertainers to create wildly succesful characters in the past, most famously Emmett Kelly's "Weary Willy" and Red Skelton's "Freddy the Freeloader".

Lyrics to Keisha White I Choose Life\\n\\nUsed to be easy, \\nUsed to have truth hangin’ round, \\nNever had secrets, \\nAlways singin’ your praises good and loud, \\n\\n(The relationship started out good, honest, and she was proud to have him)\\n\\nAll I got is questions, \\nAnd you left me wondering why, \\nWhy you keep your distance, \\nEvery lonely night, \\n\\n(He doesn't come home every night and she wonders what it is he is doing because he doesn't tell her)\\n\\nWhen love was bound together, \\nBelieved it by the letter, \\nIt closed my eyes for ever, \\nCause  everything has changed and now… \\n\\n(They used to be tight and she closed her eyes to anything that might be wrong)\\n\\nI ain’t gonna look the other way, \\nAfter all the clouds go by, \\nIt’s just another empty sky, \\nI ain’t gonna wait to see the rain, \\nNothing’s gonna make it right, \\nLook at me cause I choose life, \\n\\n(She isn't going to let him get away with his crap, she isn't going to wait for it to get better, she is going to move on)\\n\\nIt’s all about giving, \\nIt’s not about winning the game, \\nMy mind was opened, \\nReady or not you closed it up again, \\nStill I keep asking, \\nIf you’ve got something to hide, \\nI never stopped learning, all the reasons why, \\n\\n(In a relationship you have to give yourself, she gave herself and he didn't and he hurt her so she closed up inside. She thinks he is hiding something because she learned he has in the past)\\n\\nIt took about a minute, \\nTo find the point and hit it, \\nGotta take this life and live it, \\nCause everything has changed and now… \\n\\n(It didnt take her long to find the problem and fix it because life is short and you have to live it)\\n\\nI ain’t gonna look the other way, \\nAfter all the clouds go by, \\nIt’s just another empty sky, \\nI ain’t gonna wait to see the rain, \\nNothing’s gonna make it right, \\nLook at me cause I choose life, \\n\\nWhen all the lights go out, \\nSo suddenly, I lose my way, \\nSo baby tell me, is something goin on, \\nYou gotta free me, this time I’m gonna be strong, \\n\\n(She feels clueless when he doesn't tell her whats going on. It makes her believe he is doing something wrong and she wants him to break it off because she isn't strong enough to do it herself)\\n\\nI ain’t gonna look the other way, \\nAfter all the clouds go by, \\nIt’s just another empty sky, \\nI ain’t gonna wait to see the rain, \\nNothing’s gonna make it right, \\nLook at me cause I choose life, \\n\\nI ain’t gonna look the other way, \\nAfter all the clouds go by, \\nIt’s just another empty sky, \\nI ain’t gonna wait to see the rain, \\nNothing’s gonna make it right, \\nLook at me cause I choose life,

Doesn't seem that intelligent?  Have ever seen an interview with him? I don't even know you but I would venture to guess he could talk circles around you.\\n\\nYes, all of his actions as Marilyn Manson are designed to garner as much as attention as possible.
Statement a is true.  B is not true, as distinct great circles (which are the lines of spherical geometry) intersect at two points which are antipodes of one another.  C is not true for the reason you observed, as is D.  Thus A is the only statement that can be true.  Of course, we have to understand what a segment is in spherical geometry.  In Euclidean geometry, a line segment is that portion of a line which falls between two points (this is an informal definition, by the way.)  What is true about line segments in Euclidean geometry is that they are paths of minimum distance between their endpoints.  In other words, every other path between two points is longer than the line segment between them.\\n\\nArmed with this knowledge, lets talk about segments in spherical geometry.  They will be portions of lines (great circles) between two points.  Notice that, given any two points on a sphere, there is at least one great circle that passes through them (if these points are antipodes, there are infinitely many!)  Here's one difference between Euclidean and spherical geometry:  on a sphere, there are two line segments between these points.  Draw a circle and put two points at random on the circle:  you'll see both segments right in front of you.  One of these will be of shorter length that the other (unless you picked antipodal points, in which case the line segments will be of equal length.)  \\n\\nSo, what does this have to say about shortest distance?  Great circles are what as known as geodesics, which are constructed as paths which minimize distances between points on a space.  Straight lines are the geodesics of Euclidean space.  This isn't trivial to show.  So A is somewhat true, in that it is true that the shortest distance between two points on a sphere is given by a line segment (portion of a great circle.)  It is not true in that any line segment is the shortest distance between those points.
Football is a team game. Its need 100% team-effort to win a vital match. It is true that the world best players are playing for Real Madrid, but maximum of them are aged. They are now not as good as they had before four years. So the efficency of team is quite low than other renowned team like Barcilona, Villareal, Real Jaragoja, AC & Inter Milan, Juventas, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, Man United, Benfica etc. Not only that, the ego problem is also ruin the team efforts of Real Madrid. The coach is unable to control those super stars. The Real Madrid Management have change their coach several times in recent past. I hope they will overcoma this problem and contract with some young star footballer like Henri, C. Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Kaka, Mesi, Balack, etc. in future.

We can only be rid of religions when:\\n- Critical thinking skills are taught in schools and applied to religious arguments.\\n- Parents are convinced that loading unsubstantiated nonsense into a child's mind is mental abuse.\\n- Religions are taxed like nay other for-profit biz. This will chnage the mindset that they are "something special".\\n\\nEven then, it could be around for a long time.
I am so sorry for her and for you. \\n\\nNobody here can make an expert evaluation of her problems and prognosis, though. You really need to speak with her doctors. It may be time to let her go peacefully - when my mother was dying, the people in hospice told us that even though she was not able to communicate, she could still hear, and that it was important for us to tell her that we loved her and that it was okay for her to let go. That she didn't have to keep fighting after her body had worn out. \\n\\nDo consider hospice if the doctor tells you straight out that your aunt is not going to recover. The people who do hospice are incredibly kind and supportive, and they will make whatever time is left for her as comfortable and serene as possible.  No more invasive tests or waking her up to take blood pressure or all the other disruptive things that have to get done in regular hospital care.\\n\\nAgain, I am very sorry that her condition is so bad. Don't be afraid to cry - just try not to act too emotional in her presence. And if she does die, it's going to hurt terribly - knowing that it's coming does not make it easy - allow yourself to grieve.
I was with my man for almost a year before he told me he loved me. I tild him like 3 months into the relationship and yes I did want him to say it back, but I didn't push him. I still told him everyday that I love him but I didn't push him to say it back. Just give him time I am sure he will figure it out that you aren't going to burn him and he will decide when it is right for him to say it back.
Yoda beating up on the red guards. When Yoda walks into Palpatine's office and slams the two guards without hesitation or any real effort. It's a great show of power for the little green guy and foreshadowing for the upcoming battle between Sith Master and Jedi Master. And it's just plain funny.

Your wrong to some degree but so is he and so are they.  People tend to be proud of their lives and they most often express that pride to family which is you and your boyfriend.  Yes, they probably carry it too far, but I doubt if it is meant to make you feel bad.  Your boyfriend is wrong because he shouldn't be mad at you.  He should have been understanding and talked you about it.  There was no reason to be mad at you for your feelings regardless of if he believed them or not.
if he loves you and doesn't want anyother why did he leave you???

Parabolae show up everywhere in the world around us. For example:\\n\\n1. The reflecting mirror at the back of a headlight is a parabola. \\n\\n2. Parabolae are used to describe the trajectories of projectiles. \\n\\n3. Satellite dishes are parabolae. \\n\\n4. The surface of a fluid that is being rotated is a parabola. \\n\\n5. The microphones used to pick up distant sounds, like those on a football field, have a parabolic reflector behind them. \\n\\n6. The equation for the stopping distance of a car as a function of speed is a parabola. \\n\\n7. While the shape of a hanging cable between two poles is a catenary, but the shape of the cable holding up a suspension bridge is actually a parabola. \\n\\n8. The velocity as a function of radius in a pipe is a parabola. \\n\\n9. Under some conditions, orbits of meteors, comets, etc are parabolae.\\n\\n10. radio telescopes are shaped like parabolae\\n\\nand many others.
True.  No one can look at your boobs if you don't show them.  You can't complain about people looking at things that you are showing off.  The only reason women complain about it is because they want to be tramps but they don't others to think they are tramps.  See how that works?

Laura's suggestion is interesting.  I'm sure it works for some but personally I hate when people ask me lots of questions in order to make conversation.  Therefore I also avoid asking others too many questions because you never know when you're hitting a sore spot.  Like "what do you do"?  They could have just been laid off, or my favorite: people ask me if I have kids, and since we've been trying for awhile and not yet succeeded, it is a painful question to be asked.  Anyway, so I try to avoid asking questions and instead I make conversation based on sharing the present moment with the person.  The most classic is commenting on the weather, or if we're at a party, "hey, i like this music", or "the food's really good".  I find this usually creates a natural comfort level when i share about the present experience with the person because that is what is usually on peoples' mind that very moment. I used to have a lot of problems with this, and read something about grounding oneself, using our five senses to experience our surroundings.  Usually when we allow ourselves to just "BE" instead of feeling anxiety about what we will say, it comes more naturally to talk, because thoughts just pop in our head.  Like if i'm just "BEING" i may notice something around me and naturally say it to the person next to me, like, "that baby is so cute", or "look at that gorgeous sunset"... I find people usually respond to this natural way of expressing oneself.\\n\\nHope this helps. it's helped me, but takes practice. I'm sure you also know there are many books out there about socializing so you may want to check out your local library too.\\n \\nGood Luck.

Efficiency of photovoltaic energy depends on many factors:\\n\\n- Wavelength of Light: When light strikes the surface of a solar cell, some photons are reflected and do not enter the cell. Other photons pass through the material, some are absorbed but only have enough energy to generate heat and don't create charge carriers\\n\\n- Recombination: Charge carriers—which are electrons and holes—in a solar cell may inadvertently recombine before they make it into the electrical circuit and contribute to the cell's current.\\n\\n- Natural Resistance: The natural resistance to electron flow in a cell decreases cell efficiency.\\n\\n- Temperature: Solar cells work best at low temperatures, but solar cells work with sun light wich increases its temperature.\\n\\n- Reflection: When light arrives to any surface, a percentage of light will be reflected. A cell's efficiency can be increased by minimizing the amount of light reflected away from the cell's surface.\\n\\n- Electrical Resistance: Larger electrical contacts can minimize electrical resistance, but covering a cell with large, opaque metallic contacts would block too much incident light.\\n\\n- Quantum Efficiency: is the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected by the solar cell to the number of photons.\\n\\nbecause of that silicon solar cell efficiencies vary from 6% for amorphous silicon-based solar cells to 30% or higher with multiple-junction research lab cells (gallium arsenide or indium selenide).\\nSolar cell energy conversion efficiencies for commercially available mc-Si solar cells are around 12%.
This is a hard one for many,your gut wants you to stand up and say something and call them out on their name calling. But like you said 'they can fight' and you don't want a bunch of girls jumping you just cause you didn't like the things they are saying.Rumors can be very cruel in school and your peers seem to listen to them other then see the real YOU. Just remember those words are only words. Don't let them get to you or make your day bad. Only YOU can make your day bad by allowing them to get to you. Show others you are better then that and step tall with your head held high rumors will go away with more rumors, your pride will always remain in your heart don't step to their level. You cant change people only your reaction to them. ;-)

I believe "imacatholic2" answered your question very well and they were right to reference the Catechism of the Catholic Church because it covers all bases including biblical references in case you are one of those that say, "If it isn't in the Bible it doesn't exist.". You have to understand that the Bible doesn't always refer to some things by name, but by reference. Just like there are many references to a place where souls go to be purified before entering Heaven, even though the actual word "Purgatory" is not mentioned. The Bible was not written originally in English, so we should not quibble over semantics to get to Truth. So it is with "Guardian Angels". That particular English phrase is not spelled out but the references are numerous, and "Imacatholic2" spelled them out clearly and beautifully. I am a Catholic, too. God bless you,

Which body fluids can transmit the HIV virus, and which ones don't?\\n\\nBlood, pre-cum, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk all contain high concentrations of HIV, and all have been linked to transmission of the virus. \\n\\nSaliva, tears, sweat and urine can have the virus in them, but in such small concentrations that nobody has ever been infected through them. However, if any body fluid is visibly contaminated with blood, the risk of transmission exists. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow is HIV transmitted?\\nHIV must get into your bloodstream in order to infect you. If it doesn't get into the bloodstream, you will not get the infection. Blood, pre-cum, semen, vaginal secretions or breast milk must have direct access to your bloodstream in order to infect you. Activities where this can happen include vaginal intercourse (both partners), anal intercourse (both partners), giving oral sex, sharing needles (IV drugs, tattooing, etc.) and, rarely, through receiving a blood transfusion. HIV can also be transmitted from mother to child. HIV is not transmitted through any form of casual contact. \\nIn summary, in order for infection to occur, three things must happen: \\n\\nYou must be exposed to pre-cum, semen, vaginal secretions, blood or breast milk, AND \\nThe virus must get directly into your bloodstream through some fresh cut, open sore, abrasion etc., AND \\nTransmission must occur, directly from one person to the other, very quickly (the virus does not survive more than a few minutes outside the body).\\nNo matter what the circumstances are, if you think about these three criteria for transmission, you'll be able to determine whether you're at risk for HIV or not. But do remember that other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can be transmitted more easily than HIV, so what might be low risk for HIV may be high risk for other STDs.

According to sites in our Texas category, the name of Texas comes from the Indian words "teysha" or "tejas." These words mean either "hello friend" or "friendly" -- which makes sense, because Texans can be very friendly people! Early in Texas history, people from this area were called "Texians." Did you know that six different flags have flown over Texas in its history? First Spain, then France, Mexico, the Confederacy, and the Republic of Texas each ruled the region before Texas became part of the United States in 1845. Yee-haw!

Cold fusion is a nuclear fusion reaction which its proponents claim occurs well below the temperature required for thermonuclear reactions (millions of degrees Celsius) in a relatively small "table top" apparatus. A variety of experimental methods are used; originally electrolytic cells. The idea was first brought into popular consciousness by the Fleischmann-Pons experiment in March of 1989, which was front-page news for some time, and has been controversial ever since. Cold fusion is sometimes referred to as low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) or chemically-assisted nuclear reactions (CANR

That's a lot to ask for and right now you should be cramming as much as you can and not thinking about everyone else's opinion. My advice, read the book or at least skim through the important stuff before you walk into the test. That's what I do when I procrastinate and it actually helps me.

The world wide church is called the Anglican Church. Each country has its own branch, and in the U.S. that is called the Episcopalian, which means governed by Bishops. In the U.K. is it called the Church of England. They are all part of the same "Anglican Communion". The head of the Episcopal church is called the Presiding Bishop. The head of the whole Anglican Church is the Arch Bishop of Canterbury. He does not have the same position in the Anglican Church as the Pope does in the Roman Church because the Anglican Church is run as more of a democracy.

There are MANY types of headaches...with several different origins. The most common one is the tension headache, which originates in muscle spasm in the neck and shoulder areas. Others include things like migraines, cluster headaches, and they are also a common feature in many other illnesses like the flu or other generalized infections. They may come from muscular sources, vascular sources (in the blood vessels of the head or brain), or--RARELY--from increased pressure inside the head from something like a brain tumor or fluid mechanics problem.  Most headaches are simply a nuisance, though some can truly be debilitating, and NOT related to any serious pathology.

The purpose of the Virgin Birth story in regards to Jesus was to give him a miracle birth like all the other dying/saving  man/gods of the ancient world. Many of them were born of a human mother and a god for a father. Even Hercules had a human mother, Elcmene, and Zeus for a father. Dionysus had Semele for his human mother and, again, Zeus for his father, and the death of Dionysus was seen by his follers as dying for their sins.\\n\\nWhat everyone forgets is that IF Jesus was born of a virgin, then he cannot trace his lineage back to King David, and he therefore could not have been the Messiah! Some might say that this was to prevent him from being a descendant of Jehoikim, Jeconiah, or Shealtiel whose descendants, like Joseph, were cursed and would preclude a descendant of them from being the Messiah. But you cant have your cake and eat it too. He cant get the benefit from being a descendant of David through Joseph, without the curse that comes from being a descendant of those three, if he is to claim being from the House of David through Joseph.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Bible makes it clear that the Real Messiah is not adopted into the Davidic Line, but must be a direct bloodline descendant through his own human father back to King David, through Solomon.\\n\\nAnd if one were to actually pick up the Bible and read it, one would see that every single genealogy in the Bible traces the lineage through the father. If a mother is mentioned it is because she was famous, but the lineage still goes through her husband and not her. This is also true in the Christians' New Testament, where both Matthew and Luke trace Jesus's lineage through the males. This means that even if Mary was a descendant of King David, it would not matter because one's lineage is traced through one's father, not one's mother.

Industrial wastes cause pollution in four major areas: air, water, soil and atmosphere. Those wastes that are gaseous pollute air that living things breath or use for food production as in plants. Gaseous wastes in air will either kill living things or disturb their normal processes. Gaseous pollutants also pollute our atmosphere that the atmosphere will lose its ability of blanketing the earth from hostile rays coming from the sun and space. Acid rain is as well caused by gaseous wastes. Wastes also pollute water bodies and soil and result in killing or disturbing the normal processes of living things specially plants.

Self-confidence is an attitude which allows individuals to have positive yet realistic views of themselves and their situations. Self-confident people trust their own abilities, have a general sense of control in their lives, and believe that, within reason, they will be able to do what they wish, plan, and expect. \\n\\nHaving self-confidence does not mean that individuals will be able to do everything. Self-confident people have expectations that are realistic. Even when some of their expectations are not met, they continue to be positive and to accept themselves. \\n\\nPeople who are not self-confident depend excessively on the approval of others in order to feel good about themselves. They tend to avoid taking risks because they fear failure. They generally do not expect to be successful. They often put themselves down and tend to discount or ignore compliments paid to them. By contrast, self-confident people are willing to risk the disapproval of others because they generally trust their own abilities. They tend to accept themselves; they don't feel they have to conform in order to be accepted. \\n\\nSelf-confidence is not necessarily a general characteristic which pervades all aspects of a person's life. Typically, individuals will have some areas of their lives where they feel quite confident, e.g.,academics, athletics, while at the same time they do not feel at all confident in other areas, e.g., personal appearance, social relationships.

Matthew 18:15ff and Galatians 6 are the clearest NT references.  \\n\\nBut there are more.  One very good one is the often missed original setting of the "second greatest commandment" --\\n\\nLeviticus 19:17-18\\nDo not hate your brother in your heart. Rebuke your neighbor frankly so you will not share in his guilt.\\nDo not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the LORD. \\n\\nAlong the same lines is a set of instructions by Paul in\\nEphesians 4:25-27 Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we are all members of one body. "In your anger do not sin"[=Psalm 4:4]: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold.\\n\\nThis echoes Paul's call in v.15 to "Tell the truth in love." as part of building up the body in love (and avoiding deceit and error).\\n\\nFor some reason many separate the warning about anger from the call to be truthful.  But I believe they are intended to be read together.  As in Leviticus 19 the warning is against keeping it to yourself and nursing a grudge rather than correcting and RESTORING your brother and (in the case of sin BETWEEN you), of reconciling/making peace/restoring the RELATIONSHIP (cf. Matthew 5:23-24 which looks at the other side, calling us to go seek restoration if someone has something against US).  \\n\\nNote: the purpose must NOT be to "get it off my chest", for my own sake [so I won't be a hypocrite?]  It's about not allowing your brother to continue in sin without warning or seeking to restore him [thus we tell him as an expression of LOVING our neighbor] and the related sin of allowing a grudge to fester in my heart.  This is were the Galatians 6 call to be gentle & humble comes in.\\n\\nAlso note that there is not some generalized command to bring EVERY sin to people's attention!   It is for the sake of that person's good, for the health of the body, for restoration and reconciliation...    There are MANY sins for which the final word should be "Love covers a multitude of sins." (1 Peter 4:8)

Cold, concentrated sulfuric acid is used with neutral, water-insoluble compoinds containing no elements other than carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.  If the compound is unsaturated, is readily sulfonated, or possesses a functional group containing oxygen, it will dissolve in cold concentrated sulfuric acid.  This is frequently accompanied by a reaction such as sulfonation, polymerization, dehydration, or addition of the sulfuric acid to olefinic or acetylenic linkages.  In many cases, however, the solute may be covered by dilution with ice water.

I agree with you 100%. The USA needs to wake up and start taking care of their selves, stop sending our food and giving our money to other nations, who wish we all would just kill over and die, who hates our guts and wants to watch as our Country disappears, sure they like our money and food and medical, heck its free who wouldn't want it free. But come on wake up here USA; take care of your own people first, help all those who are starving and cannot even afford to feed/cloth their own families. We/USA preach about our freedom, but yet we are constantly giving it up to other Countries, illegal immigrants seem to have more rights than we do, now tell me whats wrong with this picture, if we were to go to their Countries and demand our political rights, etc. we would be kicked out or thrown in jail. So come on USA lets wake up and stop giving our Country away to everyone else, Lets take it back and keep it the home of the free and the brave.

Bones and Booth go down to the tunnels that run underneath Washington, D.C. to investigate a body. They find out the body was a women documentary maker. She was making a film about the people who live underground. One of the suspects was man, who lives underground. Bones found a crate in his house, that had bloody clothes, and a camera. After talking to him, they find out he gave her something, and he is convinced that is the reason she died. They find a amulet with her things and soon discover it goes to a vault. In the show, they said that during the 1800's the American government had vaults full of precious items hidden in vaults under Washington. Some of the vaults were never found due to cave ins. So Bones and Booth try to find the vault. Along the way they discover another body. This one being from the Civil War. They also find that the documentary maker hired two rock climbers to help her find the treasure. Bones and Booth soon realize that one of the climbers had killed the women. Before they can arrest them they have to find them. They both believe they are in the vault. So underground they go. They find the two in a vault loading gold into bags. Bones finally gets to point a gun at someone. In the end one of the climbers killed the women because of greed. The first suspect was released and went back underground.

I guess the only way to get a statistic would be to just watch games and take notes.  Otherwise, the only thing I could think of was to get the average speed of which the ball leaves the bat and also the average distance from the plate that outfielders play.  Then you could estimate how long they have to react and how fast the ball is going.  As for positioning of the infielders, I don't know how you could account for that.  Hope that helps, just a quick idea!

From Wikipedia.org:\\n\\n"first devised in 1869 by the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev. Mendeleev intended the table to illustrate recurring ("periodic") trends in the properties of the elements."\\n\\n"The original table was created before the discovery of subatomic particles or the formulation of current quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure. If one orders the elements by atomic mass, and then plots certain other properties against atomic mass, one sees an undulation or periodicity to these properties as a function of atomic mass. The first to recognize these regularities was the German chemist Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner who, in 1829, noticed a number of triads of similar elements:\\nSome triads Element Molar mass\\n(g/mol) Density\\n(g/cm³) Quotient\\n(cm³/mol)\\nchlorine 35.4527 0.003214 11030\\nbromine 79.904 3.122 25.6\\niodine 126.90447 4.93 25.7\\n \\ncalcium 40.078 1.54 26.0\\nstrontium 87.62 2.64 33.2\\nbarium 137.327 3.594 38.2\\n\\nThis was followed by the English chemist John Newlands, who noticed in 1865 that the elements of similar type recurred at intervals of eight, which he likened to the octaves of music, though his law of octaves was ridiculed by his contemporaries. Finally, in 1869, the German Julius Lothar Meyer and the Russian chemistry professor Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev almost simultaneously developed the first periodic table, arranging the elements by mass. However, Mendeleev plotted a few elements out of strict mass sequence in order to make a better match to the properties of their neighbours in the table, corrected mistakes in the values of several atomic masses, and predicted the existence and properties of a few new elements in the empty cells of his table. Mendeleev was later vindicated by the discovery of the electronic structure of the elements in the late 19th and early 20th century.\\n\\nIn the 1940s Glenn T. Seaborg identified the transuranic lanthanides and the actinides, which may be placed within the table, or below (as shown above)."

His involvement on the book was more of his famous paintings which the author has shown much ignorance in his interpretation of Leonardo Da Vinci's work of art such as the Mona Lisa, Madonna on the Rocks and the Last Supper. \\n\\nThe book is just a fiction. And it has no evidences to support its claims. \\n\\nTo understand more about Leonardo Da Vinci and how he was associated in the book, allow me to refer you to this site: http://www.jesusdecoded.com/leonardo1.php?page=100

First thing I would like to say should get good practical knowledge of remote administration for WEB Server if you intended to work from Lebanon.\\n\\nPost your resume on internet and provide you can administer WEB server remotely. It would be hard as you will fresher but that is you have to prove that you can do.\\n\\nSecond options do find job in Lebanon it self with LAN management which is good for experience. Even bigger LAN management is challenging job.\\n\\nGetting job with MCSE is not Q but is there job around in local market or international market. If you have I.Q for programming (It is not I.Q but urge to make programs) then it can be clubbed with networking that can pay really well. \\n\\nPassing MCSE through dumps can lead you nowhere well Passing that could make you eligible but that wouldn’t teach you much it is all you have to decide.\\n\\nLinux is another good option and there are business who wants free software to deployed in there networks. Only issue lack of trained Linux engineer and programmer for there in built requirements. \\n\\nHope you can decide on it.

Only in fiction, TV, and Hollywood. You love a car at 1st sight. A dog at 1st sight. Maybe even a house. But with people it is lust at 1st sight then maybe some love grows out of it. Usually once the hot fire of lust cools the relationship goes South, because there is nothing to anchor it on. If it were love at 1st sight 95% of the people would marry and stay married to those they were dating. That don't happen. Reality sets in and you find out someone is too clingy, too sloppy, too jealous, too lazy, hot headed, has too much baggage etc. If it were love you would look pass ALL of that and want them as Forest Gump wanted Jenny no matter how much they screwed up or rejected you. You would wait forever and endure all for real love. Does that happen? Love at 1st sight only exist in Hollywood, TV, and in the movies.

You need to know whether your ex-partner-to-be intends to deal with this in an ethical way, or not.\\n\\nIn the event that the two of you intend to dispose of the property and divide the profits and your partner is dealing with you ethically there is nothing you need to do.  \\n\\nHowever, if he is going to live in the property or if he is not dealing with you equitably, then you need to retain a attorney who specializes in Real Estate law to help you deal with this.\\n\\nGood luck.

Getting your degree in engineering would definately put you on the right track to getting into this field.  Architecture, not so much...Most schools with programs in Architecture focus on buildings.  You might also look into Industrial Design.  Look for a school that offers courses in Product Design, Interaction Design, Project Management or Transportation Design.  All of those will be physics and engineering heavy, so those are the classes to keep focus on.  Good luck!

I don't know how "Christian" these are but they are two of my favorite religious jokes.\\n\\n#1 - On the outskirts of town, there was huge nut tree by the cemetery fence. One day two boys filled up a bucketful of nuts and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts.\\n"One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me," said one boy. The bucket was so full, several rolled out toward the fence.\\nCycling down the road by the cemetery was a third boy. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate. Sure enough, he heard, "One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me."\\nHe knew what it was. "Oh my," he shuddered, "It's Satan and St. Peter dividing the souls at the cemetery."\\nHe cycled down the road fast as he could and found an old man with a cane, hobbling along. "Come here quick," said the boy, "You won't believe what I heard. Satan and St. Peter are down at the cemetery dividing the souls."\\nThe man said, "Shooo, you brat, can't you see I'm finding it hard to walk as it is." But after several pleas, the man hobbled to the cemetery. Standing by the fence they heard, "One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me . . ."\\nThe old man whispered, "Boy, you've been telling the truth. Let's see if we can see the devil himself." Shivering with fear, they peered through the fence, yet they were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of Satan.\\nAt last they heard, "One for you, one for me. And one last one for you. That's all. Now let's go get those nuts by the fence, and we'll be done."\\nThey say the old guy made it back to town five minutes before the boy.\\n\\n#2 A small rural community, so small, in fact, the only church in town is a small Baptist church whose pastor must also double up as the local barber to make ends meet. There happened to be a man in this small community who had invested wisely and was enjoying his newfound comfort. This man got out of bed one day to go through his daily routine. He looked into the mirror as he was about to shave and decided, "I make enough money now, I don't have to shave myself. I'll go down to the barber and let him shave me from now on." So he did. \\n  He walked into the barber shop and found the preacher/barber was out calling on the shut-ins. His wife, Grace, said "I usually do the shaves anyway ... sit down and I'll shave you." So he did. She shaved him and he asked, "How much do I owe you?" "$25," Grace replied. The man thought that was somewhat expensive and that he may have to get a shave every other day. Nonetheless, he paid Grace and went on his way.\\nThe next day, he woke up and found his face to be just as smooth as the day before. No need for a shave today, he thought, well, it was a $25 shave. \\nThe next day he awoke to find his face as smooth as a baby's bottom. Wow! he thought. That's amazing, as he normally would need to shave daily to keep his clean-shaven business look. \\nDay 3, he woke up and his face was still as smooth as the minute after Grace had finished. Now, somewhat perplexed, the man went down to the barber shop to ask some questions. \\nThis particular day the pastor was in and the man asked him why his face was as smooth as it was the first day it was shaven. The kind old pastor gently retorted, "Friend, you were shaved by Grace ... and once shaved, always shaved."
INDIA IS THE BEST.
TRINITY IN THE BIBLE \\n\\nReferences in the Bible to a Trinity of divine beings are vague, at best. \\n\\nIn Matthew 28:19, we find Jesus telling his disciples to go out and \\npreach to all nations. While the "Great Commission" does make mention of the three persons who later become components of the Trinity, the phrase \\n"...baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the \\nHoly Ghost" is quite clearly an addition to Biblical text - that is, not \\nthe actual words of Jesus - as can be seen by two factors: \\n\\n1) Baptism in the early Church, as discussed by Paul in his letters, was \\ndone only in the name of Jesus; and \\n\\n2) The "Great Commission" was found in the first gospel written, that of \\nMark, bears no mention of Father, Son and/or Holy Ghost - see Mark 16:15. \\n\\nThe only other reference in the Bible to a Trinity can be found in the \\nEpistle of I John 5:7, Biblical scholars of today, however, have admitted \\nthat the phrase "...there are three that bear record in heaven, the \\nFather, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one" is definitely a "later addition" to Biblical test, and it is not found in any of today's versions of the Bible. \\n\\nIt can, therefore, be seen that the concept of a Trinity of divine beings \\nwas not an idea put forth by Jesus or any other prophet of God. This \\ndoctrine, now subscribed to by Christians all over the world, is entirely \\nman-made in origin. \\n\\nTHE DOCTRINE TAKES SHAPE \\n\\nWhile Paul of Tarsus, the man who could rightfully be considered the true \\nfounder of Christianity, did formulate many of its doctrines, that of the \\nTrinity was not among them. He did, however, lay the groundwork for such when he put forth the idea of Jesus being a "divine Son." After all, a \\nSon does need a Father, and what about a vehicle for God's revelations to \\nman? \\n\\nIn essence, Paul named the principal players, but it was the later Church \\npeople who put the matter together. \\n\\nTertullian, a lawyer and presbyter of the third century Church in \\nCarthage, was the first to use the word "Trinity" when he put forth the theory that the Son and the Spirit participate in the being of God, but all are of one being of substance with the Father. \\n\\nA FORMAL DOCTRINE IS DRAWN UP \\n\\nWhen controversy over the matter of the Trinity blew up in 318 between \\ntwo church men from Alexandria - Arius, the deacon, and Alexander, his bishop - Emperor Constantine stepped into the fray. \\n\\nAlthough Christian dogma was a complete mystery to him, he did realize \\nthat a unified church was necessary for a strong kingdom. When negotiation failed to settle the dispute, Constantine called for the first ecumenical council in Church history in order to settle the matter once and for all. \\n\\nSix weeks after the 300 bishops first gathered at Nicea in 325, the \\ndoctrine of the Trinity was hammered out. The God of the Christians was \\nnow seen as having three essences, or natures, in the form of the Father, \\nthe Son, and the Holy Spirit. \\n\\nTHE CHURCH PUTS ITS FOOT DOWN \\n\\nThe matter was far from settled, however, despite high hopes for such on \\nthe part of Constantine. Arius and the new bishop of Alexandria, a man \\nnamed Athanasius, began arguing over the matter even as the Nicene Creed was being signed; "Arianism" became a catch-word from that time onward for anyone who did not hold to the doctrine of the Trinity. \\n\\nIt wasn't until 451, at the Council of Chalcedon that, with the approval \\nof the Pope, the Nicene/Constantinople Creed was set as authoritative. \\nDebate on the matter was no longer tolerated; to speak out against the Trinity was now considered blasphemy, and such earned stiff sentences that ranged from mutilation to death. Christians now turned on Christians, maiming and slaughtering thousands because of a difference of opinion. \\n\\nDEBATE CONTINUES \\n\\nBrutal punishments and even

i would advise you go back to the person who did your piercing, but since they did your initial piercing with sterling silver, then they are no good!  they should have done your initial piercing with stainless surgical steel...please find a reputable piercer in your area that uses stainless surgical steel for your initial piercing.\\nin the meantime if you want to save your piercing, go find a surgical steel nose ring asap to put in from a more reputable piercing place!  a good piercing place will help you with your problem.  if not, then you will have to wait until it heals and closes up and try again through a reputable piercer.  \\n\\nto heal/clear up the infection, try sea salt soaks (a pinch of sea salt in 3 oz of hot tap water, soak a cotton ball and put it over your piercing for 5 minutes). it worked for me!
How long it takes? Years and years...just getting the application approved to start the process!

It is also an unfair system. Cubans are all but automatically granted citizenship, while others can't get it no matter what they do. We have serious limits which vary from country to country.
Arguably soccer was invented in London in 1863 when men sat down to codify the games that they had enjoyed playing at their "public schools". An association called "The Football Association" was formed. The word "soccer" is short for "Association Football", as distinct from "Rugby Football", which was another sport codified by ex public schoolboys in the late 19th century.
Both Chief of nothing and navyav8r are correct. The review board is one of the hardest parts of the qualification process. the questions can be as simple as drawing a diagram to telling the members hpw to take a molecule of water from the ocean and breath it in as air. The board usually lasts several hours but I have seen a few that lasted days. If he fails than he will be allowed to reboard after studying things that he really messed up on. Something that navyav8r was not correct about is that on this board the members do not review the comments made by the boardees supervisors. Once he passes the board he will be qualified submarines which is a great honor and should instill a large amount of pride in his accomplishment.\\nSTS2/SS Kris

Eric, dammit, if you want me to tell you all this; then I have to write a book, as well.\\n\\nI used to be a Republican and I lived most of my life in Washington, DC from the Truman years to the Nixon years.  All my family were civil servants in one capacity or another.\\n\\nThe conservatism we see today is nothing like the conservatism in the days of Reagan or before: it is all about dirty politics and hate mongering.   The good conservative people of our nation who have family values and inspire the American ideal, are being manipulated by the Republican party to no good end.\\n\\nI was alive in the late 40's and 50's and I remember the Reagan years quite well:  they were not that good. Working people were struggling during the Reagan years with higher gas prices, food costs, and higher retail prices.  This era was not a good one.  \\n\\nReagan was not St. Reagan; he was a man who had a great cabinet, a lot of charisma, and great common sense.    He also had a nutter for a wife who tried to control everything he did and after he was shot he was really not up to governing the US so Nancy was allowed to have too much power.  \\n\\nBy the way Reagan was not a conservative and his thoughts were much more liberal than anyone today would imagine.  He was an actor from Hollywood who had tons or problems with his family and did not treat his adoptive won well (Nancy again). \\n\\nReagan (when he was Pres. of the Screen Actors Guild) had the courage to fight the McCarthy Gestapo when they were tearing at the gates of Hollywood and the entertainment industry and ruining a lot of Reagan's constituents. Not many people stood up to McCarthy (who was the ultra Conservative of his day) but Reagan did.\\n\\nI often wonder if Reagan was alive today and had all his faculties; what he would say....He would not like being the icon of the Repulican party as it is today...I think he would be more of a Arnold Schwarzenegger type Republican and Reagan was all about honor.  He would not have put up with the Carl Rove types for 5 minutes.

First you should check in your BIOS.  IT is possible that since the machine had WIN98 originally that the BIOS never had USB support turned on.

Since I'm a hopeless romantic...I think real love is when you can't imagine being without that special someone even for a minute, that you could be content with that person by just being in their presence, that it feels like he/she is the other half of you, that kissing and making love to that person is the best thing you ever did, etc. Love is in your very being, in your heart, in your mind. it is up to you to define it. There is a one true love that is unconditional, no matter who you are: That love is the love of Jesus Christ, your Savior.

First, to correct one of the last posters, Ad-Aware's website is http://www.lavasoftusa.com.  It's most likely a spyware issue, or maybe even a virus issue but that's less likely.\\n\\nThe reason this happens is because sites that have http:// in the front of them are using port 80 to communicate.  When the site has https:// that means port 443 is being used, and that connection is secure.  So there is something that is blocking, interrupting, or taking over the communication flow for HTTP traffic.\\n\\nGood luck

To answer you question with another question...What is the difference between terrorism and collateral damage? Innocents die in anycase. Its the value of life associated with the victim that counts. Brown, dark and yellow people who live in far off lands, speak obscure languages, believe in obscure things and wear funny clothes and rags on their heads are not as valuable as our folk back home.  So killing a few of them, albeit be they innocent,  in the course of spreading democracy is well within the tolerance limits set by our civilized society.  Besides, they not completely innocent. The're muslim right and the 9/11 attackers were muslim right. So their you go. They can't be completely innocent. We just need to get them to understand that killing a few of their kids is all for a good cause. We did'nt target them. It just happened, like oops. And sometimes we say we're sorry.  Damn, if only they'd understand that we're killing them for their own good. Just see the brilliant mind numbing comment below. His got the spirit. You see, we Americans are superior to the rest of those folks.

Well clearly in the Playoffs you had the INT that got overturned in the Colts/Steelers game. I mean it was so bad that the NFL had to apoligize, thankfully it didn't cost the Steelers the game. Also in the playoffs if I'm not mistaken in the, Denver/New England game, where the guy clearly fumbled BEFORE going in the endzone and it was called a TD instead of a touchback. The refs really blew it in the playoffs. Then there was that game with the 2 point conversion where I think it was the FB Alscott(proably got the wrong name) that clearly didn't get over the line but was awarded the 2 point conversion that WON the game.

The electron accelerating back and forth sends out electromagnetic radiation, ie radio waves, that's all. Electrons actually travel relatively slowly in metals, due to frequent collisions with the metallic lattice. So there is no  fantastic disruptions to the space-time continuum. It is electric pressure that moves very quickly which allows eletrical signals to be sent so quickly. The effect is the same as turning on a tap to a long hose already full of water. Water will start coming out the other end of the hose long before the water at the tap reaches the nozzle.
The water level would of decreased due to water being the only substance in chemistry that expands when in a solid state.\\n\\nTherefore, Archimedes theory that the volume of water will be displaced by the volume of the ice cubes. Thus, because water expends when frozen, the volume of water will be less when the ice cubes have melted.
Yes.  Fat cells are consumed for energy, which is why you can lose weight by exercising.  When you eat extra food, your body converts the excess energy into a storable chemical form, fat.  When you push your body to consume extra energy, as by exercising, the fat cells are raided and you lose weight.
Once or twice I peeked a look at a friend's paper, and once or twice I did my friend's homework assignment.  I never got caught and now that I am in university I NEVER cheat.

The trick to making something disappear is that it can only be done for people standing in a certain spot, it involves perspective and mirrors. I don't know any more than this, I saw a programme where a magician did these tricks but only teased with how it was done. There is always a trick to magic, but they are carefully guarded.

Michael,\\nThis is a question that many students struggle with.  How can I decide (at 18!) what I want to do with the rest of my life?  Sometimes it's a daunting question that you don't really want to answer.\\n\\nI was a university career counselor for 9 years, and here's my best advice:\\n\\n1.  Major in something you will LOVE to study.  You'll work harder at it, and be able to survive all that reading, those quizzes and tests, papers, long nights at the library, etc.\\n\\n2.  Visit your career services center starting your freshman year, and keep going!  Starting early, they can help with interest and personality assessments (quizzes you'll enjoy taking!), books and resources, and later, resumes, interviewing skills, connections to internships, summer jobs, mentors/networking contacts, and on-campus interviewing for jobs after you graduate.\\n\\n3.  If you think you have an interest in a particular path, start doing it as soon as possible!  I worked with a freshman who was determined to get a very competative fashion design internship.  She got it, and commuted from Philly to NYC three times a week - for no pay - to work for famous designer Anna Sui.  \\n\\n4.  Internships are key - start getting internships during your summer months as soon as you can.  Freshman sometimes get looked over, but try anyway.  If you can get three or more internships before you graduate, in fields you're interested in, you have a 60% likely chance of being offered a permanent job with that company.\\n\\n5.  Remember, most people don't figure out what they wanna be when they grow up until they reach age 26 or 27!  That means, even if you pick a major, pick a career, and start working, you might have 2-3 jobs before that age - and experience helps you to shape your career path.  \\n\\n6. Someone went there before you.  Seek out alumni contact through the career services or alumni offices, people doing the jobs you're interested in.  Contact them for short "interviews" where you ask questions about their job.  You'll learn a lot and make potential career-long contacts.\\n\\n7.  Never narrow your choices.  Start out with everything, and examine, read, try, learn, experience as many as you can.  You'll soon learn what you like and don't like.  And remember, you can always change your mind and pursue a different career later (most people change careers 6-7 times in their life).\\n\\n8.  Finally, remember that you'll have to get up every morning to go to this job.  If you love your job, then great, but if not, Mondays will look pretty bleak.  Success comes from pursuing your dreams and goals, things that make you happy, and creating the paths to get there.  Choosing a career because it makes money doesn't mean you'll be happy, but choosing a career you love means your heart is in it, and most likely, the money will follow too.\\n\\nBest of luck to you!\\nMichelle Watson Gellas\\n(former career counselor for Villanova University, Lehigh University, Ursinus College, and Loyola Marymount University)
If you are in love, you know it.  The main thing is that you can't imagine living without that person in your life.  That person is more important to you than anyone else...including yourself.
There are various legends about how the Tigers got their nickname. One has to do with the orange stripes they wore on their black stockings. Another has to do with a sportswriter equating that 1901 Detroit club's opening day victory to the ferocity of his alma mater, the Princeton Tigers.\\n\\nHowever, the truth is revealed in Richard Bak's 1998 book, A Place for Summer: A Narrative History of Tiger Stadium. In the 19th century, the city of Detroit had a military unit called the Detroit Light Guard, who were known as "The Tigers." They had played a significant role in certain Civil War battles and also in the then-recently-fought Spanish-American War. The ballclub had informally acquired that nickname as a minor league club, but upon entry into the majors they sought and received formal permission from the Light Guard to use their trademark, and from that day forth the ballclub was officially the Tigers.\\n\\nIn short, the Tigers wore stripes because they were already Tigers, rather than the other way around which is the conventional story.

Questions like yours make me want to run outside and hang my American flag...{hang on..be right back}.......OK. Your 25, Good job, ???? Move out!!  Be with your 28yr old broke guy who doesn't speak your language..I know plenty of people that get married with less going for them than that.  It's your life you poor sweet thing. Your parents will get over it...And if they don't.. You will. Be happy!! Good Luck!!!         Or, listen to your parents..marry some idiot you don't love, and be miserable the rest of your life and wonder...What if? The choice is easy.   Oh, and one more thing..You'll get over that "Money doesn't matter, Love matters"  thing...Maybe that's why his parents like you so much... They want the bum out of the house! {just kidding}.
I suggest that you get hold of a guitar tutor book like "Teach yourself the guitar" and work through the book fairly slowly. You will probably find that the fingers of your left hand will develop blisters from pressing on the frets, but with time these should disappear. \\n\\nAlthough you might want to learn fast it is better to try to build up your technique slowly and make sure that you are comfortable with one lesson before you move on to the next one. Lots of people learn to strum a few chords on the guitar, but it takes time and effort to learn to play it really well.
* Start hiking regularly\\n* Start doing some exercises that will build your leg muscles, your back muscles and the rest of your core (abs, chest, shoulders)\\n* Maybe do a shorter backpacking trip to get used to carrying the weight prior to the big trip
Your ideal weight range is between 98 and 123 lbs. You can check it here\\nhttp://www.healthstatus.com/calculate/iwc\\n\\nYou are obviously underweight. Since you talk about very fast metabolism, do you have problems tolerating hot weather, or sweat a lot or have palpitations? These are all features of overactive thyroid and there are many more.\\n\\nThe second question is have you been well without any health problems because certain illnesses can make you lose weight.\\n\\nThirdly, there are people who have fear of eating or obsessed with weight loss such as anorexia.\\n\\nAll three options need a chat with a doctor. If all is well, after the check up then a dietitian or nutritionist or the doctor can point you in the right direction

You need to speak to a librarian at a medical college. Libraries will have several related journals and a librarian can give you some insight into which of the journals are preferred and respected. It may be that some journals are more authoritative on certain topics than others -- A librarian should know that.
The important thing when dealing with paying off your old debt is to be CERTAIN that any negative report is removed from your credit history.  Just saying it's "paid in full" means nothing when it also says it was in collections or late payments.\\n\\nBefore you pay a dime on you debt, be sure the creditor agrees IN WRITING to remove the listing from your history.  Once they have your money it's not likely they will work with you.\\n\\nBy the way, if the creditor tells you it's illegal for them to do it, they are lying.  Read the Fair Credit Reporting act, and the Fair and Accurate Reporting Act.  There is noting in there preventing a creditor from removing their listings!
I'd try graphic design, visual arts, take some courses in Japanese culture[hey it couldn't hurt ;-D] and anything that teaches you how to capture the feelings of real people, real things in a stylized manner would get you there.  \\nI'm sure you don't need to major in anything.  you need to have a background in creative writing or just be creative enough that a publisher like Viz wants to buy your stuff.  the same thing will apply to the visual aspect.

This may sound crazy, but if you are religious you must believe in a religion, but if you are atheistic you do not have to believe in science.  An atheist does not have to believe in anything.
Kung Fu is the general term that refers to all Chinese martial arts. It is also pronounced "gong fu" in the southern provinces (China is united through written language, not spoken!). The actual translation would roughly be "work", or "hard work", so it is not a very good label! I actually prefer to use the term "Chinese Boxing", and another answerer mentioned "Shaolin Boxing", which I suppose could be appropriate as well, but gives the impression of being directly related to Shaolin.\\nStance training, conditioning drills, weapons (long-range, mid-range, short-range, and projectile), striking, kicks, grappling, in-fighting, ground-fighting, and various types of stretches are all incorporated in training. The moves are many and varied.

Many people practice celibacy . Calibacy doesn't mean your a virgin . It is total choice and noone should preasure you into it . I firmly believe that everyone should practice it until they are married due to the fact that it would cut back teen pregnacie and unwanted pregnacie in and across the world . Celibacy is also the only way not to contract any type of sexual deiseases. Be true to your self and in knowing that it is a choice  and a safe choice . I know i would if someone would have told me about it when I was younger .

You could convert the whole thing to improper fractions, so 3 1/4 would be 13/4 and 1 3/4 would be 7/4. 13/4-7/4=6/4.  6/4 can be reduced to 3/2 which, converted to a mixed number, is 1 1/2.

It is NOT a stupid question.\\n\\nThe ONLY celebration which Jesus commanded his followers to keep is the yearly memorial of his death, which happens after sundown on the date corresponding to the 14th day of Nisan on the Jewish calendar.  This year it will be on April 12th.\\n\\nSee Luke 22:19 - "Also, he (Jesus) took a loaf, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying: “This means my body which is to be given in your behalf. KEEP DOING THIS IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME."
Look within yourself my son.  Our whole life is nothing but perception.  How do you see this "UN"-fortunate event.  Is it an omen of doom and gloom.

Only you can answer this question, grasshopper.  Only you know how this event makes you feel.

Hi,\\nAVG is one of the best; available from http://www.grisoft.com. The free version is good. I bought the "buy" version for 33 dollars US for two years. Use to have Norton, but uninstalled it, like AVG much, much better. There are "definitions" downloads almost every day. They do not wait to put them in one large file, like every two weeks. You can download them when they are ready, like 2 or 3 at the time.\\nI highly recommend AVG; works great on any windows system.
Americans have just lost the loyalty of American businessmen who would rather get filthy rich then show their patriotism by employing fellow Americans. I think the government needs to stop accepting payoffs and begin banning products produced by American companies who do not have their factories inside the USA, and who do not employ American citizens.
i studied a few different martial arts over the years, heres some things i found that helped:\\n\\nknuckle pushups - you want to keep your wrists strong in a fisted position, like you'd have once you've grabbed someone's gi, only let your first 2 knuckles touch the ground. \\n\\nregular pushups -  you want the muscles on the inside of your wrists strong too. after a while, mix it up with fingertip pushups too.\\n\\nsledgehammer spins - get a sledge hammer (20 pounds or more) with a handle thats 2 feet long. hold it out in front of you, and with one hand (or both) grip the very end of the handle (with the hammer itself down) and try to rotate it in a clockwise motion. then, try counterclockwise. you wont be able to do it, but see how high you can lift it. your entire arms and chest will probably go nuts after you do that a few times, this helps strengthen everything when you'd do any type of twisting movement for grappling or throws.\\n\\nhorse stance squats - open a door in your house so that the door is outward (not closed, not against a wall). now, put your back against the edge of the door, and in a horse stance, do squats. try to keep your back straight so that its against the door, which means your back is totally vertical, you're not leaning in any direction.\\n\\nsoup cans - get a few large cans of soup or veggies in your kitchen, hold them out at your sides with your arms straight. just see how long you can go. every few days, try to add 5 or 10 seconds. your shoulders will hate you, but it works well.\\n\\ngood luck!

Condoms are definitely NOT 100% safe against pregnancy or any STD's. They aren't 100% safe because they can break or slip off during intercourse or they can have a flaw (tiny hole) from when they were manufactured. People use them because they do offer some protection (very little protection against pregnancy), but they should be used in combination with other protection. =-)

Get Certain Dri. You will never sweat from your underarms. Eliminates all odor. Has no smell. Has no residue so it does not stain your clothes at all. It is a roll on you can get at any drug store in the anti-perspirant section. You put it on at night. Go to sleep. Wake up and take a shower. The residue of the anti-perspirant is gone, but you don't sweat or smell at all for a couple of days. And when I say you don't sweat or smell I mean it. I go to the gym and my shirt gets soaked except for under the arms. That is how well it works. I have not sweated under my arms for over ten years since starting to use this product, and nothing else was able to stop the sweat.
Negotiate with the creditor to lower your interest and ask for forgiveness of late fees etc that they might have charged.\\n\\nI have had late fees forgive a couple of times just for the asking.  \\n\\nNegotiate with every credit card you have, once you get a card witht he lowest interest transfer all balance to that card or as much as you can into that card.\\n\\nPay the card with highest interest rate first.  As soon as you pay it off, cut that card off and thrwo it in the trash.  RINSE and REPEAT\\n\\nAt the end you will have one credit card left and pay that off.\\n\\nAll this while you MUST refrain from using credit again or else it will not work.  Cash your paycheck and use cash/debit card for all your expenses.\\n\\nMake a list of things you purchase every month and find out where you can cut cost.  Don't goto movies for a year, dont eat out, buy generic groceries, skip vacation and take double pay.  \\n\\nThe best is use your tax refund to pay off your debt.  Since you are used to living without that money as soon as you get your refund before you spend it pay it all into your highest interest credit card.\\n\\nGood luck.

yes, soda is bad for you, but that doesn't stop most americans from drinking it.  Even diet soda is bad for you due to the carbonation, which causes bloating and gas and reduces calcium absorbtion thereby contributing to low bone density in some individuals, and the phenylketonurics (containing phenylalanine)used in the manufacture of some artificial sweeteners.
Your Gynecologist can remove it without you being embarrassed by a family doctor seeing your genital area. Otherwise a dermatologist is the best bet.
MY SON COMING INTO MY LIFE.  BEFORE I MET MY HUSBAND NOW I HAD BEEN WITH ALOT OF DIFFERENT GUYS.  WELL FOR 10 YEARS OF SLEEPING AROUND I NEVER GOT PREGNANT.  I METT MY HUSBAND NOW AND THE FIRST COUPLE TIMES OF US HAVING SEX I GOT PREGNANT.  THE MOMENT I FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT I QUIT SMOKING AND QUIT DRINKING.  I QUIT PARTYING AND I STARTED GOING BACK TO CHURCH AND I BECAME VERY SPIRITUAL.  I BELIEVE THAT HAVING MY SON SAVED MY LIFE.  I DON'T KNOW WHERE I WOULD BE IF I NEVER HAD HIM.  I THINK THAT GOD WANTED ME TO GET PREGNANT BECAUSE I NEEDED TO CHANGE MY LIFE AROUND FAST OR SOMETHING WAS GONNA HAPPEN TO ME.  BECAUSE I LOOK AT IT THIS WAY,  WHY DID I NOT EVER GET PREGNANT ALL THOSE OTHER TIMES HAVING SEX?  BUT ONCE I METT THIS MAN IM SUPPOSE TO BE WITH FOREVER I GET PREGNANT?  IT WAS JUST A SIGN. IT WAS SUPPOSE TO HAPPEN FOR SURE. SO, THAT WAS MY GREATEST MIRACLE AND BLESSING IN MY LIFE.  MY LIFE IS SOOOOO MUCH BETTER NOW WITH MY SON AND MY HUSBAND MY LIFE.  GOOD QUESTION.
Well if you were her true friend then you wouldn't make her choose. My best advice to you would be just to be there for her and support her until she realizes this guy isn't the one for her. In the long run she will see that she did you wrong and ask for your forgivness. Just stick by her side like you always have and be the greatest friend.
i know what song you are talking about but i don't know the name either..the best thing i can tell you to do is get a copy of home alone and when the start showing the credits towards the end of the movie (the very end too!)write down all the song titles and do a search on the web....that's how i find songs that i like from movies
Even though you feel singled out, rest assured that everyone is subjected to the values/morals of other people at various times in their lives.  Life isn't always fair.   And this unfairness learned through childhood will prepare you for the unfairness you will experience as an adult.  I'm not saying it's right.  I'm just trying to assure you that 'kids' aren't alone experiencing injustices.
Uncle Tom's Cabin is a novel by American abolitionist author Harriet Beecher Stowe which treats slavery as a central theme. The work was first published on March 20, 1852. The story focuses on the tale of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering African American slave, the central character around whose life the other characters—both fellow slaves and white slave owners—revolve. The novel dramatizes the harsh reality of slavery while also showing that Christian love and faith can overcome even something as evil as enslavement of fellow human beings.\\n\\nUncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel of the 19th century (and the second best-selling book of the century after the Bible)[1] and is credited with both helping to start the American Civil War and helping to fuel the abolitionist cause in the United States.\\n\\nDespite these positive effects, the book also helped create and spread common stereotypes about African Americans, many of which endure to this day. Among the stereotypes in the book include the affectionate, dark-skinned mammy; the pickanniny stereotype of black children; and the Uncle Tom, or dutiful, long-suffering servant faithful to his white master or mistress. In recent years, these negative associations with Uncle Tom's Cabin have to a large degree overshadowed the historical impact of the book.
In a real wire, the velocity is something less than the speed of light.  How much less depends on the permitivity and permiability of the medium that the wave is propagating through.  What you want to find out is the "Velocity Factor" or "Velocity of Propagation" of your wire.  \\nAs an example, standard RG6A Coax cable has a velocity factor of 0.66, which means that electricity travels through it at 66% of the speed of light.\\nHere is a list with example velocities of propagation for different wire types\\nhttp://www.nteinc.com/jovial/shortstop/voplist.html

NO WAY! She's an insult to women, a terrible role model for girls, and the perfect example of conspicuous consumption. Instead of partying and blowing money she should think about spending most of that cash on something that's meaningful.She probably has no trouble sleeping at night because she's a spoiled brat without a conscience, but I wouldn't be able to stand myself.
Now if your looking for a good way to raise money, I suggest you have some type of event on the par 3's.  One that seems to do well is having six holes in one green.  You put them all in the same area, make sure they are set up with flags.  The person pays $5.00 and wins a prize if they make birdie.  They get to chose which hole when they putt to.  Since you are going to ride around you could make a list of fines.  Any person or group you catch in the rough, hazard or what ever has to pay a fine of X.  That may be the best way to do it without making up rules that will change the results.
If you had imaging studies (specifically ultrasound), and the cysts are truely simple cysts and had none of the nine malignant characteristics, that sounds right. We make cysts in all kinds of parts of our bodies (liver, kidney, breast, ovaries to name a few). Cysts are simply fluid filled sacs. They are not cancerous in almost ALL cases. The only time a doctor will remove a cyst is if it is causing you pain or if it doesn't look like a classical cyst on imaging. Cysts come and go. If you remove a cyst, you more than likely will grow more. Aspirating a cyst with a needle is an alternative, but in 50% of the time, the cyst will return. If you are not having pain, generally we leave cysts alone. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. \\n\\nI am unsure of the specifics of the woman, with breast cancer, who answered ahead of me.  I can tell you that simple breast cysts do not become cancer.  Someone who has breast cysts can develop breast cancer, but that is unrelated to the cysts.  Anyone can get breast cancer, and having breast cysts does not raise your risks.\\n\\nHere is some things from the "experts":\\n\\n"Benign breast disease is a large group of non-cancerous conditions of the breast that includes cysts, fibroadenomas, and hyperplasia. Of all the types of benign breast disease, only hyperplasia is related to breast cancer."\\n\\nhttp://www.yourdiseaserisk.harvard.edu/hccpquiz.pl?func=show&quiz=breast&page=risk_list\\n\\n"Virtually all breast cysts identified as “simple cysts” by ultrasound are benign and remain so. It is estimated that perhaps 1 in 1,000 cysts may harbor a tumor (not necessarily malignant). These can usually be identified by their ultrasound appearance. Women with cysts are not at greater risk for the development of cancer although this risk may be minimally elevated if there is a positive family history for breast cancer (mother, sister, daughter)."\\n\\nhttp://www.cpmc.org/services/women/breast/breast_cyst.html

The first US troops actually entered Iraq in September of 1942 to fly P-39 Aircobras to the Soviets as part of the "lend-lease" program in WWII,then US special forces in 1984 to help train Hussien's Republican Guard against the Irainians, then in March of 1991 ground troops for Operation Desert Storm, but as far as Operation Iraqi Freedom, it was March of 2003.

Yes it was Abbot and Cosstello\\n\\nAbbott: Well Costello, I'm going to New York with you. You know Bucky Harris, the Yankee's manager, gave me a job as coach for as long as you're on the team.\\n\\nCostello: Look Abbott, if you're the coach, you must know all the players.\\n\\nAbbott: I certainly do.\\n\\nCostello: Well you know I've never met the guys. So you'll have to tell me their names, and then I'll know who's playing on the team.\\n\\nAbbott: Oh, I'll tell you their names, but you know it seems to me they give these ball players now-a-days very peculiar names.\\n\\nCostello: You mean funny names?\\n\\nAbbott: Strange names, pet names...like Dizzy Dean...\\n\\nCostello: His brother Daffy.\\n\\nAbbott: Daffy Dean...\\n\\nCostello: And their French cousin.\\n\\nAbbott: French?\\n\\nCostello: Goofè.\\n\\nAbbott: Goofè Dean.

Sometimes his wife comes down and collects it.\\n\\nCostello: Whose wife?\\n\\nAbbott: Yes.\\n\\nPAUSE\\n\\nAbbott: What's wrong with that?\\n\\nCostello: Look, all I wanna know is when you sign up the first baseman, how does he sign his name?\\n\\nAbbott: Who.\\n\\nCostello: The guy.\\n\\nAbbott: Who.\\n\\nCostello: How does he sign...\\n\\nAbbott: That's how he signs it.\\n\\nCostello: Who?\\n\\nAbbott: Yes.\\n\\nPAUSE\\n\\nCostello: All I'm trying to find out is what's the guy's name on first base.\\n\\nAbbott: No. What is on second base.\\n\\nCostello: I'm not asking you who's on second.\\n\\nAbbott: Who's on first.\\n\\nCostello: One base at a time!\\n\\nAbbott: Well, don't change the players around.\\n\\nCostello: I'm not changing nobody!\\n\\nAbbott: Take it easy, buddy.\\n\\nCostello: I'm only asking you, who's the guy on first base?\\n\\nAbbott: That's right.\\n\\nCostello: Ok.\\n\\nAbbott: All right.\\n\\nPAUSE\\n\\nCostello: What's the guy's name on first base?\\n\\nAbbott: No. What is on second.\\n\\nCostello: I'm not asking you who's on second.\\n\\nAbbott: Who's on first.\\n\\nCostello: I don't know.\\n\\nAbbott: He's on third, we're not talking about him.\\n\\nCostello: Now how did I get on third base?\\n\\nAbbott: Why you mentioned his name.\\n\\nCostello: If I mentioned the third baseman's name, who did I say is playing third?\\n\\nAbbott: No. Who's playing first.\\n\\nCostello: What's on first?\\n\\nAbbott: What's on second.\\n\\nCostello: I don't know.\\n\\nAbbott: He's on third.\\n\\nCostello: There I go, back on third again!\\n\\nPAUSE\\n\\nCostello: Would you just stay on third base and don't go off it.\\n

Belief in miracles is a concept. But faith in god an absolute necessity.\\n\\n\\nBefore we proceed discussion on miracles, we need to understand the meaning of miracles. What does it actually mean? What does actually happen when we hear someone say, "a miracle has happened"?\\n\\nThe famous Ganesha episode drinking the milk was the biggest miracle of all the times.\\n\\n\\nMiracles are not to be. No human being on earth can create a miracle. It can never happen. Yes, some people... some renowned Saints while pursuing their Spiritual career gain some Tantric powers which helps them healing the needy.\\n\\nIt so happened a poor man turned up in presence of Bhagwan Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism and asked him for help. In his hands was the dead body of his young son. He begged of Bhagwan Mahavira to put back life into his son. Mahavira point blank refused... he stated he does not have the power to put life into someone... neither it is possible for any other human being to do so. Neither he could perform even a single miracle.\\n\\n\\nHe repeatedly emphasized that every human being has the power within to invoke the positive energy of the Cosmos. This only happens when we develop a positive attitude towards life. This is practically what is being done in Reiki. Summing up in Reiki, one is taught to invoke the positive energy source and use it for curing the defective area of the body. It is like chanelising all the power within the means of human being towards a particular area as happens in the case of a dam.\\n\\nIn any hydroelectric project the principal means of generating energy is... a huge quantity of water is stored in a lake and this raw water is made to stand for a while. After the sedimentation of the particles floating in the water has occurred... the clear water is passed through tunnels, the starting point of which is located on a much higher platform than the outer end of the tunnel. This makes the water gush out with great pressure. This water is made to pass through a turbine before it reaches the outer end. The rotation of the turbine generates electricity.\\n\\n\\nMere channelising of water through a tunnel which has a very steep slope and keeping a turbine in the path of the water generates the requisite energy... similarly if we need to heal our body... we need to concentrate all the positive energies which either exist in the body or can be invoked from the mighty reservoir of Cosmos and directed towards a particular goal. This goal can be healing the ailing body or even pursuing a higher goal in life.\\n\\nIf we look at the matter deeply... the student who comes first in the class and the student who comes last... there is not much difference except in their thinking. The one who comes first sincerely concentrates his total energies towards the desired goal of life. The one coming last has yet to find a definite goal in life. One who comes last fritters away his energy to no avail.\\n\\n\\nWhenever we expect of a saint to perform a miracle... what actually happens is that the words of the saint inspires us and makes us concentrate our energies towards a particular goal. Sometimes, he gives a Mantra to be chanted many times... or explains logically how the desired results can be achieved. Repetition of Mantras results in invoking positive energy from the Cosmos.\\n\\nYou and your brother have surrounded your mental self by negative energies... both of you have a habit of thinking negative. You have to change your attitude towards life... you need to think broad... you just cannot continue being narrow-minded. The more we think bad of someone... the negative flow of energy reflects back upon us. With passage of time this negative energy accumulates and there comes a time when hell breaks loose... the body unable to sustain the negative flow of energy falls ill.\\n\\n\\nThe moment you understand this crux of life... you shall never need a miracle ever. You have within you the mightiest source of energy in the Cosmos.
No, time is dependant on your frame of reference according to Einstiens theory of relativity.  The Twins paradox demonstrates this well.  A pair of twins, both born on the same day.  One remains on Earth, the other blasts off in a space ship travelling at 70% of the speed of light.  The space explorer returns after what appears to be one year in space but upon landing finds that the other twin has long since died of old age, so has all his friends.  Time slows down the closer you get to the speed of light.  It also slows down the closer you get to large gravity wells like black holes.
Charles's Law states that the volume of a given amount of dry ideal gas is directly proportional to the Kelvin Temperature provided the amount of gas and the pressure remain fixed.\\n\\nV1 / T1 = V2 / T2\\n\\nWhen the three parameters, temperature, volume and pressure are not constant, you can use the relatio P1V1/T1=P2V2/T2 Whenever either of the parameters is constant, just cancel it out and you can get the relationship between the remaining variables.

I am sorry for your dilemma. My son had been sick as an infant and had to use a nebulizer for awhile.\\n\\nI think you cannot ask them to not smoke in their own home. You can however, not allow him to go over there. You as his mother have a responsibility to protect your child. Your husband should be backing you in protecting his son. Even if they quit smoking when he is there, the fact that they smoked in the room BEFORE he got there is going to affect him too. \\n\\nIt's affecting your child's life. How can your husband not see this?  I don't understand it. I hope he sees the light soon. Your son is suffering from it.
For me it was my grandmother.  She was 76 when I was born and almost 87 when she died.  She had Alzheimer's, although in 1975 they did not use that term - it was just 'senile' then, and had to live the last four years of her life with constant care in a nursing home.  I visited her three times a week and even though she didn't have her mind I think she always knew who I was because even though she didn't verbalize at that point she always got upset when my father (her son) visited without me (he stopped every day on his way into work).\\n\\nWhen I visited my grandmother I noticed the many other men and women in the home who did not have anyone visiting them.  Being the young child I was I started visiting them too so that when I went I had my 'rounds' to make.\\n\\nIt caused a lot of happiness in these people to be remembered even if it was only by a small child who was not biologically connected to them in any way.  It taught me a lesson in love that to this day I will never forget.  It also taught me that every human life has value and should never be forgotten.\\n\\nI am thankful for the lesson that that experience has taught me.
SCAD (as the locals call it) is a great school with a great reputation located in a beautiful city.  If you can afford it (which can be a big if, because it is very expensive), you would probably love it and get a great education.  A friend of mine went there, and be warned, the workload is not light at all.  They have now opened a SCAD center in downtown Atlanta that is also very nice if you are not tied to Savannah.
A girl's parents die and she gets sent to live with an old rich uncle whose wife has died. Her cousin is "ill" and told that he will never be able to walk. She discovers a hidden garden that used to be the wife's, and she teachers the boy that he can walk and that he isn't really so sick after all.\\n\\nWhy is this in the gay category?\\n\\nAnd then a lot of things happend.

Bad items fall off after 7 years, except bankruptcies, which fall off after 10.  It is supposed to be automatic but the credit reporting agencies (CRAs) aren't as vigilant about doing this as they should be, so check your credit report and if there's something on there that shouldn't be, write a letter demanding it be removed to all 3 of the CRAs and follow that up with phone calls to each one to make sure it gets done.

I'm going to forego the assumption that everyone else has made regarding the status of your marriage and simply answer your question.\\n\\nThe short answer is no, there isn't currently a way to track your wife through your Acura TL navigation system.  However, several cellular phone companies offer GPS and for $9.99/mo. you can locate a cell phone user through services such as "Family Locator" through Sprint,  "Xora", "eTrace" and other applications through Nextel; and I'm sure other carriers are offering something similar.\\n\\nAs an aside, vehicles equipped with OBDIII (On-Board Diagnostics 3) have GPS tracking systems integrated into your cars ECM which will allow government agencies to track your location, speed, and even get updated data about the condition of your car (last time you had it serviced, for example).  With this technology they will be able to issue you a speeding ticket without even seeing you, or shut-down your car remotely if you don't pay your overdue parking tickets, etc.  The latest Chevy Corvette already has it.  Check it out for yourself...

Not only was I tempted to, but I fell into it. And hopefully you can learn from my passed sin  . IT'S NOT WORTH  IT !!!!   When we get tempted,we are blinded to all the consequences that follow. And believe me, there will be consequences .. but here is the good news.. Being tempted is not a sin .. resist the devil and he will flee from you . trust me, you will be greatly disappointed in the end,with unbelievable heartache . \\nIt is the Christians duty to cast  down those imaginations that exault themselves above God and bring them into the obedience and captivity of Jesus .. Shut the thoughts down, and replace them with God's word .. Lord Bless you ....\\n\\nemotional closeness can very well lead to physical . The devil knows how to set that up like nobodies business .   he will do what ever he can to acomplish his goal .

As long as there is no stipulation that the card is non-transferrable, you can try to sell it on ebay.  My guess is that you won't get anywhere near the cash value of it because it's insanely rare that anyone gets gift certificates for that large an amount especially on groceries. You will then be further limited to hoping to find a buyer among the people who have access to that particular grocery store or chain.\\n\\nThere are also a few websites where you can sell gift cards or exchange them for gift cards to other stores and although they were discussed in the news for a while, a great number of people still don't know they exist so again, you'd be hoping for a buyer from a small scross section of people.\\n\\nWith a certificate that large, in my opinion, the only way you can get the best value out of it is to just use it yourself over time until it runs out.

story from little box:-\\n\\nIt's meaningful....\\n\\nOnce upon a time, there was a teacher and his student lying down under a big tree near a big grass area. Then, suddenly, the student asked the teacher,\\n\\nStudent : Teacher, I'm confused, how can we find our soul-mate? Could you please help me?\\n\\nTeacher : (Silent for few second, than he answered)\\n\\nWell, it's a pretty hard and easy question.\\n\\nStudent : (Thinking hard) Huh???\\n\\nTeacher : Look on that way, there are a lot of grass there, why don't you walk there but please never walk backward, just walk straight ahead. On your way, try to find a beautiful grass and pick it up then give it to me. But just one.\\n\\nStudent : Well, ok then... wait for me... (walked straight ahead to the grass field).\\n\\nA few minutes later...\\n\\nStudent : I'm back.\\n\\nTeacher : Em, well I don't see any beautiful grass on your hand.\\n\\nStudent : On my journey, I found few beautiful grass, but I thought that I would find a better one, so I didn't pick it up. But I didn't realize that I'm at the end of the field, and I hadn't picked up any. Because you told me not to go back, so I didn't go back.\\n\\nTeacher : That's what happened in real life.\\n\\nWhat is the message of this story?\\n\\n* Grass - is people around you\\n* Beautiful Grass - is people that attract you\\n* Grass Field - is time\\n* In looking for your soulmate, please don't always\\ncompare and hope that there will be a better one.

That depends on how you define the word "computer."\\n\\nA succession of steadily more powerful and flexible computing devices were constructed in the 1930s and 1940s, gradually adding the key features of modern computers, such as the use of digital electronics (invented by Claude Shannon in 1937) and more flexible programmability. Defining one point along this road as "the first computer" is exceedingly difficult. Notable achievements include the Atanasoff-Berry Computer, a special-purpose machine that used valve-driven (vacuum tube) computation, binary numbers, and regenerative memory; the secret British Colossus computer (1944), which had limited programmability but demonstrated that a device using thousands of valves could be made reliable and reprogrammed electronically; the American ENIAC (1946) — which was one of the first general purpose machine, but still used the decimal system and incorporated an inflexible architecture that meant reprogramming it essentially required it to be rewired and Konrad Zuse's Z machines, with the electromechanical Z3 (1941) being the first working machine featuring automatic binary arithmetic and feasible programability.

It was pretty clear from the fact that you have asked this twice that you did not get the answer that you were looking for so here is my try !!!\\n\\nThe First Answers on the other question were good, but doppler was made a little bit clearer when put to me like this.When applied to Sound Waves.  Have you heard a train horn coming toward you then away from you? The same horn at first sounds higher in frequency as the waves are compressing together in front of the train. Then as it passes, goes away the same horn sounds lower in frequency because now the waves are stretching out, reaching us at a lower rate per second this is the doppler effect.  I only say a train because it is the only vehicle that usually single=horned you can hear clearly like this.  A car passing if it blows it's horn will create the same effect and do the exact same thing. It's just not so noticeable.\\n\\nDoppler is how the Police catch you speeding! The early radar units were actually calibrated by the officers in the field using the back and forth motion of a common music tuning fork! (The back and forth motion of a certain note represented a certain specific MPH).\\n\\nDoppler really only refers to the change of frequency reflected from the target. If it is higher, then the target is coming toward the receiving antenna. If it is lower in frequency, the target is going away from the receiving antenna. The more the frequency shift, the faster the movement. \\n\\nConventional radar only shows the return signal, and does not measure its frequency shift from that which was transmitted.\\n\\nHope this helps you.\\n\\nThats basic Doppler 101\\n\\nThere is a Display (if it is a Weather type Radar) , a Transmitter / Receiver ,  Waveguide ( looks like square hollow copper tubing, conducts the radar signal ), Feed Horn (connects waveguide to antenna)  Parabolic Antenna ( Focus signal into Feed Horn)\\n\\nBy the wayI just remembered in the days of space travel and satelites.  When we tune in satelites the frequencies change as the satelite moves due to this doppler effect.  Now during re-entry when speeds are greater the shifts are noticeable.  And you can actually tell a difference from a ground station on the same frequency!\\n\\nOh yeah by the way no big problems with doppler,  except that some operator could aim the darn thing wrong I guess and single out the wrong vehicle for speeding.  Guess he would be cross eyed!!!  Mistakes happen in just about every thing that is done everywhere!  But doppler is very accurate people make mistakes.  Some few Police are true JERKS most are just humans doing their job and are actually well meaning people trying to save lives!!!!  If you feel you are unfairly stopped for speeding, now I mean you were really NOT speeding, calmly talk to the officer and just see what he can do for you.  Explain Just BE CALM the worst thing will be he will give you the ticket!  The best he will give you a warning!  DO NOT ARGUE WITH HIM! Be sympathetic!  It will work.  OR HE IS A JERK!\\n\\nI AM NOT A JERK, AND I HAVE CARRIED A BADGE!\\n\\nHey have a good day. Hope I have helped you in some way!!\\n\\nOH YEA ... " DRIVE CAREFUL HEAR "\\n\\nAPS

Pierre Trudeau is certainly the Prime Minister who is most remembered and brought about a great deal of positive change - a multicultural, tolerant, understanding, bi-lingual society, good protection of our health care system, and repatriation of the constitution while maintaining good relations with Great Britain.  He greatly valued education and supported post secondary studies.  He is also remembered for the strong stand he took when he enacted the War Measures Act.  His phrase, "Just watch me" is often quoted.  Pierre Trudeau was a true statesman, something we have not seen in prime ministers since him.  Paul Martin and Stephen Harper do not even come close to having the statesmanship, diplomacy, integrity, resolution or just plain charisma of Pierre Trudeau.  He will go down in history as one of Canada's greatest.\\n\\nTo choose a runner up to Pierre Trudeau it would have to be either Lester Pearson who won a Nobel Peace Prize, or John A. MacDonald, one of the fathers of Confederation.

Here is a site that discusses the Myths and Facts surrounding giving blood.\\n\\nhttp://www.lebanonredcross.org/Give_Blood_Facts.htm\\n\\nPeople should not donate blood if their lifestyles put them at risk for HIV, hepatitis B, malaria or other infections that can be transmitted through blood. \\n\\nBeing a Homosexual CAN put you in this risk category if the partners involved are NOT monogomous.  The Red Cross defers acceptance of blood from donors in this risk group.. even those in monogomous relationships.  IV drug users, being a or using prostitutes for sexual intercourse are other donor-risk behaviors.\\n\\nOther factors that would bar you from giving blood include: \\n\\n** You have had a recent tattoo.  \\n\\n **You or someone in your family has or had Creuzfeldt-Jakob disease. \\n\\n** You had an injection of beef insulin made from cattle in the United Kingdom.  \\n\\n **You recently had malaria.  \\n\\n **You have lived in the United Kingdom for more than three months or in Europe for more than six months anytime after 1980.  \\n\\n **You have been treated for syphilis or gonorrhea in the last year.\\n\\nAbout Blood Donation:\\n\\nBlood Facts:  http://www.miblood.org/about_blood/facts.html\\n\\nThe average adult has about 10 pints of blood in his or her body. \\n\\nThe Need For Blood \\n\\n4.5 million Americans would die each year without life saving blood transfusions. \\nOn average, about 38,000 pints of blood are used each day in the United States. \\nEvery three seconds someone needs blood. \\nOn average, one out of every 5 hospital patients will need blood. \\nAbout three gallons of blood supports the entire nation's blood needs for one minute. \\nBlood centers often run short of type O and B blood. \\nThe average red blood cell transfusion is 3.4 pints. \\n\\nHow Blood Helps\\n\\nOne unit of blood can be separated into several components (red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma, platelets and cryoprecipitate). \\nJust one pint of donated blood can help 3-4 people.

The quality of education is hampered because teachers are now being asked to teach children the social skills that families used to promote.  Unfortunately, as a teacher, all too many times I have to deal with issues that have absolutely nothing to do with what I want to teach my kids.  Children's behavior stymies the amount and quality of teaching that goes on every day.  When reflecting upon what the major cause for this, I always go back to the lack of caring many parents have towards their child's education.  Our society has fallen into the "it's all about me" syndrome, and parents aren't doing their part.  Our government is now working at holding the schools accountable for what is taught and the academic success of the students attending, but until parents are held just as accountable, then our schools (especially those in the urban arenas) are going to continue to struggle.  Thanks for the question Joe.

The Congress is made up of two parts, called houses.  The Senate is the upper house and each state has 2 senators.  The lower house of the Congress is the House of Representatives. It is larger than the Senate because the number of representatives from each state depends on the state's population and is not set at a specific number.  Each house of Congress has varying responsibility and rights.  So, in short, the Senate is just one half of the Congress.

The Bible also mentions somewhere that the Earth will be "renewed", that heaven will be on Earth, I think
I sure do, especially when they make excuses. I read an answer here on that neocon pastor and his male prostitute: "The closer to God you are, the more the devil tries to get you" or something like that. Anyone not a Christian who does the same is just evil to them, but when it's a Christian, they point at the devil.
As a guy, I have experience in this.  When women talk, they are talking in a different language.  In my experience, women beat around the bush.  I don't know what kind of hints you are dropping but you need to be up front, direct. Give him some hints of what would be nice.  He may not realize what you are hinting to.  I know I never had a clue when I was being hinted to.  It took me several years.  Go to the book store and get Men are from Mars and Woman are from Venus.  It says allot.  I think I is a great book.  I am sure that there are several books that give you a little more insight on the male mind but that is a good start.  DON"T GIVE UP ON HIM.  Both of you need to sit down and discuss things keeping an open mind and promising that no matter what is said, you won't take offense to it.  It needs to be a conversation that will bring the two of you closer, not a conversation that will drive a stake into either of your hearts.  It is easy to think someone is picking up on your hints.....but sometimes the hints go unnoticed.  Good luck and don't give up. Have a honest conversation.  I have always said one thing to women I have tried to date.  "Tell me the good truth, tell me the bad truth, just tell me the truth".  I know I am a big boy and I would rather be hurt a little now than a lot later.  By the way, I am 38, in case you were wondering.   Mike
This is not a mathematics question .. as there is no condition given .. however, I estimate it based on the following assumptions:\\n\\n1. More you go up, temp will fall.\\n2. While travelling by air, (at 35,000 feet) outside temperature is around - 15 degree celcious. (this might vary from place to place and season to season though)\\n3. Assume the temperature at ground level (altitude = 0) 30 degree celcious (this will vary from place to place though)\\n\\nnow we have two points\\n\\naltitude = 0, temp = 30 degree celcious\\naltitude = 35,000 feet, temp = - 15 degree celcious\\n\\nso for an altitude difference of 35,000 feet temp drops by 45 degree celcious\\n\\nThe rough estimate could be done like this:\\n\\nfor 10,000 feet altitude difference, temp will fall by (45/35000)*10000 or 12.85 degree. So temp at 10,000 feet altitude will be 17.15 degree celcious\\n\\nfor 15,000 feet altitude difference, temp will fall by (45/35000)*15000 or 19.28 degree. So temp at 15,000 feet altitude will be 10.72 degree celcious\\n\\nfor 24,000 feet altitude difference, temp will fall by (45/35000)*24000 or 30.86 degree. So temp at 24,000 feet altitude will be -0.86 degree celcious\\n\\nfor 30,000 feet altitude difference, temp will fall by (45/35000)*30000 or 38.57 degree. So temp at 30,000 feet altitude will be -8.57 degree.

A heated object in contact with another object....like metal transfers its energy to the object.\\n\\nThis happens on the atomic scale. Rapidly oscillating atoms of the heated object in turn agitate and increase the energy of the other (metal).\\n\\nThe heated one cools a little and the metal heats a little....depending on how hot it is, what their sizes are and so on.\\n\\nIt's like....if you and a buddy get on a trampoline. You're on one side and he's on the other. He stands still and you start jumping up and down in a rhythm. Soon he will start bouncing up and down as well because the trampoline transfers your energy to him.\\n\\nKind of like that.\\n\\nUsually metals that conduct electricity are good conductors of heat as well.

The difference in relative size of one body part with respect to another (generally speaking, with respect to body size) is called allometry (from allos "different" + metro "measurement"). And from a developmental viewpoint, it is determined by differences in growth rate between those parts, or in the onset or offset of the growth period (collectively known as heterochronies). \\nThose differences may be directly coded in the person's DNA (especially in the general developmental homeotic genes) but can also arise from interaction among tissues and chemical signals between cells during growth. And in the case of abnormal size, there can be problems of embryonic development, hormones or others involved.

Laura's suggestion is interesting.  I'm sure it works for some but personally I hate when people ask me lots of questions in order to make conversation.  Therefore I also avoid asking others too many questions because you never know when you're hitting a sore spot.  Like "what do you do"?  They could have just been laid off, or my favorite: people ask me if I have kids, and since we've been trying for awhile and not yet succeeded, it is a painful question to be asked.  Anyway, so I try to avoid asking questions and instead I make conversation based on sharing the present moment with the person.  The most classic is commenting on the weather, or if we're at a party, "hey, i like this music", or "the food's really good".  I find this usually creates a natural comfort level when i share about the present experience with the person because that is what is usually on peoples' mind that very moment. I used to have a lot of problems with this, and read something about grounding oneself, using our five senses to experience our surroundings.  Usually when we allow ourselves to just "BE" instead of feeling anxiety about what we will say, it comes more naturally to talk, because thoughts just pop in our head.  Like if i'm just "BEING" i may notice something around me and naturally say it to the person next to me, like, "that baby is so cute", or "look at that gorgeous sunset"... I find people usually respond to this natural way of expressing oneself.\\n\\nHope this helps. it's helped me, but takes practice. I'm sure you also know there are many books out there about socializing so you may want to check out your local library too.\\n \\nGood Luck.

There have been other reports to that effect.  The White House had no comment to the Washington Post when asked about the Ha'aretz story, which is a strong hint that they could not deny it.  I'll see if I can find sources for you.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Bush has made similar statements about being specifically guided by God.  He told Bob Woodward that he doesn't have to pay attention to his father, the ex-President's advice, because he answers to a higher Father.\\n\\nAnd here are more reports: Earlier, Jackson Lears in the New York Times reported Bush as saying, "''Events aren't moved by blind change and chance''..., but by ''the hand of a just and faithful God.'' From the outset he has been convinced that his presidency is part of a divine plan, even telling a friend while he was governor of Texas, ''I believe God wants me to run for president.'' This conviction that he is doing God's will has surfaced more openly since 9/11. In his State of the Union addresses and other public forums, he has presented himself as the leader of a global war against evil. As for a war in Iraq, ''we do not claim to know all the ways of Providence, yet we can trust in them.'' God is at work in world affairs, he says, calling for the United States to lead a liberating crusade in the Middle East, and ''this call of history has come to the right country.''"  (http://bushwatch.org/evangelist.htm -- a biased site, but the quotes are accurately attributed)
In its original meaning it comes from the US military immediately following WWI. Strangely though, the term was never used to describe anyone - only in order to deny that any such servicemen existed. This bulletin was issued by the U.S. Command on Public Information in March 1919, on behalf of Major General M. W. Ireland, the U.S. Surgeon General:\\n\\n"The Surgeon General of the Army ... denies ... that there is any foundation for the stories that have been circulated ... of the existence of 'basket cases' in our hospitals."\\n\\nThis bulletin was reported on in many U.S. newspapers at the time. Many of them also defined what was meant by 'basket case'. For example, this from the New York paper, The Syracuse Herald, Mar 1919:\\n\\n"By 'basket case' is meant a soldier who has lost both arms and legs and therefore must be carried in a basket.\\n\\nGiven that the term was originally reserved for incapacitated servicemen, there wasn't much call for it until the next major war of English-speaking peoples - WWII. Again, it comes from the U.S. military and again in the form of a denial from the Surgeon General. In May 1944, in 'Yank', the then Surgeon General, Major General Norman T. Kirk, said:\\n\\n"... there is nothing to rumors of so-called 'basket cases' - cases of men with both legs and both arms amputated."\\n\\nClearly, given the scale of the casualties in both wars, there must have been cases of multiple amputation. It isn't recorded what term the U.S. Surgeon General used to describe these - clearly not 'basket case'.

Ditto for sneaker-making kids in Singapore. Before you go thinking I'm crazy, consider this: from 1750 to 1800(the advent of industrialism in England), the child mortality rate in London dropped 70%. I don't expect you to believe that, I expect you to check the facts yourself. In other words, John Bull saved the lives of many poor people. Isn't it better to work in a loud, dangerous machine shop, than to die of starvation? Also, if it weren't for the factories, there'd be no Labor party. Factory jobs lifted generations of people out of poverty and into the law-making middle class. In this case, the end is a better standard of living, and the means are hard work. Nothing wrong there.
Well, first I'll eliminate teams I think that wont make the playoffs. The Vikings will most likely finish 8-8, the Falcons have dug themselves a hole and I think its too deep to get out of, the Eagles arent contenders without McNabb, and the Niners have their three toughest games on the road with 5 games left. \\n\\nSo I see the Rams, Panthers/Saints, and Giants battling for the NFC wildcards.\\n\\nWith the way the Giants are playing right now, I dont see them standing much of a chance with their tough schedule left. If they get back to playing Giant football and come out and beat Dallas next week, theyre right back in the mix. If they lose that game, count them out.\\n\\nThe Rams have been choking, but might have saved their season yesterday vs the Niners. I see them going 4-1 in their final 5 games and clinching a spot in the playoffs at 9-7.\\n\\nI think Carolina will actually finish 10-6 as well as the Saints and end up winning the tie breaker over the Saints. Giving the Saints the other wild card.\\n\\nAs for Seattle, Shaun has to get back on the horse and get some yards to help Hassleback get into a groove. If Shaun and Hassleback are banged up like they have been all season, I wouldnt be suprise if they ended up forfeiting the NFC West to St.Louis or San Fran and missing out of the playoffs.

The problem is that this (Fourteenth Amendment)has been misinterpreted in recent years to mean simply that anyone born in the U.S, under any circumstances, is an American citizen.\\nThis is neither the original intent of the law nor the way it was interpreted by the courts in subsequent decades. Some Americans speak of birthright citizenship as if it were an immutable law of nature. \\nIt is not, and most other nations do not, in fact, recognize it. It is only a BAD HABIT that could be broken with a simple Executive Order. \\n\\nAccording to estimates, some 200,000 so-called anchor babies are born in the United States every year. \\nOnce a mother has birthed a child on American soil, she can then seek to obtain citizenship for herself on the strength of the family-reunification laws. \\nEven before this happens, she is very hard to deport, as the mother of an American, and the full panoply of welfare benefits is available to her, as is affirmative action if she is a member of a racial minority.\\n\\nA group of attorneys and immigration experts that is trying to do something about the problem RIGHT NOW. \\n\\nCraig Nelsen, director of Friends of Immigration Law Enforcement Stated :\\n"The situation we have today is absurd,There is a huge and growing industry in Asia that arranges tourist visas for pregnant women so they can fly to the United States and give birth to an American. This was not the intent of the Fourteenth Amendment; it makes a mockery of citizenship."\\n(Sound Familiar??)\\n\\nThe key to undoing the current misinterpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment is this odd phrase\\n\\n"AND SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION THEREOF."\\n\\nThe whole problem is caused by the fact that the meaning of this phrase, which was clear to anyone versed in legal language in 1868, has slipped with changes in usage. Fortunately, there is a large group of court precedents that make clear what the phrase actually means: \\n\\nThe Fourteenth Amendment EXCLUDES the children of aliens. (The Slaughterhouse Cases (83 U.S. 36 (1873)) \\n\\nThe Fourteenth Amendment draws a distinction between the children of aliens and children of citizens. (Minor v. Happersett (88 U.S. 162 (1874))\\n\\nThe phrase "subject to the jurisdiction" REQUIRES "Direct And Immediate ALLEGIENCE" to the United States, NOT just physical presence. \\n(Elk v. Wilkins 112 U.S. 94 (1884)) \\n\\nThere is NO automatic birthright citizenship in a particular case. (Wong Kim Ark Case, 169 U.S. 649 (1898)) \\n\\nThe Supreme Court has NEVER confirmed birthright citizenship for the children of illegal aliens, temporary workers, and tourists. \\n(Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 211 n.10 (1982)) \\n\\nThere are other cases referring to minor details of the question.\\n\\nThe so-called 14th amendment was never properly ratified either. \\nIn the case of Dyett v. Turner, 439 P.2d 266, 270 (1968), the Utah Supreme Court recited numerous historical facts proving, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that the so-called 14th amendment was likewise a major fraud upon the American People.\\n\\nThose facts, in many cases, were Acts of the several State Legislatures voting for or against that proposal to amend the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Law Library has a collection of references detailing this major fraud.\\n\\nThe U.S. Constitution requires that constitutional amendments be ratified by three-fourths of the several States. As such, their Acts are governed by the Full Faith and Credit Clause in the U.S. Constitution. See Article IV, Section 1.\\n\\nJudging by the sheer amount of litigation its various sections have generated, particularly Section 1, the so-called 14th amendment is one of the worst pieces of legislation ever written in American history. \\nThe phrase “subject to the jurisdiction of the United States” is properly understood to mean “subject to the municipal jurisdiction of Congress.” \\n\\nFor this one reason alone, the Congressional Resolution proposing the so-called 14th amendment is
sounds like your typical 14 yr old. They get that age and know it all. This is not always a bad thing. She is rebelling. Try some reverse psychology on her. Try acting like you dont care either. Plus, when she acts like this she is getting lots of attention from everyone telling her she should do it. Have everyone stop doing this and act as if they dont care if she goes or not. Have them talk with her about other aspects of her life. This will take the focus off of this and she will be more willing to go.  good luck

It's Jahn-Teller effect, not John Teller.\\n\\nJahn-Teller distortions occur for transition metal complexes where by distortion of the molecule can result in a lower energy state for the molecule.\\n\\nIn transition metal chemistry, bonds from ligands to the central metal atom are coordinate covalent, i.e. both electrons come from one atom.  The orbitals which contain those electrons bond with usually the dz2 and dx2-y2 orbitals from the metal, but are lower in energy, so the orbitals based on the metal are essentially anti-bonding orbitals.  The dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals are mostly non-bonding orbitals, but their energies do go up somewhat upon bonding interaction.  In a typical octahedral bonding arrangement, the dz2 and dx2-y2 are degenate, as are the dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals (they have the same energy).  In certain electron configurations (the classic example is d9), if the system can make those orbitals non-degenerate by lengthening or shortening bonding interactions along a certain axis, it can lower the overall energy by putting electrons in lower energy orbitals, which is why you will often see Cu2+ complexes where some bond distances are longer than others.

Well, obviously the people that have answered this are not thinking correctly and/or have never smoked marijuana in their lives.  I used to be an avid smoker and I still can't believe how naive people in this country are.  Not one person that answered mentioned alcohol and the fact that it is responible for thousandsn and thousands of deaths in this country every year.  People who smoke pot are not even close to being crackheads and whoever said that is an idiot.  I would much rather stumble upon 10 people who are stoned while walking down the street thatn 10 people who are drunk.  The latter of the above statements usually results into some kind of fight or people pissing all over the place or destroying something.  If you are going to be that person who is against the use of marijuana but condones the use or uses alcohol, needs to take a closer look at themselves.  Alcohol impairs your decision making a great deal, hence the amount of people who drive drunk.  When was the last time you heard of a peron who was stoned getting into a major accident and killing people?  I have yet to hear that story.  All legalizing pot would do is cut down on the amount of drug dealers that there are in this country.  If pot was legal, I would grow my own, and I'm sure that most people would.  Stop listening to things that people made up in the 60's and start living in the present.  Alcohol is bad and should be illegal.  Did you ever think of that?
I would not justify calling her a hypocrite. The only way she would be a hypocrite is if she was againts abortion, but having abortions of her own. It goes for smoking or drinking. Their is nothing wrong with her educating the public about her expierence. An example of this would be a person that smokes and tells another person that he/she shouldn't smoke. That person would be called a hypocrite. If the person quit for good then she would not be a hypocrite becouse she/he doesn't do it anymore.

Ignore the insulting answers. The reason you have difficulty with English is because in England we have very strong regional accents and even English people have difficulty understanding each other sometimes. The strongest accents are those in London (Cockney), Birmingham (Black Country). North East (Geordie). Devon and Cornwall (West Country), Liverpool (Scouse) and North (Lancashire and Yorkshire). For example in London the word 'Face' might sound like 'Fice', in Birmingham 'Time' will sound like 'toime' and 'tea' will sound like 'toy'. In Liverpool 'work' will sound like 'werk'. In the North East 'go down there' will come out as 'gan dan yan'. In the West Country 'I like that' would sound like 'Oi loike tha'. In Lancashire and Yorkshire the accent is very flat and letters left out so 'where are you going?' would come out as 'wer yer goin?'. Also lots of people now don't pronounce their words correctly, the most irritating example being the dropping of the letter 't' from words such as 'party' which sounds like 'par'y'. Also in some parts of the country they speak so that when they finish their sentences they use an upward inflection, like the Aussies, so that the sentence sounds almost like a question.\\n\\nBy the way I've visited Holland and it's a beautiful place. I enjoyed my stay there immensely and Amsterdam is a great city. The people there seemed to speak English better than most English people.

Yes, many times. It seems that I am the spiritual gatekeeper for the family. My grandmother visited me for a full six months after her passing; I finally had to ask her to stop since I wasn't getting any sleep because of it! The only two people in my entire family who have not made personal visits are my Dad's mother &, believe it or not, my Dad. I did see him once in connection with my mother's Dad & believe that I learned why I haven't been visited by him, alone, but am still not certain that I understood what was happening perfectly.\\n\\nIf this happens to you, try to go with the flow as it is a very powerful gift &, once your family understand that it happens to you, one that can bring a measure of peace to those who are grieving. Just don't be surprised if most people don't understand it or claim that they don't believe it as this is perfectly normal for those who have never had it happen to them personally.\\n\\nWhat has happened over the course of my life & losses is that my family - while some of them still don't fully believe that this happens to me - has come to be the realization that I am wise beyond my years. To clarify, there are things that I have said or done in relation to information that has been passed on to me that there is no other explanation for but, since some members of the family choose not to believe that I've been contacted, they pay respect to my talent by their belief that I am "wise".\\n\\nPersonally, I have learned to phrase anything I might say to the family in ways that tend to indicate that it could have been prior knowledge. This helps ease them into the idea that I know some things that they know fully well I shouldn't be aware of. I've learned to phrase what I know from contacts with the family who has passed in such a way as to present it as logical..."I wouldn't think that Grandma would - whatever - since she never liked - whatever..." This also helps to add information to the conversation & get the point across while not drawing attention to what I tend to call my "ether" knowledge.\\n\\nI don't really blame some of my family for having problems, however. After all, it is hard enough on one of my uncles that I now look exactly like his mother...add to this that my voice has the same timber, I have the same type of personality & such & it is easy to understand his issues with my other talents :) Poor man nearly fainted the first time I walked into his house & he saw me with glasses...\\n\\nEdited for Fred: Are you okay or are you intentionally rude because you have the strange idea that it is funny? Here's a newsflash for you: It isn't! If you can't answer a question in the vein it has been asked, please don't insult everyone involved by your rude comments! Thank you!

Someone who is hyer-ventilating must slow their breathing.\\n\\nTalk to him/her calmly.\\nTell them you know they feel like there's not enough air, but there really is, and they need to trust you.\\nHave them sit on a secure chair or bench, and lean forward with their elbows on their knees, and look at the ground.\\nTell them to try to match your breathing pattern.\\nThen YOU take steady, slow, deep breaths. In..2..3..., Out..2...3...4, In..2..3..., Out..2...3...4. Count softly out loud as you do this to help them focus.\\n\\nWhen they match your breathing for several breaths, start talking to them, in a calm, happy, way, about something you share with them that was fun. Try to get his/her mind off his/her breathing. \\n\\nSoon they'll be in the conversation, and not thinking about it either, and their breathing will normalize.\\n\\nIf the person does not calm down, and ends up fainting, their breathing will normalize anyway...but it is an awful experience. If they faint, make sure they don't hit their head on anything, lay them gently on their backs, prop their feet on something about 6 inches off the floor, and support their head with a flat pillow or folded small blanket. They should come around on their own, but if they are out for more than a couple of minutes, and you have smelling salts handy, give them a whiff or two. If you don't have smelling salts, a cool, wet washcloth placed gently against their cheeks may help wake them up. \\n\\nIf they fainted, once they are awake, take them to their doctor's office and have them check them over.

There are several ways to build tunnels underwater.\\n\\nOne way is to build sections of tubes in advance, float them into position using tugboats, sink them, have divers go down and seal the sections together, and then pump the water out.\\n\\nA more traditional way is to dig a tunnel far enough below the sea bottom that the rock over them keeps out the water.  It's kind of like digging a mine,\\n\\nIf the rock or soil isn't able to keep out all the water while the tunnel is being dug, sometimes it's possible to pump compressed air into the tunnel, so the pressure inside the tunnel is greater than the water pressure outside, and have workers seal the inside of the tunnel with a concrete or steel lining.

I think it will be a tough and gritty series for both teams. Having said that, England will be suffering for the lack of Simon Jones and Michael Vaughan, who were both key players last time. Also, the late loss of Tresco will damage their chances. Australia is a tough tour, and the hard pitches have a habit of taking their toll on visiting bowlers. Harmison and Flintoff are both recovering from injuries, but will need to bowl long spells which could take their toll.\\nHowever, the England team are young and enthusiastic, which will give them plenty of determination. They also have plenty of talent in KP, Flintoff, Strauss etc.\\nAustralia though, I feel, have just too much experience. Yourself, and Hayden, when you two get going build awesome platforms for the team to go onto big totals. Punter is in the best form of his life and has scored 1483 runs at 78 including 8 tons since the Ashes. If he gets going, We should be scoring 500+ scores. Then Hussey, well what a talent. Marto has a doubt but with Clarke and Jacques both pressing for a spot the middle should fire more than last year. Gilchrist doesn't even need a mention, except to say that Englands strategy of bowling around the wicket and moving it away shouldn't work as well in Oz as the extra bounce should give his the chance to cut and pull more often, which we all know he does with devestating effect. Brett Lee, McGrath and Warney will all fire up and do the job, and whoever gets the nod out of Watson, Clark, Tait or Johnson will be very keen to impress, and with the benefit of the extra bounce at home, the youngsters should bowl fast, and make life tough for England's inexperienced batsmen.\\nI think it will be closer than a lot of people back home will be thinking. I think the home crowds, and the conditions will just be a little too much for such a young inexperienced England team. Don't worry, there are plenty of Aussies over here in London who will be sitting up late at night and cheering you boys along, and we are taking the stick from the Poms for you, so get stuck in, good luck, and here's to a summer of runs for you boys.\\nAus to win 2-1.

These are easy to replace and you can call your computer maker (i.e. Dell/Gateway/HP, etc.) and get a replacement.\\n\\nIf it's an odd-brand or you don't have the specs, still, pull the darn thing out (taking note of where everything was plugged into) and drag it to a computer store, Radio Shack, Best Buy, etc.   You can get a new PowerSupply for like $30-60 bucks depending on what it is.\\n\\nTake it home, plug it in.  If it don't work, pull it back out and take it back (Gee, I'm sorry, my wife bought this for me 'cause she thought it was a CD Burner) ... ;-)\\n\\nPower supplies last about 2-4 years ... The best advice that I've given you is to yank it out and take it with you.  Power supplies are all different shapes and sizes (a finite number of standard ones), but you don't want to order something off of the internet that has all the same specs and is just 4" too tall to fit into your case !\\n\\nMy money's on your power supply.   BTW:  Did you check the fuse ?  Some older PC's have fuses.\\n\\nI hope this helps.  Don't be intimidated ... things only plug in one way ... when you're done and the CD don't work, open it back up and you'll be like, "Duh, I forgot to plug that in."    ;-)\\n\\nGood luck !\\n\\nP.S. (It's the power supply)
That's great that you developed a great relationship with the students, that just shows your great at what you do. But if a better opportunity if is offered you should take it. and it's similar in what you do. So you're right it will allow you to gain further experience. You can always visit the staff and children. I think you should take that opportunity and see what else is out there for you! Then you can build a relationship with the new staff and children. i definately think you should give it a try. you might just love it
Mutations is viral strains are highly exhibited when they are retroviruses such as HIV or the H5N1 strain. Such viruses do not have DNA initially, much simpler for them. An enzyme called Reverse Transcriptase transcribes DNA from RNA when these viruses invade host cells. However, these is a 'stupid' enzyme and it makes mistakes, and for every mistakes it makes, another strain is created due to mutation. For the influenza virus, this is such a trivial phenomenon. It happens almost all the time. But since viruses are relatively much less complicated than eukaryotes, an error usually does not prove fatal. For mammals, there is a smart enzyme called DNA polymerase which transcribes RNA from DNA and the error checking mechanisms are so intricate. \\nThe other way can be the kind sort of mentioned by one of the other answerer's. This gene transfer is the so called Horizontal Gene Transfer and it can result in a modified viral strain but I think that is the case mainly for DNA viruses.

I fast and detox once a month and it's great for your mind as well as your body.  If you don't work on a Sunday I think it would be a good day to start.  I start the day with a long bath and throughout the day I try to keep active.  As I'm not a big eater it doesn't bother me if I don't eat food for a week.  For the rest of the week I drink water, fresh juice and herbal teas.  Water helps to break down body fat and get rid of access waste so by the end of the week I have lost about 1/2 stone and feel so much lighter.  If a week seems like a long time to go without anything to eat have raw vegetables.  This is what I have when coming of a detoxing fast.  I also find the hardest thing to eat and drink after is dairy produces.  They seem to have a heavier taste when you haven't had them for a while.  Not only will you loose both weight and toxins from your body you will also feel more happier and alert. \\n\\nDepending on your age, weight and lifestyle if you have any concerns maybe a visit to your doctor would be advisable if you had any real concerns.

I think this is a really excellent question and I'm linking to a law review article on this topic (the link is to a .pdf so be sure you have Acrobat installed before you click).  I do remember that in the Enron case, where Enron's lawyers were filing 200-page pleadings, they actually put a copyright notice on the pleadings!
Married at 25, child at 29(almost 30), and still married after 11 years.  But don't follow my example, make sure you are getting married for the right reasons.  Have a honest conversation together about what you want in life, if you want children or not, and how you'll spend your money in the marriage.  If you don't have these types of conversations early on, you might regret it later.  Best wishes!

The way that I understand the story of Mary and Joseph goes (and it's been awhile since I've read it) is that she was raised in the church basically and had come of age to be married, which if I remember correctly was 15.  Joseph was an older man, with other children, I don't know if he had other wives, but I know he was married at least once before.\\n\\nJoseph didn't want to marry Mary, is the jist of it.  There was some sort of religious thing where all the men stuck their sticks into the ground and one of them would suddenly grow flowers.  Joseph's staff was the one that "won" the maiden, and he was pretty much forced into marrying her.\\n\\nSo anyway, when they married, there was some reason why he couldn't have relations with her, something about how long the ceremony was, like 21 days or something.  He left the city, and didn't return until well AFTER the 21 days was up.  And she was already pregnant.\\n\\nA lot of what I just told you was taken from the Apocrypha, and like I said, it's been a long time since I've even thought about it.

Try checking out your local library for some fitness info.  The web can be something of a challenge.  You might find a fitness magazine you like & see if they have a web-site.\\n\\nYou can safely use about 1-2 pounds a week, but really need to fix the diet issue.  You don't talk about what you drink - so, NO soda, NO sugary drinks.  Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.\\n\\nDitch the Chinese (sauces can be really bad) and use the Pizza as an occassional treat (1-2 pieces only).  Do eat as many veggies & fruits as you can.  Whole grain breads.  Lean meats, like chicken (no skin, not deep fried).\\n\\nRead labels!  Know what's in your food!\\n\\nGood Luck!
Businesses must register with the Secretary of State in your state.  At that time you will have a legally registered company (LLC or Corp, etc).  You can do this yourself, or use an attorney.  In this case you might call the entity ABC Enterprises, LLC.  If you want to conduct business using other names, you must file an assumed name (or D.B.A. doing Business as).  This is sometimes regulated by the state, but usually the county you live in.  Call you county clerks office to check on this.\\n\\nYou could then have several assumed names doing different things, all under the umberall of ABC Enterprises, LLC\\n\\nABC Shipping\\nABC Shopping\\nABC Whatever\\n\\nThis would save you money, as DBA filings are cheap vs LLC filings expensive.

In Game 1 of the 1954 series Mays made one of the greatest defensive plays of all time, a brilliant over-the-shoulder catch of a long drive by Vic Wertz, deep in centre field of the spacious Polo Grounds. The play, now known simply as "The Catch", kept the scores tied. After the Giants' victory, Mays was announced as winner of the National League Most Valuable Player Award and the Hickok Belt as top professional athlete of the year.
Yes, because you are sinning against God by failing to consider Him first in your actions (violating the 1st commandment, "You shall have no other gods before Me."), making a "god" to suit yourself (idolatry, a violation of the 2nd commandment, "You shall not make any idols."), dishonoring you parents name (regardless if they care, the 5th commandment says, "Honor you father and mother.").\\n\\nIf money, sex, or the "fame" of being a stripper is more precious to you than Him, you are denying Him by your lust for sin.\\n\\nIf it was your daughter, would you care if she became a stripper?  (Keep in mind, the drugs, lusting men, the prostitution, and corrupt "businessmen" she'd be interacting with on a daily basis)  Do you really "want" to be a "stripper" with all of its consequences?  Men will disrespect you by lusting for your body, without any concern for you.  "Businessmen" will pretent to "care" for you, but only as a front for using you and your body for their own gain.  You will be exposed to a dark world of exotic drugs, deception, temptatiion, and evil on a regular basis.  Are you ready for all of this?  You are a woman.  Please don't flush all the goodness God has put into you.
That is a relative question.  You could say the US, but then the problem is the widening gap between rich and middle class.  You could say Germany, but the high cost of labor is causing industry to move to Eastern Europe.  You could say Britian, but the govenment funds pubilc enterpirse that directly competes with private enterprise.  You could say China, but there is likely large scale corruption.  You could say Cuba, but the lack of private property means that government could intervene when they feel threatening.  You could also go with Japan, but there is fear in thinking "outside the box."\\n\\nPersonally, I would go with Germany, despite the high labor costs.  Though I don't know much about the Scandinavian countries or Australia.
You need to put together a full blown project plan including a description of the project, how it will be accomplished as well as the costs involved with the project.  Once you have all of that information you can begin shopping the project around.  There are a lot of places that you can go, but you should start with attempting to finance the project yourself before giving away your intellectual property.

I was raped by my x.  He got 8 months in jail while i recieved the rest of my life with the most beautiful girl.  I tried abortion and was unable to finish it.  \\nTake this as a sign from God that there is a reason for this child.  If you are unable to keep it than yes adopt the child out. \\nThe child you carry could very well save the world from cancer, come up with the next treatment for sever retardation in children, or invent the most increadible machine ever. \\n\\nWhat we choose to do makes a differance in the future.  This has happened for a reason.  Go see a doctor, take prenatal vitamans take care of yourself and this baby.  The child living through the abortion pills and inseres makes me believe that this child is wanting to live.  That should have been enough signs but if you are anything like myself I was takingin home preg tests up till 2 weeks before my daughter was born.  I though it would go away.  \\nI laugh at this now 12 years later.  I know you are scared and worrid about what this child may turn out like, but believe me if i  have learned nothing in the last 13 years it is that God has a plan.  I may not know what it is but I do know that when I look at the child i carried i still thank God she lived thought the last 13 years of her life.  \\n\\nI spent the first 9 months trying to figure out how to get rid of this child, and since have spent the last 12 years 3 months trying to figure out how to save her from the tormoils of the world.  \\n\\nTeenage years here we come.  Take this as a blessing and move on.  See a doctor, take care and always believe that the Lord will bring you through what ever you need.\\nI often screamed at God telling him that he has forgoten me, does not realize that i am unable to deal with that which he has given me.  Then i look at my childs eyes and realize.  NOt only did he give me a way to work through the rape, he gave me the most amazing gift any one can have.  A child who loves me for me.  \\n\\nGood luck and feel free to email me.

It depends upon the agency.  Under the 'frequently asked questions' of the CIA for example, a marriage or relationship with a foreign national may affect security processing or eligibility to receive a security clearance.\\n\\n"The agency is required to consider its applicant's relationship with foreign nationals.  The particular concern is if any member of an applicant's family is a citizen of a foreign country.  At the Agency, if the applicant's spouse, intended spouse, or live-in relationship is not a citizen of the US, the Agency will perform security screening of this individual as part of the applicant's security processing.  The foreign national will be asked to sign an authorization for release of information, provide biographic data for a a background investigation, and undergo a polygraph examination.  Furthermore, a condition of employment for Agency employees is that their foreign national spouses et al, must agree to become a naturalized US citizen as soon as eligible under standard immigration procedures.  The Agency will render a decision to hire an applicant only after both the applicant and the foreign national favorably complete security processing."
What is White gold?\\n\\nWhite gold is an alloy of gold and some white metals such as silver and palladium. White gold can be 18ct, 14ct, 10ct or any karat. For example, 18ct yellow gold is made by mixing 75% gold (750 parts per thousand) with 25% (250 parts per thousand) other metals such as copper and zinc. 18ct white gold is made by mixing 75% gold with 25% other metals such as silver and palladium. So the amount of gold is the same but the alloy is different.\\n\\nTraditionally nickel was used in white gold, however, nickel is no longer used in most white gold made today as nickel can cause reactions with some people. We generally do not use or sell nickel in our white gold.\\n\\nWhen white gold rings are new they are coated with another white metal called Rhodium. Rhodium is a metal very similar to platinum and Rhodium shares many of the properties of platinum including its white color.\\n\\nThe rhodium plating is used to make the white gold look more white. The natural color of white gold is actually a light grey color. The Rhodium is very white and very hard, but it does wear away eventually. To keep a white gold ring looking its best it should be re-rhodium plated approximately each 12 to 18 months. \\n\\n \\n\\nWhy am I allergic to some gold jewelry? \\n\\nEvery year we get a few customers who believe that they cannot wear gold jewelry because they get an allergic reaction to it. Some believe that they are allergic to gold. We have never yet known anybody who was allergic to pure gold, and seems very unlikely as gold is inert and not active in the sense of corrosion or decomposition over time, nor is it acidic.\\nThe most common cause of allergic reactions to jewelry is nickel contained in the alloy. Nickel is, or was, frequently used in white gold alloys because it is inexpensive, hard, and has a strong whitening effect. Better quality white gold alloys use palladium, which has excellent properties but is more expensive. \\n\\nCommonest Causes\\nThe next commonest cause of allergies for jewelry wearers appears to be detergent or other chemicals which lodge between the jewelry, usually rings, and the skin. Hairdressers are often affected. Rinsing well can help, but it is probably best to remove rings before using any troublesome chemicals, and use a barrier cream. \\n\\nOther Causes\\nA few jewelry wearers still seem to be slightly allergic to yellow gold's, nickel cannot be the cause because it is not used in yellow gold alloys. In most cases sufferers only experience problems with low gold content alloys such as ten carat, so upgrading to a better alloy such as eighteen carat usually solves all problems. \\n\\nHigher Carat Gold\\nThe other common components of ten carat gold alloys are copper, silver and zinc. Zinc is usually very well tolerated, it is used in many medical preparations. Silver and copper do not usually cause allergic reactions, but both will form compounds with atmospheric pollutants which may be the cause of some reported problems. When copper and silver are present in high carat alloy such as eighteen or twenty two carat, they are more resistant to attack by chemicals, because they are bound more closely with the gold content, and this will explain why high carat alloys cause fewer problems. \\n\\nAnti-Perspirants\\nStrange as it may seem, but using anti-Perspirants can exacerbate metal allergy problems. It has been found that the sweat of a healthy person in a sauna can contain 20 times the nickel content of blood plasma, this may help to explain why exercise can improve health. Anti-Perspirants can reduce the bodies natural way of eliminating heavy metals. Healthy natural lifestyles tend to improve health, whereas unnatural practices can cause problems.
Mark 9:1, "And he said to them, "Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see that the kingdom of God has come with power."\\n\\nJesus meant himself... his death and resurrection... the coming of the Holy Spirit.  That is what I gather together.  Jesus repeatedly said, "The kingdom of God is near".\\n\\nIndeed they did not taste death --- the Spirit of Jesus came... with power.\\n\\nAddition:\\nThis does not refer to the actual "second coming" but the coming of the Spirit of God.

It is the social perception - based on thousands of years of observation - that women are able to act in entirely non-sexual behaviors while men do not. A man wearing women's clothing is perceived as being frustrated sexually, so frustrated that he is attempting to be attractive to other men in the hope/expectation of sex. However, women are not perceived as sex pursuers, and so are free to wear men's clothing - or any clothing they want. It is a double standard, but like most double standards with women and men, we can be thankful for it.

Checkmate (frequently shortened to mate) is a situation in chess (and in other boardgames of the chaturanga family) in which one player's king is under attack and there is no way to meet that threat; it is a check from which there is no escape. The king is never actually captured—the game ends as soon as the king is checkmated. A player who is checkmated loses the game. Delivering checkmate is the ultimate goal in chess (although not all games end in checkmate often a player resigns before checkmate is administered, or the game may end in a draw in several ways).

Getting and keeping children in school is a complex family and community commitment.\\n\\nFactor that affect this commitment are the parents level of education, family's dependence on government assistance, fathers amount, type and attitude to work, mothers attitude to work and influence of father on mother. Whether alcohol consummation is a factor. Finally is the attitude of the family to government school.\\n\\nLike all children, their level of commitment is a product of the influence as a role model provided by each parent and the direct/indirect influence the parent has on the sibling.\\n\\nThen you look at the average country school and you see other factors that could affect attendance. The teaching staff needs to be looked at. Do they want to be in a country school and what factors influenced the decision to be in a country school.Even subtle factors as the teachers attitude to reconciliation could influence indigenous attendance. \\n\\nThen in the classroom is the ratio of white to indigenous students, what effect the peer group(s) of white students is/are, what the effect the peer group(s) of indigenous student is is/are, amount and type of bullying and that could be present in the school.\\n\\nThen there is the peer group the child could be associating with out of school. Is petrol sniffing or other anti=social activities going on in the group and school achievement by other members of the peer group.\\n\\nWhat I've described is broad and coarse look at factors that influence the child and there are bound to some I've missed. Each factor should be looked at and an analysis of negative and positive aspects need to be drawn up then how we all can overcome the negative ones.\\n\\nWish you luck on the assignment

I find your options too limited.  Its never been about facts, its about hope love and charity.  We all have a good idea what those virtues are, but there is not a fact among them.\\nDoes a parent love their child?  You can't do experiments on that to decide, black or white, its true or false.  As the Savage Garden song goes, "I believe parents did the best they knew how to do".\\nDo you know if an elevator is safe, for a fact, before you go into it.  No, if you had to prove everything before you believed it - assumed it - you would be frozen with uncertainty.\\nThe best you can hope for is reasonable certainty.\\nReligion is reasonable, though many religious people are totally unreasonable in they way they talk about religion.\\n\\nI guess you think science is all about facts, but most of it is theory, reasonable assumptions.  Data have to be reasonably accurate but even with the best intentions, the next experiment could show a weakness in a theory.  That why they do the experiment.\\n\\nSo lets open our minds with a good degree of humility and be reasonable in the way we treat each other, we are all in this together.

One is eligible to take the bar exam with only law-office study in California, Maine, New York, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming. In addition, you are eligible in California, DC, and New Mexico to take the test if you only have correspondence study. Each state is very different on these requirements, particularly on how long you must work at a law firm, and some of those do require some classroom experience at an ABA accredited law school, even though they don't require a JD or LLD.\\n\\nThat being said, it is pretty rare for someone to apply for and be accepted to the bar without a law degree. It is simply the easiest, fastest way to learn all of the information necessary for the bar exam.
go get one then.

There are 3 cases where I feel getting an abortion would be ok. Rape, as the pregnancy is due to an act of violence, severe deformity of the fetus, (not down syndrome or FAS, I mean deformities where it would be unlikely for the child to live for more than a few days after birth), and where giving birth would kill the mother. Abortion is not birth control, though.\\n\\nThe problem I have with the Pro-Life movement is that, to them, there are no exceptions. They base there stand on strictly religious views and not on the concept of "greater good". Is the life of a living, breathing person any less important than that of one who hasn't been born yet? Is it right to bring a child into this world if they will, without a doubt, be dead in a matter of hours? Where's the compassion in that? I know a couple who went through that a few years ago and would not wish it on anyone.

Carbon and Life\\n\\n    It is hard to overstate the importance of carbon; its unique capacity for forming multiple bonds and chains at low energies makes life as we know it possible, and justifies an entire major branch of chemistry - organic chemistry - dedicated to its compounds. In fact, most of the compounds known to science are carbon compounds, often called organic compounds because it was in the context of biochemistry that they were first studied in depth.\\n\\n    What makes carbon so special is that every carbon atom is eager to bond with as many as four other atoms. This makes it possible for long chains and rings to be formed out of them, together with other atoms - almost always hydrogen, often oxygen, sometimes nitrogen, sulfur or halides. The study of these is the basis of organic chemistry; the compounds carbon forms with metals are generally considered inorganic. Chains and rings are fundamental to the way carbon-based life forms - that is, all known life-forms - build themselves. Silicon is capable of forming the same sorts of bonds and structures, but opinion is divided on whether silicon-based life forms are a realistic prospect - in part because it needs higher energies to form them, and in part because whereas carbon dioxide (one of the main by-products of respiration, a process essential to all known life) is a gas and therefore easy to remove from the body, its counterpart silicon dioxide (silica) has an inconveniently high melting point, posing a serious waste disposal problem for any would-be silicon-based life form.\\n\\nFuel\\n\\n    Almost everything we use as fuel, whether in food or power stations, is also based on one kind of carbon-based chain or another; everything from natural gas through petrol and alcohol to oil to wax and plastic is composed of hydrocarbon chains of various lengths. As a general rule, the longer the chains and the more saturated they are (meaning every atom of carbon bonds to four other atoms), the less volatile and more viscous the substance will be, and the higher its evaporation temparature. This spread of evaporation temperatures makes it possible to separate the wide range of different hydrocarbons present in crude oil through a process known as fractional distillation, heating the oil to a range of temperatures in sequence and collecting the vapors released. The other big class of carbon-based fuel (used universally by plants and animals, but rarely by power stations) is the carbohydrate family - sugar molecules and the things you can make from them, like starch, cellulose and so on.\\n\\nElemental Carbon\\n\\n    Besides its millions of compounds, carbon also bonds with itself in different ways to form graphite, diamond, fullerenes and amorphous solids. Under certain conditions, it can also form white carbon - a transparent, biregringent material about which little else seems to be known.\\n\\n    In graphite, probably best known for its use in pencil 'lead' (for which purpose it is mixed with clay), the carbon is loosely bonded in crystalline layers which are able to slip over one another, so it is relatively soft and deposits itself readily on flat surfaces when drawn over them. It is used as a lubricant, in clay, and as an electrical conductor - one of the few solid, non-metallic conductors. Diamond, by contrast, is the hardest substance known to man; it has a dense, extremely stable crystalline structure, and conducts heat extraordinarily well but electricity hardly at all. Thanks to its hardness it has many industrial applications, while its high refractive index gives jewellery a sparkle which is hard to match.\\n\\n    Another form of elemental carbon, the fullerene, was not observed until 1985, although the possibility of its existence had been suggested as long ago as 1966. The most basic fullerene, (C60, the buckyball - short for buckminsterfullerene) has the form of a football - that's a soccer ball if you American, or a truncated icosahedron if you're a

MLM is legal because there is actually a product involved.  It's basically where you buy something from a distributor and then distribute it to someone else who distributes it again, and so on.  Eventually someone buys and consumes the products.  It's similar to all normal commerce, but the reason nobody makes any money is that after a few levels, there are so many middlemen marking it up that there is no more room to price it much higher and actually sell it.  That's why they tell you to sell to friends and family, because they are more sympathetic and are willing to pay more to be nice.\\n\\nPonzi as I understand it just involves sending money to people, and then getting other people to send money to you AND the people above you for a few levels, and then those people get even more people to send money to them and you, etc.  There is no actual commerce involved, and it is mathematically guaranteed to fail after some number of levels.\\n\\n"Pyramid scheme" is usually used synonymously with the Ponzi scheme, and they are all illegal except for the Federal Reserve and Social Security systems.

have U tried thier official web site?U should try it,& GOOD LUCK>\\nwww.middlesbroughfc.com
Since you alreay know how to use a computer, I'm very surprised you haven't used a search engine like Google or Yahoo to locate the Official Rules of Tennis online, and answer this question yourself.\\n\\nIf you have further questions about tennis rules, you should find it helpful to visit the USTA's (United States Tennis Association) website.\\n\\nHERE IS THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION - - - -\\n\\nThe Official Rules of Tennis give the following 3 options to the coin toss (or racquet spin):\\n\\n1. Choice of Serving or Receiving -\\n\\nIt's considered an advantage to serve first because a speedy ball is difficult for an opponent to return.\\n\\nIf you have a consistent and fast and/or tricky serve, which makes you more likely to win the opening game of the match, then definitely serve first because you gain the psychological advantage of holding serve.\\n\\nIf you have a weak serve, and are more likely to lose the opening game of the match, which is a definite psychological disadvantage, then definitely receive first.\\n\\n2. Choice of Side -\\n\\nOften, the choice of side makes no difference. In fact, if you're playing tennis indoors, there's generally no difference at all because there are no climatic conditions to affect your match.\\n\\nHowever, it is possible, although quite atypical, that there are other factors to influence your decision. This could include having something in the background behind the baseline that makes it difficult to see the ball well.\\n\\nMost of the time, a meaningful difference occurs when you're playing tennis outdoors and unfavorable weather conditions warrant making a choice.\\n\\nOne unfavorable condition is having the sun low in the sky and shining in your eyes, making it difficult for you to see. In this case, it's best to choose the side not facing the sun, even if it means relinquishing your serve to your opponent. After all, you wouldn't want to lose the psychological advantage of winning the opening game.\\n\\nAnother unfavorable condition occurs when the wind is blowing so strongly that it makes it difficult to keep the ball in. Unfortunately, there are many differing opinions on what to do in this case.\\n\\nIn my opinion, if you're good at generating topspin, I'd say it would be best to have the wind at your back, thereby giving you extra speed on both your serve and groundstrokes.\\n\\n3. Choice given to Opponent -\\n\\nMost tennis players don't actually know the Official Rules of Tennis and, therefore, aren't aware of this choice.\\n\\nI'm a decisive person, so I always prefer to make a choice when it's warranted. If making a choice isn't truly warranted, then don't worry... it doesn't matter anyway!\\n\\nSPECIAL NOTE #1: Please don't make the mistake of combining Choices 1 and 2. The two choices are kept completely separate because it would be completely unfair to choose to serve with the wind behind you.\\n\\nSPECIAL NOTE #2: Don't worry about making a mistake when it comes to making a choice. After all, tennis players change sides every other game which tends to even things out. In fact, it's only the opening game that's affected by the choices. Still, in the case of a hotly contested match between players of more or less equal skills, this could make a difference.\\n\\nSPECIAL NOTE #3: It's a very sad fact that the vast majority of tennis players haven't read the Official Rules of Tennis and, therefore, make mistakes about the rules more often than not.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor... Read the rules!
She should wait until she's at least 18 to make such a life changing decision.  They really could be in love, I believe that.  But she needs to think of her future before tying herself down at such a young age.  And if he really loves her, he'll give her the freedom to do that.

I myself am a agriculture major with a Master's degree. I have a few friends who are in the field of Botany and Plant Pathology (it studies the diseases plants can get) Here are some materials for your thinking.\\n\\nIf you think you like to do research, going to grad school at least for Master's degree is necessary. As a Botany major, you can work as a researcher/research assistant. Schools like UC Davis, UC Riverside, Cornell, Purdue, Texas A&M,etc, have great research labs to work at. You can also work for USDA (Department of Agriculture). They have many many experimental stations in almost every state. At such environment you have more chance to work with local farmers or agro industry while doing research. Some people like this better than pure research in universities.\\nBesides, you can also work as a plant breeder for private seed companies. Teaching at college level is also an option after you finish the grad school.(Be sure to work as a teaching asistance before you graduate. This gives you good experience-you get to teach while experienced professors are suprovising by your side)\\n\\nSince you have not decided your major, I would suggest you to work in a research lab in Botany or Horticulture, just to know what life is like working in this field. You'll know if it's for you soon after you work there. Good luck and have fun!

Here is your detailed synopsis:\\n\\nKyle Pratt is a frantic but fiercely intelligent mother whose deepest protective instincts will be triggered by a haunting in-flight nightmare: in the middle of the trans-Atlantic trip, her young daughter turns up missing without a trace. Or does she? Kyle arrives on the flight still reeling from the recent loss of her husband, a woman who has gone mad with grief or a formidably determined mother whose child is in grave danger that threatens the entire plane? Adding to the growing mystery is the fact that the name of Kyle's daughter doesn't even appear on the flight manifest. Furthermore, neither of the flight attendants can remember seeing the child on the plane? Adding to the growing mystery is the fact that the name of Kyle's daughter doesn't even appear on the flight manifest. Furthermore, neither of the flight attendants can remember seeing the child on the plane. While Captain Rich and Air Marshal Gene Carson don't want to doubt Kyle's insistent claim that her daughter has vanished, all evidence points to the fact that Kyle's little girl was never on board. What is the truth behind Kyle Pratt's distress? Who on board can be trusted? And just how far will Kyle have to go to get to the bottom of the harrowing mystery? As paranoia and doubt mount among the passengers, Kyle is confronted with some of the most unsettling fears a mother could ever face--losing her child, having her very reality questioned and being trapped in a situation where no one can seem to help. Pushed to the edge and fighting for her sanity, Kyle finds herself willing to go to unimaginable lengths to save her daughter.\\n\\nStarring:   Jodie Foster, Peter Sarsgaard, Sean Bean, Kate Beahan, Michael Irby
Probably because neither team supporters want to loose. They can't blame their own team for not playing well so the referee cops it. No doubt that mistakes can be made by a ref but it goes both ways. They should look at their own players who didn't play well.
Assume the forearm is pointed straight forward, so the force is directed along its long axis. Calculate the force on the arm from F=ma, with m 3.0kg, and a the acceleration 80kph/.0047sec (fix the units so it's all m/sec first). Then you have the force, and you have the cross-sectional area that's bearing that load, so F/A=P to get the pressure or stress. Maybe divide by two if there's two bones.

All I can do is give you my gut feeling. It may ring true with you, it may not. \\n\\nIt seems to me you have a fear of taking a risk, or making a commitment to something. This could be a general fear or something specific in your life at present. You are concerned about the downside, of what could go wrong. It's a big fear, as almost killing a small child would be a terrible consequence. \\n\\nHaving to make a choice is consistent with this theme. You cannot sit on the fence forever. Sooner or later you have to take a risk or make a commitment. Otherwise you go nowhere. Maybe even go backwards. \\n\\nI'm not sure of the significance of the girl disappearing and reappearing. Possibly it represents her transformation from a victim to your conscience. Anyway, it's you talking. The ghost is you telling yourself you have to make a choice. \\n\\nThe girl as victim might also be you as well. Are you the one who stands to get hurt the most? Could you lose something of your inner child? Anyway the girl is strong. She has determination. But she also wants to suffer out of sight. Sounds like she doesn't want to ask for help.  \\n\\nIt's very significant for you. Whatever it is, it's screaming at you! \\n\\nIf my interpretation rings true with you, you need to take more risks to get what you want, or commit to a specific course of action in something that is troubling you at present. And maybe you have to ask others for help. \\n\\nIf you take the action and the dream goes away, you have solved the problem. If not, you have to keep trying with other possible interpretations.

Si(100) is the way crystallographers have chosen to describe the crystal plane that is on the surface.  In a crystal, the positions of the atoms form a regular lattice structure, and the smallest unit of that structure that repeats itself is called a unit cell.  Si(100) tells you that the surface of the wafer is a plane that crosses the x-axis on the surface of a unit cell, and is parallel to the yz-plane.  This information can be used to determine the spacing between atoms on the surface, and their arrangement i.e. square, hexagonal, etc.  From the spacing and configuration, you can determine what materials will form a good interface with that surface-- things with a lattice mismatch of a few percent usually work well.

I was shy as hell... what helped me get over it is just throwing myself into a situtation where I was forced to confront my fears. For example. I took a speech class in high school where about once a week we had do give a speech in front of the class. Also I volunteered at a nursing home... that doesn't force you to talk infront of a large group but it makes you talk to people from all walks of life. It makes you get used to talking to different people and strangers. Plus with my job that I have now (receptionist) I have to talk to A LOT of people and have to at least act like a people person. I say just throw yourself in their and all will get easier after a few times.\\nPractice makes perfect.
The first interpretation has this celebration originating as a pagan tradition in the third century. During this time hordes of hungry wolves roamed outside of Rome where shepherds kept their flocks. The God Lupercus, was said to watch over the shepherds and their flocks and keep them from the wolves. Every February the Romans celebrated a feast called Lupercalia to honor Lupercus so that no harm would come to the shepherds and their flocks. Also during Lupercalia, but in honor of the goddess Juno Februata, the names of young women were put into a box and names were drawn by lot. The boys and girls who were matched would be considered partners for the year, which began in March. This celebration continued long after wolves were a problem to Rome.\\n\\nAs Christianity became prevalent, priests attempted to replace old heathen practices. To Christianize the ancient pagan celebration of the Feast of Lubercus, the church officials changed the name to St. Valentine's Day. To give the celebration further meaning and eliminate pagan traditions, priests substituted the drawing of Saints names for the names of the girls. On St. Valentine's Day the priest placed saint's names into an urn or box. The young people then drew a name from the container. In the following year, the youth was supposed to emulate the life of the saint whose name he had drawn. \\n\\nBy the fourteenth century they reverted back to the use of girl's names. In the sixteenth century they once again tried to have saintly valentines but it was as unsuccessful as the first attempt.\\n\\nWhile it can't be proved historically, there were seven men named Valentine who were honored with feasts on February 14th. Of these men, two stories link incidents that could have given our present day meaning to St. Valentine's Day.\\n\\nOne of these men named Valentine was a priest during the reign of Emperor Claudius. Valentine was revered by the young and old, rich and poor, with people of all walks of life attending his services. At this time Emperor Claudius was heavily recruiting men to serve as soldiers for his wars without much success. The men preferred not to leave their wives, families and sweethearts to fight in foreign lands. Claudius became angry and declared that no more marriages could be performed and all engagements were cancelled.\\n\\nValentine thought this to be unfair and secretly married several couples. When Claudius found out, he threw Valentine in prison where he died. Friends of the priest retrieved his body and buried it in a churchyard in Rome.\\n\\nAnother version had St. Valentine jailed for helping Christians. While Valentine was in prison he cured a jailer's daughter of blindness. Claudius became enraged and had Valentine clubbed and beheaded on February 14, 269 A.D. \\n\\nYet another story claims that Valentine fell in love with the jailer's daughter and wrote her letters that were signed "From your Valentine."\\n\\nAll of the seven Valentines eventually evolved into one. In 496 Pope Gelasius declared the day in honor of St. Valentine. Through the centuries the Christian holiday became a time to exchange love messages and St. Valentine became the patron saint of lovers. Lovers' quarrels come under his jurisdiction and, naturally, he is the patron saint of engaged couples and of anyone wishing to marry. \\n\\n:-)
A great source of protein is hard boiled eggs, but just eat the white. Give the yolk to your dog or cat. That way you avoid the fat and cholesterol. Or make scrambled eggs and before cooking separate out the yolk and just use mostly whites, with maybe just one yolk. Lean fish and chicken are great, too, and if you can afford it, buy organic and all-natural meat. You still need to balance it out with fresh green and yellow vegetables, fresh fruit, whole grains (like oatmeal, whole-grain bread, brown rice, etc) for a balanced diet.

Homes in Arizona (Tucson and Phoenix specifically) are sitting on the market longer these days.  Many forclosures will be coming on the market as people's adjustable rate mortgages keep rising and they can't make their monthly payments. I would say wait a year to get a good deal, but the drawback to that is that rates will be higher then. You'll have to do the math to see which is a better decision.

Just give the girl some time. That could mean a month or a year. But if she was engaged to this guy than she had to have some real serious feelings for him. If you really like this girl than stay by her and be the friend that she needs you to be right now. Even if you want more just give her the space that she is asking for.  You 2 may slip up every now and then and do something here and there but until she is ready to come out and say that she is ready to take that next step again than it will never work.  Just remember that you can only wait as long as your hart will let you. She is not the only one making the decision. You both have to make that choice and not have had anything to drink. Don't push it unless you want it to fail.

Yes, acctually the states that we know as California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah were all once a part of what was known as Northern Mexico.  However, due to a treaty signed on February 2, 1848, known as, The Treaty of Guadeloupe Hidalgo, the U.S. annexed the Northern half of Mexico to a tune of 15 million dollars.  This all came at the conclusion of the Mexican - American War, which started due to the Westward expansion of Americans and the Texas war for Independence.

If you need info for research a good place to look is a law library.  A state univ. that has a law school will have an up-to-date law library.  Also Little Rock will have a state law library.  There are attendants who can help you search, but if no one is available some sets of books are alphabetical others by state code.  There is an index for both sets.  Just takes a little time to get on to the system.  Also if you are reading the law books keep a law reference dictionary handy.\\n\\nIf you need to know this info because you are in some sort of trouble, contact an attorney asap.

if you are talking about runway models --- no... kate moss is an exception at 5'7" tall.  Designers make haute coutour clothes for tall women -- they fall better on tall lanky figures.  However - there are MANY other types of models other than just runway fashion models...  and I am pretty sure if you are not modeling on a runway, you don't have to be extraordinarily tall.

u hav 0 to 9 single digit numbers.\\nu were asked to construct a 4 digits number from those numbers.\\n\\nthe first digit can be either 1-9 but not zero, so u hav 9 numbers to choose.\\n\\nnow that u hav chosen a number let say 1\\n\\nso next, u have to choose another number to be the second digit. because u were asked for no repetation, your only choice is number 2-9 and 0 so u hav another 9 numbers to choose from. so let say u choose number 2. so we hav now 12**, two more digits to fill in.\\n\\nnext,\\nagain the rule no repetation, so for the third digit u can choose any number between 3-9 and 0. u have now 8 numbers to choose from. let say u choose number 3. so u have 123*\\n\\nnext for the last digit, u have to choose number 4-9 and 0. u have 7 choices of numbers here.\\n\\nso there we go\\n\\n9 X 9 X 8 X 7 = 4536 possible 4 digits numbers^^

One way that accelerator experiments demonstrate this is by the fact that as the electron speed reaches closer to the speed of light the bending magnets need to have their current increased in order to deflect the increasingly massive electrons.

Canseco, and  Ken Caminiti both admited using steroids. Canseco's book and Caminiti's admission was what broke open the steroids scandal in baseballe. \\n\\nBonds and Sosa may still face perjury charges over denial of steroid usage. Bonds later ADMITTED using steroids. He claimed he did not know the cream contained steroids. McGwire used steroids before they were banned in baseball and has admitted to their use. \\n\\nPalmiero was caught in a steroid test by MLB. \\n\\nGrimsley has confirmed Bond's steroid use as well as admitting he and many others used steroids.  So for those of you who still don't believe Bonds used steroids you have Bonds own admission, you have testimony from several players and you have the indictment of his trainer for giving the steroids to Bonds and other athletes like Giambi and Sheffield.  What more do you need.  A big blinking sign over his head saying "I used steroids".  \\n\\nBonds is also the perfect model for steroid use. He was always a pretty decent power hitter. Normally around 35 HRs a year. On a good year he got close to 40. One season he hit more than 40. Then at an age when most players retire and he was looking very washed up. All of his stats had been in decline, there was even talk about whether he'd retire. What happens next is Bonds suddenly has his best year of his career. Hits more HRs than he'd ever hit in a single season. The next year pretty much doubles his previous best season. He was 36 or 37 when he did this. \\n\\nSosa again shows the same kind of pattern. Sosa was not scheduled to start in his break out year. Also the year he's reputed to have started using steroids. Sosa had been dumped on the Cubs, his third team and the Cubs were out of patience with him as well. Sosa came very close to being released in the off season. Then all of a sudden he started hitting with power out of nowhere. Sosa credited his hitting instructor. Everybody laughed and figured he was a fluke. He was too old to be a real prospect by then. Instead Sosa went on to win HR crowns and his famous battle with fellow steroid user McGwire for the single season HR record. \\n\\nGary Sheffield and Jason Giambi were both implicated by testimony and with reasonable certainty can be called steroid users. I think Giambi has even since admitted using them. \\n\\nOther big names have had rumors circulated about them. Pettite and Clemens were two but both of those rumors were refuted. Pitchers gain little from steroid use and risk much. So few pitchers use them. Curt Schilling and Kenny Rogers are two other pitchers who's names have surfaced in rumors. There has been nothing to back these rumors however.  \\n\\nI personally suspect Schilling did try steroids. He matches the pattern for pitchers. Most pitchers caught using steroids have been pitchers on the edge. Guys who are in serious danger of no longer staying in Baseball. Schilling was blasted in his first couple years in the rotation and was shifted to the bullpen with less than spectacular results. Until he became a closer he was in real danger of being sent back to the minors. Then he got another shot at the rotation and a few years later learned how to pitch effectively.  Schilling had all the trademarks. Bullpen pitcher, bounced from team to team, in danger of being pushed out of baseball and getting up in the years to where he was no longer considered a real prospect. \\n\\nOther big names with credible evidence against them include Fred McGriff and Frank Thomas. \\n\\nLuis Gonzales is another name that's been rumored as a steroid user. Nothing hard in evidence has ever surfaced against him. He was a long time teamate of Caminitti and like Caminitti suddenly had break out offensive years in their early 30s. \\n\\nThe classical Steroid user changes are illustrated in Derek Lee's sudden fame. Gary Mathews is another. Both after being given up on by multiple teams, on the edge of being bounced out of Baseball suddenly have all

Sorry to disappoint you mate- but it's impossible! Girls are the most unpredictable of all God's creations (trust me- I'm a girl). But, if you really want to know a girl inside out, then the best way is to become her best friend. This works especially if you're a boy, because girls tend to tell boys things they might not always tell other girls. So, listen to her, and talk to her, and get to know her, and you'll start to get a rough idea of what's on her mind. Also, pay attention to her body language, and expressions. It works sometimes! But be warned, no two girls are alike, and sometimes, even the girl doesn't really know how she feels, and when she does, she probably won't tell you... It's an art that takes time and practice... You could just ask her what's on her mind, I suppose!

Walk the dog is a trick where you are basically using the tennis ball like a basketball bouncing it between your legs as you walk.  Spinning the racket on your finger is self explanitory.  Catching a ball in mid flight without a bounce requires you to catch and cradle the ball as you turn the racket over while decelerating the ball in harmony with the take back of your racket.  Throwing your racket in the air spinning fast and catching the handle a la Hicham Arazi the magician, is the best I have ever seen at this.  Also there is spinning the racket around your neck and onto your other hand, which is very difficult and I have only known a couple of players that could do it.  There is some other tricks to, but explaining the racket motion requires a lot of typing and is not easily explained without having seen it done in person.

Friendship is a human relationship which involves mutual knowledge, esteem, and affection. Friends will welcome each other's company and exhibit loyalty towards each other, often to the point of putting the other's interests before one's own. Their tastes will be similar and may converge, and they will share enjoyable activities. They will also engage in mutually helping behavior, such as exchange of advice and the sharing of hardship. A friend is someone who may often demonstrate reciprocating and reflective behaviors. Yet for many, friendship is nothing more than the trust that someone or something will not harm them.
Relevance theory is a proposal (by Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson) that seeks to explain the second method of communication: implicit inferences. It argues that the human mind will instinctively react to an encoded message by considering information that it conceives to be relevant to the message. By "relevance" it is meant whatever allows the most new information to be transmitted in that context on the basis of the least amount of effort required to convey it.

My daughter has a degree in psychology.  She works as a behavioral therapist with youth and adults with autism.  Your best options will probably be in similar types of jobs - counseling and behavior therapy, especially if you don't have a masters degree.  \\n\\nIf you have only an undergraduate degree my advice would be to work for a couple of years to get good experience, and then go back to school and get a masters as more opportunities.  You might also consider volunteering for a crisis center or shelter - you may even be able to get a job there in some aspect of therapy, support, or counseling.  You can't work as a psychologist with just an undergraduate degree, but I expect you know that. \\n\\nMany large companies are interested in individuals with psychology degrees as they are realizing that the more technical degrees don't necessarily always prepare individuals well for the real life of work, so check out job postings in areas you might like to live.  You never know what may turn up.\\n\\nWhat I always advised my children was if they saw a job advertised which they were interested in and thought they could do, apply, even if they didn't have the exact qualifications.  If you can present yourself well, and are a quick learner, interviewers pick up on that - they are always looking for people with potential.  \\n\\nBest of luck with your job search.

First, I won't go into the legality of downloading movies. There are copyright laws in the US that would make downloading movies a crime.

Who is this guy?  The owner of the building?  The property manager?  The super?  A  current tenant who is subletting?\\n\\nWhere is this studio?  In NYC?  Did you go by the property?  If so, was it vacant?\\n\\nWhat you do depends on answers to those questions.  The police aren't going to help you just because someone isn't answering their phone.  You need to find out what this persons authority is as far as renting out the studio, and proceed from there.\\n\\n"And if you signed a rental agreement, then you have the right to move in. Go pick the lock and move in :)"    Don't ever do this.  There are people out there who rent apartments that are not theirs to rent, and being scammed won't stop you from being arrested, especially in NYC.  You will be in jail for 3 days before you get a chance to tell your side of the story and even then they may not let you out.
Why does this kind of nonsense puzzle people?\\n\\nLook, the whole Jesus story reads a little too much like old Greek legends.  Hercules was half human, half god.  No big deal.\\n\\nThe fact that Jesus was god, or semi-god, but still could be killed by a bunch of Jews/Romans...what kind of god is that?  Or that people make a fuss if Jesus did something actually human like had sex or fathered children...why?  I would not worship some god that appeared to be human and ended up getting killed as a virgin in his mid 30s.  \\n\\nThe inane "Da Vinci Code" crowd, of course thinks Jesus's children were the Merovingians, some Frankish (French) kings with long hair.  Whop de de.  I imagine if Jesus had children, they would like middle eastern kids--like Israelis or Palestinian kids.  But would they have their daddy's "magic"?  Leave me alone.  It doesn't matter.  Look outside.  This world is a mess.  If Jesus had kids, they didn't do a very good job against the forces of evil.

http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9143/index1.html\\n\\nUnderstand that all the oil companies in this country are foaming at the lips to develop shale oil.  Even conservative estimates put the amount we have at 100% of our need for hundreds of years.  Shale oil is NOT a poor source of oil.  Indeed, we get about 20% of our oil from canadian shale oil, and they have FAR less than we do.  Our shale oil reserves are FAR greater than all the oil in the middle east combined.  It would take less than a year to convert to 100% shale oil and cost far less for that oil than we are currently paying, even considering in the development costs of the first year (after that, it's far cheaper to maintain it).\\n\\nThe only thing standing in the way is Congress.\\n\\nAlso, understand this.  We do not have to convert over to 100% domestic supply (although it would be a good idea to have the capability to rapidly do so by vastly increasing our refinery capabilities).  All we would need to do is maybe supply an extra 25% of our own needs.  That would crash the oil market and break the back of the terrorist funding middle east.  The ability to slide our oil import consumption up and down would give us an incredibly potent weapon to use against these jackasses and force them to behave.
Hi Red Rock\\n\\nHere are some ideas on how to heal the issue.\\n\\nCauses\\nWarts are caused by any of 35 viruses and are often a consequence of poor diet and nutrition, poor hygiene, and, in the cases of genital warts, unprotected sex. Warts also become more common as a consequence of aging with corresponding diminished immune function.\\n\\nCaution: Some warts can turn into cancerous tumors. If they do not seem benign, consult with a physician immediately.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------...\\n\\nNatural Cures\\n\\nNote: Natural healing of warts may require one to two months of care, with the wart disappearing suddenly in one to three days.\\n\\nAromatherapy: Lemon essential oil applied topically can speed healing. Thuja oil is also effective for dealing with warts.\\n\\nDiet: Eat an organic, whole foods diet, emphasizing foods that are high in vitamin A, such as dark green and yellow vegetables, cold-water fish, eggs, and sulfur, such as onions, garlic, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and broccoli. Avoid all refined and processed foods, sugar, unhealthy fats, and excess animal proteins, as well as milk and dairy products.\\n\\nHerbs: a.Onions for Warts: Warts have been said to disappear when treated perseveringly with raw onion dipped in salt. \\n\\nb.Wild Lettuce for Warts: The expressed juice is "much regarded as an application to boils, abscesses and carbuncles, and if put upon warts will cause them to drop off. \\n\\nc.Garlic for Warts and Moles: Here is a very successful routine for removal of these unwanted growths called moles, or warts. Take a button of garlic, slice or cut in two, and placed the cup area over a wart of mole. Tape it on, and as it dries out put a fresh piece. Many users have reported good results. \\n\\nd.Cashew Oil: The cashew oil, which must be used with great caution, is used as an application to warts, corns, ringworms, cancerous ulcers. \\n\\nd.Potassium Deficiency for Warts and Moles: When cysts or tumors grow in places where they can be seen outside the body, often we react by having them cut out. This defeats healing by working on the effect instead of the cause. You can cut cysts out, tumors off, and burn warts off (which are also a potassium deficiency), or get rid of as many moles as you wish, but unless you go to the cause, they will grow back again, and you may end up with as many or more cysts, tumors, moles as before. Different signs of potassium deficiency will keep popping out on the body because the condition that needs correcting is on the inside. You have to go into the cause, Dr. Christopher always insisted, which is the way we have been eating.Potassium sources: There are several ways to receive your potassium. Dr. Bernard Jensen sells a potassium broth made from dehydrated vegetables. Dr. Bronner makes a similar, excellent product. You can also make your own potassium broth by simmering equal parts of red potatoes, celery, carrots, onions, and herbs to taste.

Not only was I tempted to, but I fell into it. And hopefully you can learn from my passed sin  . IT'S NOT WORTH  IT !!!!   When we get tempted,we are blinded to all the consequences that follow. And believe me, there will be consequences .. but here is the good news.. Being tempted is not a sin .. resist the devil and he will flee from you . trust me, you will be greatly disappointed in the end,with unbelievable heartache . \\nIt is the Christians duty to cast  down those imaginations that exault themselves above God and bring them into the obedience and captivity of Jesus .. Shut the thoughts down, and replace them with God's word .. Lord Bless you ....\\n\\nemotional closeness can very well lead to physical . The devil knows how to set that up like nobodies business .   he will do what ever he can to acomplish his goal .

Studies have found that the hormones a foetus is subjected to before birth may well play a part in determining the person's sexuality in later life.\\nThe hypothalamus, a small lobe that hangs down at the base of the brain and is linked to sexual intercourse, has been found to play a significant role. In a study it was proved that the size of the hypothalamus in homosexual men is more alike to the size of a heterosexual females, not a heterosexual male. As the hypothalamus develops before birth it can be argued that homosexuals were 'born that way'. \\nAlso there is statistical evidence to state that homosexuality can be hereditary. It can be passed through the female line (for example, gay man (who has a sister) has a gay nephew through her, and then this gay nephew would in turn have another gay nephew through his sister and so on down the family tree). This means that a homosexual gene is probably passed on through the X chromosome.\\nWith all this evidence it seems doubtful that the origins of homosexuality are anything other than biological, and people who believe otherwise like that guy at that top... urban something are just showing their ignorance.\\nhope that answers your question!

The developement of the Catholic Church makes for interesting historical reading.  Various doctrines to which it holds can be pinpointed to certain dates and people.  For example, the concept of sprinkling instead of immersing for baptism goes to the late 3rd century.  A man named Novatian was on what he thought was his deathbed, and wanted to be baptized, so they sprinkled him. This is the first record of sprinkling in history.  When he recovered, he wanted to be made a bishop.  The entire church was outraged, because they all asserted that he wasn't baptized correctly.  So he was immersed, and became a bishop.  \\n\\nAnother interesting sidebar in the developement of Catholic doctrine was the Quartodeciman controversy, in the middle of the second century.  Because of the Bar Kochba revolt in Palestine, the Roman government forbade all Jews from being anywhere near Jerusalem.  The Sanhedrin was no longer able to produce its religious calendar.  Not only did this impact the Jews, but it impacted Christianity as well, because up to that point the Christians depended upon the Jewish calendar to determine when to observe Passover, to honor the death, burial, and resurrection of Messiah.  So the bishop of Rome (I believe it was Anastasius at the time, I could be wrong, and I am too lazy to look it up), decided that because Messiah was raised on the first day of the week, the Passover would be observed on a Sunday every year.  This eventually developed into Easter.  Anyhow, Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, and the eastern churches initially rejected this move.  Polycarp, who was taught by the Apostle John, said that John told him that Passover must be observed on 14 Nissan every year, regardless of upon what day of the week it fell.  Polycarp did not deny that Christ arose on a Sunday, and Anastasius did not deny that Christ was crucified on Passover, the controversy was about when the Lord's Supper should be observed.\\n\\nThe development of the doctrine that infants are born sinful can be traced back to Augustine, bishop of Hippo, in the mid 4th century.\\n\\nThe introduction of musical instruments can be dated in the 600's A.D.\\n\\nThe developement of the current ecclesiastical arrangement of the Catholic Church is quite fascinating.  Initially, each congregation was autonomous, and governed by a board of men known simply as presbyters (elders).  This office was also known as the episcopoi (overseers/bishops), or poimoine (pastors).  This office was quite distinct from that of the evangelists (preachers) and deacons (ministers/servants).  Anyhow, Ignatius, the bishop of Antioch in the mid to late second century, was the first to suggest that only one of the men be called the episcopos, and the rest called presbyters.  Up to that point, no one presbyter/episcopos had any more authority than any other.  The word episcopos, eventually was shortened to piscops, then to bischop, to our current form of bishop.  The term presbyters was eventually shortened to prester, then prest, and in its current form of priest.  What started to happen was that if a city had several congregations, the bishop of most affluentual of them began to gain authority over the others.  Soon, all the smaller congregations dropped the bishops, but retained their presbyters, and acknowledged the authority of the bishop of the leading congregation in the town.  Soon, there were five prominent congregations throughout Christendom: Jerusalem, Antioch, Constantinople, Alexandria, and Rome, and each of these vied for the prominence, but none was willing to give any foot to the other.  With the advent of the splitting of the Roman Empire into east and west, the barbarian incursions, and the advent of Islam, only two congregations of these powerhouses remained to have any influence: Rome and Constantinople.  The story of their bickering back and forth with each other, and how I believe in 1054, thereabouts (can't remember the exact date), the Bishop of Rome and the

I think that the factual evidence in the core samples drilled from around the world say that the earth does have warm and cool cycles.  I also believe that it is possible that whatever is inhabiting the earth during these cycles will invariably affect them in some way, be it natural or non-natural emissions and/or by-products.\\nI think that if it is "bad" or not is all relative to how you look at it.  Will the weather be worse or more extreme? Possibly.  Is the earth trying to correct any imbalances?  Possibly.  Is this good or bad?  I guess it is how it will affect each individual.
Not everyone is your target market. Demographics allow you to determine your market and the number of your target market in order to verify whether the business can be profitable.\\n\\nOn the Web for example, a website needs to determine the demographics of their visitors -- their age, country, occupation and customer segmentation. These information can help them tailor their content to their audience. A website that attracts baby boomers, for example, would offer a different set of content from those that attract high schoolers.\\n\\nIf you are planning to open a restaurant and you are thinking of a high end fine dining gourmet restaurant. But the demographics of the area where you are planning to open the store shows that the residents in the area are low to middle class income families. Then it doesn't make much sense to open a high end restaurant -- unless you can find a way to bring the high income residents (your target market) to go to a low income place and dine.\\n\\nA catalog business offering men's products may go after professionals earning $100,000 a year, about 30-52 in age, who owns a house and drives a sports car. That's demographics at work.\\n\\nDemographics is an important tool in market segmentation. They are a way for you to find your perfect prospects!

Society tells people that their idea of beauty is a size 7 and blonde. They look down on full figured women as those who have no will power to control their eating and that they need to go on a diet. I've seen some beautiful full figured women and they rock some outfits these skinny chicks can't even surpass. I get stares too when I eat as if I am not entitled to eat a good meal. I've had men compliment me for being sexy at my size and not looking like a bag of bones, but someone who can sit down and get down on a meal like everyone else. I am working on taking some weight down, but even at my size I have guys who say I am fat and ugly when I am not worried about what they think since it's their ignorance doing the talking. I see so many guys pass over a beautiful and intelligent full figured woman for one of these skinny ditzy bimbos just so their friends won't laugh at them.\\n\\nThe sad thing is that a lot of these skinny females don't help things when they get together with their friends and start gawking and laughing at larger women for the fact that they can't get into certain outfits like baby tees and other clothes. Yet they get mad when a BBW gets attention from an attractive man, I had that happen to me before these narrow minded white girls making fun of me for not being able to fit into their clothes, yet I got more attention from the guys who saw me well dressed and put together and not sloppy like these girls were. It's up to us to write the media and start voicing our concerns to them about the images they put out there telling both men and women that certain traits and looks are what will make you more popular.\\n\\nWhat happened to the power of diversity and the unique world we live in, but it won't be that way when we have the film, fashion and music industry defining to us what is beautiful and what is considered sexy. I think the anorexic look has got to go because what man will find some woman with her bones petruding to be sexy? I agree I want to lose the weight without surgery or dangerous drugs. Too many women are not celebrating what God gave them and to accept themselves for how God made them. I have no problem with being a full figured woman since I get mad compliments for the way I carry myself and the stylish clothes I wear and being a lady and not being too out there.\\n\\nAs a full figured woman I am given mad respect for not looking like a dog's chew toy which is what my guy friends refer to skinny women as because I look like a real woman not some starving scarecrow trying to be cute. Do your thing and who cares if some people don't like women like us and are only aiming for eye candy because in the end they're losing out on getting to know a really great person who's full of wonderful, thoughts, ideas, and a sense of humor to match.\\n\\nA lot of men miss out on good women when they pass them over for not having the physical part down meaning she's a size 9. You would be surprised at how many men want to date women like you and me, but don't worry you're a good woman and there's men out there who would be honored to be with a beautiful woman who's got class and style and a great personality. Only ignorant people will base their opinion of what society feels is considered the ideal woman. It's up to us to change the way people think about others especially for their differences and accept the fact that women come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and ethnic backgrounds.

Names of bands should come naturally by something meaningful to the members. Also consider your particular style of music and something you all have in common. \\n\\nHere's a short little story about a band name. For awhile this band was called The Project, then later Reloaded as a sort of joke since 2 of the members were in a band called loaded. One day, while the band was watching a movie the word "Revoultion" came onto the screen. Naturally this jogged the memory of one of the members to a Beatles album, so he said another one "Revolver." Then the singer put "Black Vevlet" in front of it. They later Xed out the "black" and became a very excellent band with a fitting name "Velvet Revolver." Beautiful and Dangerous, just like the band.

It means "life".
Early versions include the line "I dig no Pakistani's." The song began as a commentary about immigration, telling people to "Get Back" to their own countries. It was meant to mock Britain's anti-immigrant proponents. Paul McCartney thought better of it and made the lyrics more obscure.  \\n\\n"Get Back" was going to be the title of the Let It Be album. The concept was The Beatles "getting back" to their roots and playing new songs for a live audience without any studio tricks. This song came closest to capturing that spirit, but the album became something completely different when they decided to scrap the idea of a live album. Glyn Johns, who engineered the sessions was asked to put the album together from what were really rehearsal tapes. After he put the album together, it sat around while the Let It Be Movie was being edited from the film footage of The Beatles rehearsing in the studio and playing on the rooftop. During this time, The Beatles made the Abbey Road album, released it, and broke up. John Lennon had Phil Spector produce his solo song "Instant Karma," which Harrison played on. They liked Spector's work and asked him to produce the Get Back album, which was re-titled Let It Be. Spector took the tapes and added orchestrations using his "Wall Of Sound" technique, and the album that was supposed to be the raw sound of The Beatles returning to their roots was released as a highly-produced final album after they had broken up. \\nIn their early days, The Beatles played in clubs for hours most nights, but by 1967, they stopped touring. This single was advertised as "The Beatles as nature intended." \\nAt the beginning of the album version, Lennon sang, "Sweet Loretta fat she thought she was a cleaner, but she was a frying pan." He was making fun of the first line in the song. \\nAt the end of the album version, Paul says "thanks Mo" in response to Ringo's wife, Maureen, who was clapping. \\nThe press release to promote the single contained this quote from McCartney: "We were sitting in the studio and we made it up out of thin air... we started to write words there and then... when we finished it, we recorded it at Apple Studios and made it into a song to roller coast by." \\nLennon claimed this was basically a rewrite of their 1968 song "Lady Madonna." \\nThe single version is longer than the album version. Usually it is the other way around. \\nPaul looked at Yoko in the studio when he sang the line "get back to where you once belong." John thought he was disrespecting her. \\nMcCartney got the idea for this from the line, "Get back to where you should be," which came from a song Harrison wrote called "Sour Milk Sea," which was eventually recorded by Jackie Lomax. McCartney changed the line to, "Get back to where you once belonged." \\nThe character "JoJo" was probably based on Joseph Melville See Jr., Linda McCartney's first husband. He was from Tucson, Arizona, and killed himself there in 2000. \\nBilly Preston played piano and became the only guest artist to get a credit on a Beatles single when this was credited to "The Beatles with Billy Preston." After George Harrison left the sessions, he saw Preston in concert with Ray Charles. The Beatles met Preston in 1962 when they were both playing in Germany, but they hadn't seen each other since. Harrison asked Preston to come by the studio the next day, where he played on this and "Don't Let Me Down." Having him in the studio eased the tension and made it easier for The Beatles to put personal conflicts aside and record the album.
Lying Comes Naturally to Republicans\\nWhenever Republican politicians find themselves in trouble, their automatic knee-jerk reaction is to blame Democrats. If there is nothing to blame Democrats for, they merely make something up - they lie. This is exactly what the Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman, following the lead of his boss George W. Bush, has done and is doing. He is placing the blame of the mean and punitive House immigration bill on the Democrats, when he knows that it is an outrageous lie.\\n"To be anti- George Bush is to be pro-American," \\n\\n I think he's dangerous, and he has to be stopped." \\n\\nU.S. Troops Killed in Iraq Tops 2,400 <words/latestnews/index.php?id=6682> \\n\\nArticles of Impeachment\\n\\nof\\n\\nPresident George W.

A "little tricky" is putting it mildly, try a little impossible!\\n\\nLosing 15 lbs in a month is totally crazy (a FEW pounds!!??).   Funny how he waited until the last minute to decide on this.\\n\\nA pound of fat contains 3500 calories, so if you lost 1/2 a pound a day you would need to use 1750 calories a day, or the equivalent of running 20 miles.   That also assumes you don't take in more than your basal metabolic rate (very lttle food).  A goal of 5 lbs might be more reasonable.\\n\\nAnyway, try aerobic exercise (running, biking) to burn the calories and some weight work to put on some muscle.\\n\\nOh...and yoga for losing weight and putting on muscle.  Not likely!

Winning Pitcher in a ball game.\\nStarting Pitcher has to leave the ball game with the lead lets say 5-4 at the half way point in which if the game was called due to weather or any other odd thing, 9 innings they call it the 5th Inning so both teams get the same amount of field time. Now he can leave with the lead and the team win and not get it if the other team scores more then what his team had when he left. So if its 6-5 final he would get the no decision and the pitcher who was pitching at the time they scored the winning run would get the win. Easy and clear as mud huh. \\n\\nMain thing to remember is after 5 who ever is pitching for the team that won when the winning run happend. Not the next inning but that inning.

Despite the resistance, insurance companies are finding they must turn to new, unexplored avenues for cost reduction. \\n\\nThe industry has not made an underwriting profit in almost a decade. Up until recently, insurers were able to survive -- and in many cases do quite well -- because they made up losses through investment and asset management income. But 2001 proved to be a turning point. \\n\\nLast year was one of the most dismal underwriting years ever, and the asset management side of the insurance business began to falter due to the sinking stock market and volatility in the credit markets. \\n\\nMoreover, there was increased competitive pressure on insurance firms from financial services companies. \\n\\nInsurers are, of course, embracing all the prescribed measures for tough times, such as tighter underwriting requirements and participation in industry e-commerce endeavors. \\n\\nNevertheless, industry watchers and participants are witnessing a distinct movement toward CRM in the insurance sector as a novel way to beat the odds. \\n\\n"An insurance company is always interested in avoiding loss, whether that loss is paid out through settlements or through excessive administrative overhead," Aberdeen Group research director Denis Pombriant told CRMDaily.

I am grateful that I have such wonderful parents.  They may have been very strict when I was younger (making sure I didn't do drugs, hang out with the wrong crowd or drop out of school).  I am now 23 years old, I have graduated from college, I work a full time and I am getting ready to go back to school for my Masters.  I always thought my parents were ruining my childhood but now I am so thankful.  I know my parents wish they could have helped me pay for college or help me with my bills but I am so happy I grew up the way I did and I would never change my parents for anyone or anything in this whole world!
What's wrong with fiction? If Dan Brown was trying to pass this off as nonfiction, there would be a huge outcry, and rightly so. But I'm an ordained evangelical minister who has absolutely no problem with DVC because it's fiction and Dan Brown has never stated otherwise. If Christians would just go back to the Bible to find out the truth, then the so-called confusion being caused by DVC would be nonexistent. Problem solved.

Only in fiction, TV, and Hollywood. You love a car at 1st sight. A dog at 1st sight. Maybe even a house. But with people it is lust at 1st sight then maybe some love grows out of it. Usually once the hot fire of lust cools the relationship goes South, because there is nothing to anchor it on. If it were love at 1st sight 95% of the people would marry and stay married to those they were dating. That don't happen. Reality sets in and you find out someone is too clingy, too sloppy, too jealous, too lazy, hot headed, has too much baggage etc. If it were love you would look pass ALL of that and want them as Forest Gump wanted Jenny no matter how much they screwed up or rejected you. You would wait forever and endure all for real love. Does that happen? Love at 1st sight only exist in Hollywood, TV, and in the movies.

Hai! Iam a class X student doing this project.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nTHE PROCESS of development along with the expanding globalisation and liberalisation process has increased the number of consumer related issues. Consumer protection has earned an important place in the political, economic and social agendas of many nations. In India, the Government has taken many steps including legislative, to protect consumers. \\nEducation is a life long process of constantly acquiring relevant information, knowledge and skills. Consumer education is an important part of this process and is a basic consumer right that must be introduced at the school level. Consumers by definition include all citizens who are, by and large the biggest group, who are affected by almost all government, public or private decisions. The most important step in consumer education is awareness of consumer rights. However, consumer education is incomplete without the responsibilities and duties of consumers, and this influences individual behaviour to a great extent.\\n\\nDefinition\\nConsumer awareness is making the consumer aware of His/Her rights.\\nConsumer awareness it a marketing term. It means that consumers note or are aware of products or services, its characteristics and the other marketing P's (place to buy, price, and promotion). \\n\\nNeed :\\nwe need it so we will not be misled by producers,it explains if what we buy is worth to our money..and not harmful to us and to environment .\\nMany people are ignorant of their rights to get protected against the exploitation by so many others. So when there is a forum for such redress of grievances there seems to be no such exploitation by many; and becomes a rare one. So in order to get a clear picture of the level of exploitation of consumers, the awareness is required. \\n\\nRole of producers\\nproper labeling, full information, health warnings, handling information, expiration date, etc. keep to requirements, norms, standards\\nlabelproducts according requirements, providing true facts\\nIf they are providing a service they should carry it out with due skill and care. They must also make sure that any materials they provide as part of this service are fit for the purpose.\\nIt is also illegal for a supplier to cut off, or threaten to cut off, supply to a reseller (wholesale or retail) because they have been discounting goods or advertising discounts below prices set by the supplier.

What mail servers are you running and where are the mail databases stored (what kind of storage, not what physical location)? \\n\\nMost commercial, business-grade backup software is email server aware and comes with different API's for the various back-end platforms (MS Exchange, SendMail, GroupWise, etc). The least complicated and most effective solution is to leverage the backup product you already have, and call the appropriate API's to back up your mail databases as part of your regular backup routines.\\n\\nIf you're an end user and not a tech, you won't have the access rights to run a batch file or anything else against the mail server so your only choice is to manually forward the existing emails to a personal account somewhere. That'd be each person forwarding all their own emails. You *may* be able to set up a "rule" to forward any new, incoming mail but you won't be able to forward the existing mail other than manually. And many mail systems block outgoing mail if it's bound for the Internet and has been automatically forwarded, for security reasons.  If I were an end user, I'd check with the IT folks to see what they're doing for backups--- you may be worrying about something that's already been taken care of for you. (I get the feeling there's been a major outage somewhere in the recent past for you?)\\n\\nIf you want to discuss further, feel free to send me a message offline--- click on my avatar then click the "Send email" link (or whatever it says).  Especially if you are a tech. I am positively frightened for you, if you don't have a current backup mechanism in place for your emails.

the current policy of the DOT (department of Transportation) is to "allow" transportation of radio active waste or "spent" radioactive fuel in DOT approved tanks by rail or truck only. State policy also requires that such storage or transportation be escorted by police or private security and in the the case of crossing state line more than likely a military escort. Of course this would also be approved by all the counties that the transportation would enter. The best and safest way would be to let the military handle all handling of, storage and transportation. By truck, at night only.

She is scared to death of you and of loving you right now because you hurt her deeply.  You chose to leave her rather than stick it out and work through this issue.  That creates a giant trust issue in your relationship.  Now she probably is scared that any time you two argue you are just going to walk out and leave her.  She is probably also thinking that even though you say you are now ok with not having kids that at some point you are going to regret never having kids and blame her.  So she thinks it is better just to go ahead and end this so you can have the kids you want and you can both be happy without each other.

You said that you're bored and unmotivated with your life, so possibly it's a mild case of depression...?  If you think that may be the case, you should consult your physician.\\n\\nIf you don't think you're dealing with depression, making the following changes might help you feel more awake:\\n\\n1) Don't take a nap in the late afternoon or evening (probably not past about 3 PM); If you absolutely need to nap, limit it to a simple power nap of about 20 minutes.\\n\\n2) If you drink a lot of caffeine, cut back (or maybe even stop drinking it all together).\\n\\n3) Work out harder and for a longer period of time (and finish at least 2-3 hours before your bed time).  It will probably help you fall asleep and stay asleep better.\\n\\n4) Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.\\n\\n5) If you're waking up throughout the night or not feeling rested after 7-8 hours of straight sleep, you might want to think about replacing your mattress.  (This one was the one that helped me start sleeping better and feeling less tired).\\n\\n6) Expose yourself to more natural light.  Physiologically speaking, your internal (circadian) clock should respond to the difference in light throughout the day, making you more sleepy the darker it becomes and more awake the lighter it becomes.\\n\\n7) Create a sleep-time ritual for yourself.  The last half hour or hour before you want to go to sleep, make your space more quiet, warm, and inviting.  Cut out as many distractions as possible in that time frame -- turn off the TV or stereo and turn off unnecessary lights.  Slip into comfy PJ's.  This way, your body will begin to recognize when it is time to go into a sleep mode.\\n\\n8) Don't use a snooze button on your alarm.  You won't get any restful sleep if you wake yourself up every 10 minutes with a loud buzz.\\n\\n9) Don't eat within 2 hours of your bed time.  If you get the munchies in that timeframe, make yourself something like a hot glass of tea with a lemon wedge instead.\\n\\n10) In addition to eating a healthy diet, take a daily multi-vitamin to ensure that you're body is getting the nutrients it needs.\\n\\nIf these don't help, talk to a doctor -- s/he would be able to run tests to detect if you have an underlying problem causing the sleepiness.\\n\\nGood luck!

First of all, I would get a NEW family doctor. What you have, is probably Pleurisy. Here are the symptoms: it hurts to breath deeply or cough. You may also have severe,but one-sided,chest pain.The symptoms are accompanied by others that are associated with the underlying disorder. The pain will disappear if pleural effusion occurs as a result of pleurisy, because fluid will prevent the roughened or inflamed  layers of the pleura from rubbing against each other. If this happens, you may become BREATHLESS! You need to see a doctor, have your lungs "sounded' and a "chest x-ray" the x-ray will determine what caused this. If you are not allergic to Aspirin, this is the recommendation. Aspirin will ease your pain. Go NOW and get your lungs tested. Better to be safe then sorry.

Why do you look like you're from india? (thats not for all black people, just you)
sahara\\n\\nSahara (suhâr'u) [key][Arab.,=desert], world's largest desert, c.3,500,000 sq mi (9,065,000 sq km), N Africa; the western part of a great arid zone that continues into SW Asia. Extending more than 3,000 mi (4,830 km), from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea, the Sahara is bounded on the N by the Atlas Mts., steppelands, and the Mediterranean Sea; it stretches south c.1,200 mi (1,930 km) to the Sahel, a steppe in W and central Africa that forms its southern border. The desert includes most of Western Sahara, Mauritania, Algeria, Niger, Libya, and Egypt; the southern portions of Morocco and Tunisia; and the northern portions of Senegal, Mali, Chad, and Sudan. The E Sahara is usually divided into three regions—the Libyan Desert, which extends west from the Nile valley through W Egypt and E Libya; the Arabian Desert, or Eastern Desert, which lies between the Nile valley and the Red Sea in Egypt; and the Nubian Desert, which is in NE Sudan.\\n\\nRegions of sand dunes (erg) occupy only about 15% of the Sahara; “stone deserts,” consisting of plateaus of denuded rock (hammada) or areas of coarse gravel (reg), cover about 70% of the region; mountains, oases, and transition zones account for the remainder. Sparse vegetation is found in most parts of the Sahara, with the exception of the sand dune regions. High mountain massifs rise in the central regions; they are the Ahagger (Hoggar) in S Algeria, which rises to more than 9,000 ft (2,740 m); the Tibesti Massif in N Chad, which rises to more than 11,000 ft (3,350 m); and the Aïr Mountains (Azbine) in N Niger, which rise to more than 6,000 ft (1,830 m). The mountains are deeply dissected and were in the past infamous for the shelter they provided to marauders preying on desert traffic. From west to east the four principal land routes across the desert are from Colomb-Bechar to Dakar; from Colomb-Bechar to Gao and Timbuktu by way of Reganne; from Touggourt to Agadez and Kano by way of In-Salah; and from Tripoli to Ghat.

I doubt if he has a clue yet where it is going.  \\n\\nHold off a little longer.  Next time he brings up some event in the future, then I would ask where he sees your relationship going.  But, you know, people change their minds at anytime in a relationship - no guarantees.\\n\\nI definitely understand your wanting to know if it's long term.  And the more time you spend together the faster you'll know.  In the meantime, there are lots of things you can do to get closer.....it will just enhance the anticipation when you finally do feel ready for sex!!
if you have been doing any sort of regular exercise, this can be expected.  depending on your age, it's most likely just your metabolism.  it tends to speed up when we're younger.  at the risk of sounding rude, enjoy it while it lasts as it does tend to slow down over time.
I think for most sensitive girls (I would say I am one) I think it is best done like a band-aid - really. A lot of the time we fake that we are sensitive and vulnerable so guys feel they can't leave us. Also, how do you know that she doesnt doubt the relationship as well. Above all - you need to tell her how you feel. I can guarentee that is the only way to go forward. And when you tell her, just say 'we need to talk about us' so she knows exactly what is coming.

Putting in an inflated bill and hoping no-one asks too many questions.
Can we have an infinite universe for example? The answer is no, the universe is finite. Stephen Hawking in 'A Brief History of Time' (1989 page 44) describes the universe as being "finite but unbounded". The simplest answer is that as the universe is known to be expanding, it cannot possibly be infinite. To be precise, the dictionary definition of the word universe is "all that is. The whole system of things." In this sense the universe is not expanding into anything other than itself, for whatever it is expanding into is part of the universe, there being nothing else but the universe. However, for the sake of simplicity, I am referring only to our Big Bang expanding universe as 'the universe'. (Even if you happen to disagree with the Big Bang theory, the term 'universe' will still have the same meaning here, as it refers to 'our' universe only, and does not include whatever may or may not exist outside of it.)

A man can not condemn his brother for his sins, and expect forgiveness for his own sins.
NASA can put an end to this debate by allowing an indenpendent group of scientist to view the Moon from an Earth bound telescope, or use the Hubble telescope.  There is a telescope powerful enough to view the Moon in Chile.  However, you can rent time on this telescope to view space, but unfortunately, you are restricted from looking at the moon.  What are they hiding?  Why won't the US Gov't allow indenpendent scientists to view the Moon with US owned Earth bound telescopes?  Becasue there is nothing on the Moon.  China is preparing to send a man to the Moon by 2012.  Dick Cheney has said on the record that the US needs to get back to the Moon.  Why?  Will the Chinese be the first to put a man on the Moon?\\nFrom a logical standpoint, why has no one been to the Moon in the past 30 years?  A lot of people are basing their opinions on nothing but emotion.  It takes scientific evidence to prove your point.  NASA is covering this up by stonewalling independent scientists from viewing the Moon.  However, the truth will eventually come out.  How will this reflect on the US?
I am a Christian too and i understand where you are coming from.\\n\\nThe fact is that there can be no true love is there is no free will. How can you claim to love your wife if she cannot decide on her own what to do. She has to ask for permission before she can do anything, that won't be true love.\\nThe kind of relationship God has with us as his children is different from the kind we have with our own, remember the bible says if we who are evil know how to give good gift to our children, how much more will God give good things to those who ask him.\\n\\nIf you had the power God has and his wisdom, i am sure you will have done the same. By the time you have stopped about 1 million people from doing what they want to do, even though you know its the best for them, they would label you a bully and a wicked god. If you think well about it, it is wiser to allow people decide what they want to do. They won't have the luxury of blaming you. Look at the case of Adam for example, he blamed God for giving him eve, that's why God now allows us to choose.

He wants to have his cake and eat it too.  He wants you to move out so that he can have a place to bring other women.  When he gets a chance and doesn't have anything better going on, he'll come see you for sex.  Move out and don't tell him where you are going.  That is just unacceptable.  Don't be his doormat.
The sever always says their score first. If you do it the other way it confuses everyone.
I can understand how he would feel hurt and angry towards you, however, since he chose to stay with you after finding out, he needs to come to terms with his feelings.  If he can't then he's not being fair to you or to himself.  He either needs to let it go, or if he can not, then he needs to let you go.
Tower of Pisa\\nThe tilting of the structure is not new. Soon after this 800-year-old campanile (free standing bell tower) was begun, workers noticed a risky inclination caused by soft subsoil. Partial remedies were applied and the architecturally flawed tower was completed about 70 years later.\\nOver the centuries the tilt angle of the 56-meter (182-feet) tall Leaning Tower of Pisa continued to increase. Today the top edge lists about 5 meters (16 feet) from the perpendicular, creating a gravity-defying appearance.\\nSome experts predict an any-year-now collapse, others believe that the current restoration project will save this world wonder.
Yeah, you're talking to one.
I'm from London and certainly remember this in my schooldays (60s/70s) though I used to shout "Fains!" or "Fains I!"\\n\\nSee the following:\\n\\n" : 'Feign Knights' is a phrase used by children in Kent, England, UK. I grew up using this phrase as did all my childhood friends. It was used whilst playing tag games and you crossed your fingers saying 'feign knights' and it meant no one could tag you, you were safe, immune from being caught in the game. I now live in Gloucestershire and they do not use this phrase here and have not even heard of it.\\n\\n: I can certainly confirm that it is used in Kent - I live there (though I am not a native) but I always thought it was spelled 'fainites': I have to confess I am not at all sure about that, as it is not often one sees it written down.\\n\\n: It was certainly not used where I grew up - my childhood being divided between the Republic of Ireland and schools in Kent and Berkshire.\\n\\n: Another peculiarly Kentish usage seems to be 'Monkey Peas' for woodlice.\\n\\n: DFG\\n\\nThere is an interesting thread on "faynights" at rootsweb.com (link below). People from the London area mostly, and some Aussies, recall variations like Faynights, Fanites, Fanelights, Vainites, Venites, etc. The most cogent explanation offered by a poster draws on the Shorter Oxford Dictionary (of which I do not have a copy)which says that the expression is from "Fains I" or "Fains it". "Fain" is taken to be a childhood slang term meaning to claim an exemption from some penalty. \\n\\nThe SOD apparently says that the etymology of "fane" is unknown, so I feel free to speculate that it may be from the archaic English word "fane" meaning a temple, shrine or sanctuary."

I take it that it must be sold on prescription and you are trying to get it on the doctor's recommended list? Are you legally entitled to sell this product? If so, the clinical trials and research findings would be your best tool. Talk to someone at a medical publishing/advertising agency like Adis International. Doctor's are notoriously bribable, but this is expensive and not very moral or efficient.
Hey CORE,\\n\\nWhile I don't agree with you on the Biblical issues, I definitely agree with you on the rest of your statement.  One thing that I would add though, is that it is not just we Christians that do that.  I have seen my fair share of "baiting" from the athiests, agnostics, Muslims, and every other group that think that they "have it right."\\n\\nAnyway, thanks for making a good point, and here's to disagreeing without being disagreeable.

The basic test is free, and it will sort you into a type, such as INTJ, that can be associated with occupations.

Believe it or not your parents are looking out for your best interest. As you become older you will realize that your parents weren't trying to control you but just preparing you for your future. Let's say right now you decide to take things to next level with someone you are in a relationship with and she becomes pregnant...guess what life is about to become 1000 x's harder.when you are young your way of thinking is alot different than when you turn let's say 27. Your idea and views about love and life will change. They just want to make sure that when you do make a VERY important life changing decision that you are really ready!

Yes, I think Chloe deserved it. I think Santino was way too out there in his designs and much to stubborn when it came to interpreting what the judges wanted from the challenges, which ultimately gives an idea as to how he would work with clients. Daniel was good and had very refreshing designs. However, his inexperience shined through at the fashion show. Chloe was the strongest out of all three.
Global warming is the observed increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans in recent decades. (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/global%20warming ). It is mostly man-made and comes from everything from factories to cars. (http://www.epa.gov/ebtpages/airairpoglobalwarming.html )Almost every single real scientific study links global warming directly to humans.\\n\\nIt's only certain political figures that don't want to change for reasons easily guessable. That is why the whole developed world signed that Kyoto Treaty and why every single developed country is working to reduce their polluting of the air, water, and land. \\n\\nSee the new Gore movie, it has the backing of the scientific AND POLITICAL groups: \\n\\nScientific community: http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/200...\\n\\nGovernment Groups:\\n\\nNOAA (National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration) on why Peer-Reviewed Journals are the only real scientific studies to be believed: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/globalwar...\\n\\nThe EPA's site for KIDS: http://www.epa.gov/globalwarming/kids/in...\\n\\nFrom NASA:\\nhttp://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/library...\\n\\nThe Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program is an important part of the U.S. Department of Energy's strategy to understand global climate change:\\nhttp://education.arm.gov/studyhall/warmi...\\n\\nhttp://globalchange.gov/\\nhttp://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/climate.s...\\nhttp://marine.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/locator?s...\\nhttp://www.usaid.gov/our_work/environmen...\\nhttp://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalwarming.html\\n\\nAll of the above are .gov sites.\\n\\nEdit: \\n\\nNotice how the person below me offers no evidence what-so-ever.  That is exactly what is holding us back in taking real steps in fixing this very easily fixable problem.  All people like this due is try to poke holes in something that is already rock-solid in ALL REAL SCIENTIFIC (GOVERNMENT) COMMUNITIES. Hollywood, Gore, or anyone else who has made this up.  It is our own government organizations, working separately, that have all come to the same conclusion.  The people who don't believe offer nothing but opinions and fake studies done by non-governmental - or none-peer reviews - organizations.\\n\\nIt is a real problem that can be fixed with easy measures.

Proctor and Gamble, not because you will make a killing tomorrow nor because Warren Buffett just bought some of it.  Think about it, they sell consumer necessities which are consumable.  Things that everybody buys and has to keep re-buying when it runs out.  We are talking about soap, toothpaste, shampoo, throw away razors, laundry detergent, dish detergent, toilet paper, coffee, diapers, hair care...well you get the picture.  People may cut a lot of expenses when times are tough, but these are the basics that get cut the least.

The first step is to prepare a business plan. Even if you will not be applying for a bank loan, a business plan helps you to think through your business - what it needs, who it will benefit, how much it will cost, and what is its potential. Here are free business plans on childcare business that you may want to look into:\\n\\nhttp://www.sba.gov/library/pubs/mp-30.doc\\nhttp://www.misbtdc.org/documents/BPWORKBK.pdf\\nhttp://www.misbtdc.org/documents/CDCPLAN.pdf\\nhttp://sbdcnet.utsa.edu/sbic/bplans.htm \\n\\nYou may want to read the free article "How To Start Your Own Day Care Center" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol40/daycare.htm It covers various aspects of starting and running a daycare center including the demand for daycare centers, how to start this business, shoestring strategies, how to operate a daycare center, tips on caring for the children, income potential, how to manage your daycare, marketing your business and other additional income potential. There are so many things to learn about the business that the first step is to read everything you can find.\\n\\nFor in-depth information, I suggest checking out the following books:\\n\\n- Start and Run a Profitable Home Day Care \\n- The Daycare Provider's Workbook \\n- Start Your Own At-Home Child Care Business \\n- So You Want to Open a Profitable Child Care Center : \\nEverything You Need to Know to Plan, Organize and Implement a Successful Program \\n\\nIt is also important that you learn the tax rules affecting daycare centers, especially if you are going to open one from your home. Here is the IRS page on child care centers: http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/industries/content/0,,id=99878,00.html\\n\\nAs for the licenses and requirements in your state, the Administration for Children and Families provide a state by state listing of contacts for licensing and regulations governing child care businesses:\\nhttp://www.nccic.org/statedata/dirs/regoffic.html

Heck - his family wouldn't even take him seriously that he just wanted to kill himself, and they wouldn't even spend the day with him in his "last hours". So he sought out some quack-pot doctor for assisted suicide.  He was detremined to finish himself off!\\n\\nAs he settled into his cot, totally prepared to die and be put out of his misery, the power went out, the suicide machine broke and everyone left the building...but as usual, Grampa had no clue.\\n\\nSo -- a moment or two later, he opened his eyes --HAPPY THAT IS WAS OVER -- and went joyfully running down the streets in his hospital gown with his bum uncovered, enjoying all the children laughing and playing loving all the little birdies singing -- presumably in Heaven!\\nHe marveled at how similar "Heaven" was to his old earthly town of Springfield...even some of the faces looked familiar...He didn't question any of it, until he got to the Spaghetti house and saw his ungrateful son, Homer, there with his family, at which point he asked, "How come you're dead, too??" \\n\\nPoor Grandpa Simpson was SO disappointed.\\n\\n "Those were the happiest 5 minutes of my life, because I thought I was dead," he said as he longingly stared out the window at the beautiful clouds and birdies playing. "For once I actually enjoyed my life, because I FORGOT how miserable and how very AFRAID I WAS and I finally JUST STARTED LIVING."\\n\\nI hope you find what you truly need.\\nLove & Light.

video games are fun, rather than try to get between him why not jump in and be a video game buddy for him. if a girl sat down and played video games along side me without any request on my part i'd probably ask her to marry me hahahaha, but seriously, guys are taught since birth to be like superheros to be strong and wise and to save the day. well in video games we can do that all the time, isn't that nice.
Mmm well he prolly still has some feelings for her but im pretty sure hes not gonna go back out w. her since he was the one to brake up  in the first place..Soo in my opinion i think u should jsut talk to him more.

Soo he can see the real you..And totally forget about his cheating ex..As you can see shes trying to win him back and all you can doo is not let that happenen by talkin/flirtin =] It'll work out cause he knows how she is. but he still has to see how u are. Ooolala. Haha
America needs more political parties, a true representation of the make up of its people. If all your elected officials are rich white males, that usually hail from greedy,  repressed, right winged, red necked , fundamentalist families,  whom in most cases  hail  from the deep south and Midwest then Americas plot can  only continue to erode . \\nI do not mean to imply that Europeans are much different, after all the apple does not fall to far from the tree. and therefore  America will remain  the way that it  has always been, Racist Warmongering and Ignorant,  And as long as the Bush's and Kerry's keep being born with all the money and power , regardless of their mental capacities or moral turpitude  then the good citizens of America will  have  very little choice other than to remain ignorant,  afraid,  and poor of spirit. and accept whats on offer.\\n\\nAmericans must get out from in front of their TVs and off their lazy, fat asses and revolt take charge of their own destiny. because  "THE REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED"

Isiah Thomas will go down in history as the worst executive in the history of sports.  Not just basketball, but in the history of sports.  Take a look across the river at Rod Thorn with the Nets.

In its original meaning it comes from the US military immediately following WWI. Strangely though, the term was never used to describe anyone - only in order to deny that any such servicemen existed. This bulletin was issued by the U.S. Command on Public Information in March 1919, on behalf of Major General M. W. Ireland, the U.S. Surgeon General:\\n\\n"The Surgeon General of the Army ... denies ... that there is any foundation for the stories that have been circulated ... of the existence of 'basket cases' in our hospitals."\\n\\nThis bulletin was reported on in many U.S. newspapers at the time. Many of them also defined what was meant by 'basket case'. For example, this from the New York paper, The Syracuse Herald, Mar 1919:\\n\\n"By 'basket case' is meant a soldier who has lost both arms and legs and therefore must be carried in a basket.\\n\\nGiven that the term was originally reserved for incapacitated servicemen, there wasn't much call for it until the next major war of English-speaking peoples - WWII. Again, it comes from the U.S. military and again in the form of a denial from the Surgeon General. In May 1944, in 'Yank', the then Surgeon General, Major General Norman T. Kirk, said:\\n\\n"... there is nothing to rumors of so-called 'basket cases' - cases of men with both legs and both arms amputated."\\n\\nClearly, given the scale of the casualties in both wars, there must have been cases of multiple amputation. It isn't recorded what term the U.S. Surgeon General used to describe these - clearly not 'basket case'.
I hope these websites helps, good luck.
The only way to get over this and start over is with open communication.  If you two are communicating well then he should have no reason to be going behind your back to talk to anyone else.  You need to develop a relationship and you each have to listen to what the other needs and wants in a relationship and figure out how to make that happen so that you two need each other and depend upon each other instead of looking to other people.
maybe on www.overstock.com. course they've got some random stuff on there so maybe not but it's worth a try.

You might first want to look up Monty Python or Monty Python Flying Circus on Yahoo! videos to see if you like their humor.  It's British, but extremely eccentric.  Next, their is any movie by Mel Brooks (e.g. The History of the World Part I, Young Frankenstein, Robin Hood, Men in Tights, etc. etc.), or you could try Airplane! (that one is hilarious!)\\nIf you can, and are a fan of zombie movies, try and watch Shaun of the Dead.  Great!!  It makes fun of the old zombie movies, and even includes such classic lines as "They're coming to get you Barbara!" (from the original black and white Night of the Living Dead).  Great Stuff.

Alright, let's revise this joke so we can relieve the good old laugh:\\n\\nLittle April was not the best student in Sunday school. \\nUsually she slept through the class. \\n\\nOne day the teacher called on her while she was napping, "Tell me, April, who created the universe?" \\n\\nWhen April didn't stir, little Johnny, a boy seated in the chair behind her, took a pin and jabbed her in the rear. "GOD ALMIGHTY!" shouted April and the teacher said, "Very good" and April fell back asleep. \\n\\nA while later the teacher asked April, "Who is our Lord and Saviour," But, April didn't even stir from her slumber. Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again. 'JESUS CHRIST!" shouted April and the teacher said, "very good," and April fell back to sleep. \\n\\nThen the teacher asked April a third question. "What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?" And again, Johnny jabbed her with the pin. This time April jumped up and shouted, "IF YOU STICK THAT F*****G THING IN ME ONE MORE TIME, I'LL BREAK IT IN HALF AND STICK IT UP YOUR A$$!"
Who knows. Hopefully it will come out because many people are wondering. Was he molesting the kids? You just never know. I feel sorry for her, she is in jail today, too bad she could not have got help.

OMG - WHERE on earth did Meshelle get her information?!\\n\\n  Cellulose is an indigestible fiber that can be ingested. Cellulose itself does not absorb fat. It passes through your digestive system relatively unchanged.  Cellulose is used by many dieters because it add's "bulk" to the system and makes you feel full. It is also widely used in fiber-type laxatives (like Fibercon)\\n\\nThere are compounds that do absorb fat - available only by PRESCRIPTION (The drug is called Xenical and will absorb about 30% of dietary fat in the colon).  There are lots of over the counter diet aids that will claim to absorb fat (Chitosan is one) but clinical trials have proven that this is an out and out lie.  They can continue to claim this in their advertising though because they are considered "dietary supplements" and not drugs. Don't waste your money.\\n\\nNow CELLULITE, is another story. It's the dimpled areas on our butts and thighs. It causes by a tightening of the connective tissue the crisscrosses everyone's fat.  It is hereditary and gets worse as we age. It can be broken down mechanically by a process called ENDERMOLOGY. (Basically a big vibrating roller is massaged across the areas to break down the cellulite.

As interest rates fall people will refinance at the new lower rates. Investors in mortgage backed securities with have their principal returned to them early. This is known as "reinvestment risk", as investors will have to find a new place for the money and the interst rates will be lower. CMO's try to midigate this risk by establishing trantches (www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tranches.asp).\\n\\nAs interest rates rise pre-payments will decline reducing reinvestment risk. However, the investor will still be exposed to interest rate risk. Meaning that new issues of mortgage backed securities will offer higher returns. The rates of default will increase for marginal borrowers with adjustable rates. In most cases this won't affect the investor, as the bank will foreclose and liquidate the asset. In both cases you will have credit risk, but this in minor, as they are backed by the assets (properties).\\n\\n* Use this information at your own risk. Consult your financial advisor.
I'm assuming you mean literature. Most Authors are liberals and they find ways to make their ideas look good. An example of this is the book from the 60's, Peyton Place. In the book, a man is committing incest with his daughter and the author manipulates us into cheering the doctor who performs an illegal abortion on her when she gets pregnant. What isn't brought up is the fact that her father could have been stopped if it was known that she was pregnant. Since it wasn't reported, he got away with it. Also, the humanity and innocence of the baby is totally ignored.      \\nP.S. I LOVE spell check!

Oh, yes, you really got that right: democracy is way more controlling than communism!\\n\\nEinstein uncovered one of worst aspects of a democratic society: "Did you know the microphones on your home and cell phones can be activated to listen in on you at home?" Oh, my gosh, can you just imagine that?? Yes, definitely worse than communism!\\n\\nWell, did you know that in communist countries they ACTUALLY did that that -  quite a lot of people had their houses bugged with microphones - every word they were saying was being monitored. People could not trust anyone. Not even their families as the informers of the Secret Police were everywhere. The safe way was to keep your mouth shut. This unless you wanted to spend a few nights in interrogation.\\n \\nInterrogation wasn’t that bad. Those guys only wanted to ask you a few nice questions, just to get to know you better. Yes, they made sure they will leave you with an unforgettable experience. They played with your nerves and, ok, some people who seemed to be strong-natured individuals would often burst out crying, but those of tears of joy! I mean...wouldn’t you be more than happy knowing that you would lose your job and have a bad record? Of course you would, that would happen to you if you were lucky. You could have very well been sent to prison to be “re-educated”.
After dating my GF for a few months she said she loved me and then asked me if I loved her.  I was honest and said I don't know.  I told her I liked her a lot, but I don't throw the world "love" around like most people.  When I say it I truly mean it and that I didn't know her well enough to say it.  She was a bit upset at the time, but a few months later when I did, she was really happy.  Be honest, I'd rather have someone tell me they didn't love me, than find out a while down the road.

Everyone who said the Braves is correct. They have actually reached the postseason every year from 1991 to 2005, except for 1994. As someone mentioned earlier, nobody made the postseason in '94 because of the strike. But the Braves can still claim 14 straight division titles.

With some of the best beaches and diving spots in the world, it is ideal for island getaways. Experience Asia in Malaysia.
A clue is if they seem really unhappy with each other.  Maybe you should talk to them.  It could be that they don't realize how upset you are, and even though they may not be thinking of divorce, they may rethink what they are doing wrong.
No.  Children's physiology is different from adults and arterial plaqueing does not start to form until the teenage years.  It would be like screening the elderly for sexually transmitted diseases...lots of screening with very little result.\\n\\nThe problem is not that we are not finding heart disease if we are looking, its that there are plenty of people in their 50's and 60's who think that smoking, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, diabetes, and a strong family history are nothing to worry about...and oh yeah, this chest tightness isn't that bad, therefore it must not be anything.  On the other hand you have perfectly healthy 20 year olds every day on this forum wondering if that sharp pain in their chest might be a heart attack.\\n\\nIn sum education would go much, much farther than routine screening for an inappropriate population.

Hope this helps.\\n\\nProtestants often misunderstand the Catholic teaching on merit, thinking that Catholics believe that one must do good works to come to God and be saved. This is exactly the opposite of what the Church teaches. The Council of Trent stressed: "[N]one of those things which precede justification, whether faith or works, merit the grace of justification; for if it is by grace, it is not now by works; otherwise, as the Apostle [Paul] says, grace is no more grace" (Decree on Justification 8, citing Rom. 11:6). \\n\\nPaul tells us: "For [God] will reward every man according to his works: to those who by perseverance in working good seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life. There will be . . . glory and honor and peace for every one who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek. For God shows no partiality" (Rom. 2:6–11; cf. Gal. 6:6–10). \\n\\nIn the second century, the technical Latin term for "merit" was introduced as a synonym for the Greek word for "reward." Thus merit and reward are two sides of the same coin. \\n\\n\\nThe Catholic Church teaches only Christ is capable of meriting in the strict sense—mere man cannot (Catechism of the Catholic Church 2007). The most merit humans can have is condign—when, under the impetus of God’s grace, they perform acts which please him and which he has promised to reward (Rom. 2:6–11, Gal. 6:6–10). Thus God’s grace and his promise form the foundation for all human merit (CCC 2008). \\n\\nVirtually all of this is agreed to by Protestants, who recognize that, under the impetus of God’s grace, Christians do perform acts which are pleasing to God and which God has promised to reward, meaning that they fit the definition of merit. When faced with this, Protestants are forced to admit the truth of the Catholic position—although, contrary to Paul’s command (2 Tim. 2:14), they may still dispute the terminology. \\n\\nThus the Lutheran Book of Concord admits: "We are not putting forward an empty quibble about the term ‘reward.’ . . . We grant that eternal life is a reward because it is something that is owed—not because of our merits [in the strict sense] but because of the promise [of God]. We have shown above that justification is strictly a gift of God; it is a thing promised. To this gift the promise of eternal life has been added" (p. 162). \\n\\nThe following passages illustrate what the Church Fathers had to say on the relationship between merit and grace. \\n\\n  \\nIgnatius of Antioch\\n\\n\\n\\n"Be pleasing to him whose soldiers you are, and whose pay you receive. May none of you be found to be a deserter. Let your baptism be your armament, your faith your helmet, your love your spear, your endurance your full suit of armor. Let your works be as your deposited withholdings, so that you may receive the back-pay which has accrued to you" (Letter to Polycarp 6:2 [A.D. 110]). \\n\\n  \\nJustin Martyr\\n\\n\\n\\n"We have learned from the prophets and we hold it as true that punishments and chastisements and good rewards are distributed according to the merit of each man’s actions. Were this not the case, and were all things to happen according to the decree of fate, there would be nothing at all in our power. If fate decrees that this man is to be good and that one wicked, then neither is the former to be praised nor the latter to be blamed" (First Apology 43 [A.D. 151]). \\n\\n  \\nTatian the Syrian\\n\\n\\n\\n"[T]he wicked man is justly punished, having become depraved of himself; and the just man is worthy of praise for his honest deeds, since it was in his free choice that he did not transgress the will of God" (Address to the Greeks 7 [A.D. 170]). \\n\\n  \\nAthenagoras\\n\\n\\n\\n"And we shall make no mistake in saying, that the [goal] of an intelligent life and rational judgment, is to be occupied uninterruptedly with those objects to which the natural reason is chiefly

At the school I teach at some kids can go into Anaphylaxis shock from the strangest things and they don;t even have to touch them (just be in the same area in some instances):\\n\\nLatex, fish, excersize, foods, nuts, medicines etc.\\n\\nBut there are some cases that no reason or link can be made -\\n\\nUnknown: A substantial proportion of sufferers have no cause found despite all efforts, even in the most expert clinics. Doctors call such unexplained attacks 'idiopathic anaphylaxis' The word 'idiopathic' in practice means we don't know the cause. Worrying as it is, death from this is very rare indeed. However, there must be a cause or causes. Some cases are bound to be simple failure to find a cause and I always regard this diagnosis as provisional, but if a recognised allergy specialist has given you this label it is unlikely that another specialist will do any better. The explanation is NOT psychological in the vast majority. So in most cases this is a disease for which medical science has not yet discovered the cause. Some top experts who have studied hundreds of patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis believe that it is a disorder of mast cells, causing them to release histamine and chemicals with similar actions too easily. There is an excellent book on this condition, quite short, and intended for doctors and patients.

7-14 days they say. As far as when it is contagious it is a virus and is spread by sneezing, coughing and not washing hands. It's contagious as soon as you come in contact with the germ.  This doesn't mean that you will get the cold, most people with a healthy immune system can ward off the common cold. However, if your immune system is depleted it will normally take a good hold of ya.  I hope this answers your question.

The New Testament teaches of Christ's coming and His instruction to establish His church - I believe there is actually a verse that states "the Churches of Christ salute you" but I can't seem to locate it just now - In answer to your question the bible only refers to Christ's church which was established by the apostles - read the book of Acts - after the Holy Spirit came on the day of Pentecost - and the apostles began the work of preaching the gospel and establishing Christ's church -

Protons consist of 3 pair quarks, 2 up quarks and a down.\\nElectrons are not made up of quarks, so there are not made up of the stuff protons are.\\n\\nEnergy is matter in motion/velocity.\\n--There are many types of energy, not all of it is "matter in motion".  Potential energy is an example.\\n\\nNeutrons are a ghost image of the interaction between electrons and protons.\\n--Well, kinda of yes, kind of no.\\nIf you combine a proton and an electron, you will produce a neutron and a neutrino.  This is no easy to acheive but it does happen (in neutron stats).\\n\\nLight is made up of photons.\\n--Yes, but light is BOTH a wave AND a particle.\\n\\nPhotons are matter at some velocity.\\n--No, photons are not matter, thet do not have mass.\\n\\nAll matter is light from a certain point of view. \\n--No.\\nMatter can still exist in complete darkness.\\n\\nMathematics combined with the periodic table is the explanation of why chemical reactions happen.\\nChemical attraction and repultion can be explained via matematics and the periodic table. \\n--I prefer the Physics way of thinking of it, but if you want to call it math, thats OK too.\\n\\nEverything that is, everything that we see, is either here or not. On or off, yes or no, matter or not matter; That is the question! \\n--Now your thinking like a computer.

it depends on what you plan on doing with the processor but i personally perfer the sempron processors over a pentium any day they will be more compatable later. in my opinion i believe that you should stay with the sempron but when a better verson comes out of the product go for it stay away form the evil pentium
Well, that is a complex question. I personally like how MLB functions in the sense that a manager can go out there and argue with the ump. But not if it holds up the game for too long. The important thing is to keep the game moving along at all times. Baseball managers have a respect for the game and know when to leave the field after they either lose the argument (and they will ALWAYS lose) or are ejected. It's about respect. But I wonder if arguing were allowed all across the board in all sports if the players would have respect for the officiating crew. In other words, would they argue to the point where they would be abusive and have to be physically removed from the court or field? Call me crazy, but I think an NBA or NFL player just might argue to that point if arguing were allowed. I am surprised that I haven't really seen a physical ejection in baseball.
Rather than measure per minute it would be better to measure by game or by frame, or more accurately per ball thrown. The only workout will be getting up picking up your ball and chucking it down the alley. It will depend on how you do it too. An old guy will stand out there by the line, swing his body and let go. A young pro will stand with his heels dangling off the back taking 5 giant steps and grunting louder than a footabll cheerleader caught in a tackle as he hurks it out there at 25 miles an hour. \\n\\nYou can get someone to give you a table that shows estimates, but that estimate will vary wildly. Are there 5 people on your lane for that hour so they slowed you down, etc. \\n\\nHere is what I would do to estimate. Its 12 feet from the first dots or 15 feet from the second, those feet I do twice as much workout as normal walking cause I am carrying a 16 pound ball and walking funny. The rest of the feet from the seat to the ball and back I walk normal. I get about 4 strikes per game average so in 10 frames I throw 2 balls 6 times one ball 4 times. \\n\\nThe walking trips from:\\n the seat to the ball 15 ft\\n bowl is 12ft for me times 2\\n  the end back to the ball 12ft\\n  bowl again 12ft times 2\\n back to my seat 15ft alley plus 15ft to seat\\n\\n so either 69ft per strike or 105 ft per spare/open.\\n\\neach game then is 6*105+4*69= 906ft or about 1/6th a mile\\n\\nmy treadmill says I burned about 22 calories in a sixth of a mile, so that would be my estimate, 22 calories per game. \\n\\nIf the game is played with 5 people it will take about 50 minutes so thats about 10 minutes a game. If you are playing alone though you will have to go back to your seat between each frame for these calculations to work.\\n\\nSo that is about 2.2 calories a minute for me, but I am only active one minute of every 5 during my leaague. If my basal metabolic rate is 2400 calories per day, then I will burn an average of 1.6 calories a minute doing nothing. That average is skewed by the digesting of the food, and actually doing nothing in the bowling alley would be more like 1.2 calories per minute. \\n\\nSo when I bowl with my league I am burning 1.2 calories 4 of every 5 minutes and 2.2 calories the fifth minute for 150 minutes. I burn 210 calories while bowling, or an average of 1.4 calories per minute.\\n\\nIf you are there to workout try doing these things to make it a better workout....\\n\\nSit farther from the alley. The seats up behind the setee area where food and drink is served will get you walking farther.\\n\\nIf you don't care as much about the bowling as the workout take the whole 15 foot approach, have a high backswing and release the ball with as much velocity as you can. This will burn more.\\n\\nIf you do care about your bowling then add things like picking the ball up a couple of times, raise it up above your head as part of your "ritual" before you bowl, or take it back to your seat every third frame to clean it. This extra heaving around of the ball will take more energy.\\n\\nYou can also walk down to the other end of the alley when its not your turn to talk with friends there or just check out all the scores and other bowling styles while getting the extra walk. You can even try kegel exercises while in your seat. (yes that was a joke)\\n\\ngood luck bowling off those pounds!

I don't believe that God condones any act of killing another and would not view any war as justified. God in infinite wisdom and compassion however, knows that the human race has a lot to learn and I'm sure will forgive the actions of soldiers in a  war.\\n\\nRather than being concerned about someone "going to Hell" (which I believe takes a lot of hard work to get there), my  biggest concern is for the returning soldiers living in the Hell in their own minds as they remember the horrors they lived through.  Pray that all find peace.
Whit patience.

I think it's a smokescreen. There's a lot of noise being raised about Ms. Clinton, and most of it's coming from the Republicans. I think the plan is to get the recognition factor going, and hope that she gets nominated, because the GOP think they'll have an easy time beating her. If they try that Swift Boat garbage with her, they just might. She's a very polarizing figure, and if you've been on Yahoo Answers awhile, you know that there's people that absolutely despise the Clinton name. As for why Spitzer or Biden isn't mentioned, it's whistling past the graveyard.

I agree with arbiter's approach and, mostly, his answer.  But I'd use an alternator efficiency more like 50% and therefore get about 75 ml/hour of gasoline.  (0.02 US gallons/hour).\\n\\nFor my Prius cruising at 65 mph, getting 48 mpg (1.35 gallons per hour), that would reduce gas mileage by 1.5%.  Or from 48.0 mpg to 47.3 mpg.  Maybe a touch less because the gasoline engine only comes on during more efficient loads (i.e. it never idles or operates at 5%) so it does a bit better than 30% efficiency.  \\n\\nI know a really meticulous German guy who approaches 70 mpg in a diesel VW by using all the tricks - no lights, no fan use, keeping the junk out of the trunk, shutting down as he approaches stops, high-pressure tires, slow starts, etc.  But, man!, it is nerve-racking to drive with someone like that.\\n\\nFor a Hummer getting 14 mpg on the highway (with a tailwind!), it would drop to 13.94 mpg.  Pretty dang hard to notice.\\n\\nOver 100,000 (daytime) miles at an average speed of 30 mph, 0.02 gallons per hour adds up to 67 gallons.  For either car.\\n\\nOf course, one head-on collision by someone who didn't notice your car, and you'd wish you'd spent the $200 on the extra gasoline.\\n\\nInterestingly, if the Hummer averages 12 mpg over 100,000 miles, and gas is $3/gallon, it will cost $25,000 to keep it fueled up.  With which, one could have bought a Prius.  Or two Echos (which would seat 10!).  Hmmmmm.

Roberts is hot right now, so get him while he is still racking up steals. He's on pace for 66, but don't count on that. He's usually good for 30+, though, and I think that's what he'll end up with. Some better long-term solutions that might be available in your league are Felipe Lopez, Chone Figgins and maybe even Ryan Freel. Roberts is halfway to 30 steals already and may only give you 15 more while Figgins and Freel are around 10 steals and should finish with 30+. Lopez is leading the majors, so I doubt he'll be available in your league. But grab Roberts while he's still hot and when he starts to cool down, grab one of these other guys.

Yes, it's true.  Developing dark skin was nature's way of providing more protection from the sun's rays. That's why people tan, it's to help protect the skin. Light skin burns easily. Light eyes are more sensitive to bright light. Have you also noticed that  most black americans are not real dark like true africans? They aren't exposed to that harsh sun anymore and have lightened up. I'm not sure about the hair "curling up from steam" it sounds reasonable, but actually, straight hair when seen under a microscope is round like a pencil, and tight curly hair is flatter like a ruler. Soft curly hair is oval shaped. It's the follicles that determine curly or straight. But hey, it might have originated that way from heat, I don't know.\\nps. I think brown skin and green eyes are gorgeous, and also shiny black hair with ice blue eyes too. It's different.

It does depend a little on how young we are talking about - a 5 year old is not going to understand some of the more sublte triggers and points that perhaps a 14 year old might\\n\\nIf you are a victim to racism, then unless you want the youngster to "be a victim" try and make them realise that there will ALWAYS be people who have a problem with someones colour , religion, gender, sexuality etc and race is no different. Try to make them realise it is nothing to do with them, more a hangup belongin to someone else.\\n\\nIf you hear them making slurs and are racist, then presumably you would be impressed. Sad but there ya go. If you are not overly impressed, then rather than jump down their throats, try to find out what made them make the comments, see if you can get them to explain their attitude. Do they have a reason - is it peer pressure ?\\n\\nIf you don't approve of racism, then above applies really, try and deal with it with them in a realistic and honest way - but do not add your own personal thoughts grudges and hang-ups to the pot if you can help it.\\n\\nIf you are racist, then I guess you will encourage your child to carry on the hate for another generation. Seems a bit of a cruel thing to do but there ya go.\\n\\n\\nps:\\n\\nMizogen, your story about the Jewish father is powerful and I have heard it before. But although very quotable, I think there is a danger f being too cynical in life.\\n\\nI would far rather be taken for a mug once in a blue-moon  - and accept that some folks are decent human beings - than make sure I distrust everyone at all time no matter what.\\n\\nTelling a child he should epxect no good from any man is a pretty good way of crippling his/her social skills from day one. My guess is that if you follow your own advice, you are perhaps someone who "enjoys their own company" a great deal of the time. do you really wish such a friendless, loveless life for your kids too?

I've used Limewire for awhile now, and I'm pretty happy with it.  Ares is kinda slow and it's hard to find rare songs, videos, etc.  I tried Bearshare for a little bit and got the same results.  I'd say stick with Limewire, but make sure you scan every file before you open it.\\n\\n.
Yes they can and yes they suck for doing this, but, that's the sorry state of health care in our country today.\\n\\nCall your doctor, explain the situation, and ask him/her to help you fill out the forms that you can download and print out from the web site for the Partnership for Prescription Assistance. This organization is a godsend. They are a liasion between you, your doctor, and the pharmaceutical company that makes your medication, and, in many cases, can help you get your meds at little to no cost. They helped me get my migraine medication - Imitrex - when my insurance ran out, for free, which saved my life because the doses cost $30 each and it was way out of my league to pay for out of pocket. You have to do the initial legwork on getting the forms, but, your doctor should be able to step up to the plate and help you out while waiting for the approvals, by providing you with samples, which they get for free from pharmaceutical salespeople. My doctor had a drawer full, I kid you not, and was able to give me a few to tide me over. Be assertive, be thorough, be diligent, and don't give up. DO NOT GO BACK ON THE USELESS NARCOTICS. You will only do yourself more harm than good, as you already know. You have to be your own advocate here, as no one in our current government is gonna speak up for you. Don't forget to vote on Tuesday, against every single incumbant who has failed to make affordable health care a reality for us average Americans.
General at service of the emir Abd ar-Rahman II of Córdoba, that was uncle of the emir Al-Hakam I.\\n\\nIn 826 revolted Aissó (or Aysun) and requested help to Abd al-Rahman II. This sent to the general Ubayd Allah known also as Abu Marwan, that it arrived to Zaragoza in May 827. From there it happened to territory of the county of Barcelona, reaching Barcelona in summer, that it was besieged without success, ransacking its surroundings. Then moved to Girona that either they could occupy (October 10, 827). Louis the Pious, while, knowing the Musulman raid, ordered to his son Pippin of Aquitania, and to the counts Hugo of Tours and Matfred of Orleans, the recruitment of an army, but the recruitment was slow and when it was formed already Abu Merwan and its army was returning to its dominances. The rebels abandoned the country with them (827).

Statistics can give you an outline or good idea of what to expect in the future by analyzing past facts and figures in order to render a more educated decision. History does have a way of repeating itself and by looking at statics in a current market trend you can forcast a possible scenario based upon what may have already transpired in a similar situation.

You can only make Vitamin D by sunlight exposure on the skin, so the more skin that's exposed, the more vitamin D you make.  Also, in the summer, the skin is higher in the sky - you can more sunlight concentration on the areas of the skin that is exposed.\\n\\n5 minutes of summer sun in shorts would give you ample Vitamin D. In winter, depending on where you live and on how bright and clear the sunshine is and the amount of skin you have exposed, you might need 20 or 30 minutes a day.
The main key is found in Acts 21:8  --\\n\\n"On the next day we departed and came to Caesarea, and we entered the house of Philip the EVANGELIST, who was one of the SEVEN, and stayed with him."\\n\\nIn the passage you asked about --Acts 8--  we find Philip sent specifically to declare the good news, that is, to act as an evangelist, calling people to faith.  And that is what happens, and people believe and are baptized.\\n\\n---------\\nThe question is --Was he a "DEACON" ?!\\n\\nThis is not quite as clearcut as many think.  In Acts 6 and 21 he is referred to as one of "the seven".  The word "deacon" never appears! \\n\\nThe reason people have taken to calling these men deacons is the WORK they were given to do, and esp. Peter's statement in Acts 6:2 - "It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables." The word "serve" here is diakonia.  But in fact the Greek words used are often very general "diakonia" = "service" and "diakonos" = "servant".  They do NOT always refer to the more specific "office of deacon" that we find later on (in Paul's epistles).\\n\\nIf you look at how "the seven" where chosen in Acts 6, and their subsequent ministry, it is clear they did more than oversee the "ministry of mercy" or finances associated with the special office of deacon in the church.   Rather, these were known leaders of the Greek-speaking (Jewish) Christian community.  So it's not surprising to find Stephen preaching (Acts 7) and Philip evanglizing (Acts 8).  (For that matter, the picture of Acts as a whole seems to be that PAUL takes up the work of Stephen!)\\n\\nIn fact, the Spirit-filled Seven of Acts 6 strongly echoes an Old Testament story (in Numbers 11) of the Seventy ELDERS of Israel who were given the Spirit to help Moses when the people grumbled about the food!   I'm not saying the Seven should be called "elders", just that "deacons" is not necessarily accurate.

There's nothing that can be done to increase your height at 25.  You're well past puberty.  No advertised product will make you grow, unfortunately.\\n\\nThere are surgeries which involve chipping and elongating the bones in your legs.  These are typically excrutiating and the procedures last for years to achieve a result of an inch or two.  This is sometimes performed on people with dwarfism, but I can't imagine many doctors who would be willing to put a patient through that kind of pain if they are already at 5'7" ... which, while not average (which is probably 5'9" or 5'10"), is not abnormally short for a male.  \\n\\nBe happy with yourself.  I recommend trying to achieve those goals just as you are.

Yes, but no one knows where that point is.\\n\\nGovernment debt increases the cost of capital.  Capital is bought and sold like any other commodity.  When you buy capital, the transaction is called a "loan" or "mortgage."  Government debt reduces the supply of capital and thus increases the cost (interest rate) of borrowing money.  This inhibits business by making it harder for businesses and individuals to borrow money.\\n\\nIf government debt becomes too large, business comes to a standstill and the economy would be in danger of collapsing.  No one thinks that the US economy is in danger of standing still or collapsing from government debt.

Time travel is completly possible. \\n\\nwhen Albert Einstein released his theory of special relativity, he laid the foundation for the theoretical possibility of time travel. As we all know, no one has successfully demonstrated time travel, but no one has been able to rule it out either. \\n\\nIf you travel at the speed of light, time stops for you, not for other people. So say you travel at the speed of ligt for a week in space, when you come back to earth youll find that its been maybe 100 years in the future.\\n\\nI also know a russian astronaught (<--- Spelling wrong) that traveled a fraction of a seconed in the future.

I would suggest either of these two products\\nGigi Brazilian Bikini Wax Microwave Kit ($14.95) or\\nSurgi-Cream Bikini & Leg Hair Remover ($5.95).\\n\\nThe website has some other products that would work as well, I just prefer either of the two I mentioned. And they aren't too expensive. You can buy from the website or in local stores like CVS, riteaid, etc.

It is sexual harassment because it is offensive, sexual and made by a teacher regarding a student. The Director should reprimand or warn the teacher that it is inappropriate conduct. At the very least you should have the option of changing teachers or modifying your education plan to minimize interaction with him/her (honestly, someone who would make that comment to a student is very unprofessional and has poor self control, I wouldn't blame you for avoiding him). \\n\\nIf the Director does none of these things--go back when the teacher does or says anything else to make you uncomfortable.  You have a witness and you are documenting it which is very good. You have a right to continue your education in peace and if the Director does nothing, you can make it a legal issue.\\n\\nSexual harassment doesn't require comments be made directly to you. He/she is openly creating a hostile learning environment.
If you want to do this it is for life so you need to totally change your way of eating and exercising. This is not a diet rather than a healthy eating plan for life. So no more talking diet cause it means time limit. You will get the results you are after if you stick to this regime it is up to you. \\n\\nHere are the golden rules: \\nInitially cut down to 1200 calories. \\nExercise 6 times per week for 1 hours a day. Do three weight sessions and three cardio sessions. No gym involved. \\nDon't eat carbs after 4pm, never eat carbs within 2 hours of exercise or within 1 hour of exercise. \\nDrink 3 litres of water per day. You can have a green tea at the end of the day. \\nLimit your fruit in take to 2 pieces per day. \\nNever eat dinner after 6pm.\\nAdopt of low GI eating plan this is sustainable for life!\\nMake low fat dairy choices \\n\\nFollow this menu plan as a suggestion: \\nBreakfast 7am - 1 cup hot water w lemon\\n20 minutes later have a bowel of oats w water (no honey) OR\\nfruit salad w low GI soy yogurt\\nSnack 10am - pear or apple (both low GI)\\nLunch 12.30pm - muligrain sandwich w 50g tuna & salad (no butter)\\nSnack 3pm - low GI yogurt OR skim berry smoothie (no honey or banana) plenty of ice, 1/2 cup skim milk & 1/4 cup yogurt\\nDinner 5.30pm - 120g grilled lean meat/fish/prawns/tofu patties (not fried) w spinach salad & mixed vegies (no whites, carbs) OR 3 egg white/soy omlette with ham, cheese and tomato\\nSnack - 1 scoop of low cal low fat ice cream (if hungry)\\n\\nExercise is must be intense. Refer to www.bodybuilding.com for your weights routine. Never do weights two consecutive days have a cardio day in between. \\n\\nCardio needs to include running, go hard up stair wells and cycling. You get the most benefits from exercise when your body is totally fatigued and this is when you see changes. \\n\\nTo maintain you can increase calories to 1500 and reduce exercise sessions to 3-4 times per week. If weight creeps up again due to holiday period etc.. go back to 1200 cal and 6 sessions again. \\n\\nGood luck it worked for me it can work for anyone.
Good question. It's the sort of thing that seems so obvious -- but everyone has a different opinion about just what the correct answer is. In some parts of the world, sunrise happens when you can distinguish between a black thread and a white one - in other words, when the day begins to become light. In other places it isn't until the sun is actually on the horizon. It's pretty spectacular to watch the sun rise in the Grand Canyon -- it literally runs down the walls of the canyon, revealing things you never see at any other time of day, until it hits the bottom of the canyon. \\nThe actual definition must have to do with daylight, because if it were when we saw the sun on the horizon, that means there would never be a sunrise on a cloudy or rainy day. \\n'But that's just my opinion.

Yes, you can request that a Credit Reporting Agency add a supplement to your credit.  This will not help your score, but it does allow those who run your credit see your explanation for the default.  I am not sure of exactly how each company handles these requests, but if you report it to only one agency, then only one agency is responsible for attaching it to your credit.  They do have to attach the supplement but you may incur a small fee, since it is not a part of your actual report.  When in doubt just give them a call.  Look below for the 3 major CRAs and contact info.

Because they dont have water filters to purify thier water. All thier waste gets dumped into local rivers, streams, or lakes, and without a pump or purification system they are forced to drink the water to survive even though the water is so contaminated with parasites, fungus, and hundreds of diseases. The contaminated water, in most 3rd world countries, also makes it almost impossible to find any food or animals around the water sources. So even if the people didnt drink the water, they would still be influenced due to the food and animals they eat.

Globes are tilted -- the angle is about 23.5 degrees -- because that is the angle between the axis of rotation of the Earth and the normal of the Ecliptic. The Ecliptic is the orbital plane of the Solar System.\\n\\nThe tilt is responsible for the seasons. If the angle was zero degrees, the Sun would always travel the same apparent path through the sky (over the equator, of course) and there would be no seasons. The reason the seasons change is in summer, the pole of the Earth is tilted toward the Sun and more light falls on that hemisphere, warming it up. On the opposite hemisphere, pointed more away from the sun, less light falls and it's colder. Since the tilt of the axis remains more or less constant, the seasons change as the Earth orbits the sun, warming up opposite hemispheres alternately.

climb on top of him and move up and down (which is what most guys perfer) make him grab you hips some time and take control. Don't let him take control the whole time though.

faster than 15 km for sure. i ride with a bike club that rides consistently around 20 miles an hour, and there are many women who ride. i'd definitely imagine a road race for women would be able to consistently hold above 6. whatever miles an hour 15 km/h equals. Me and several friends of mine (including girls) averaged much faster than that on mountain climbs in colorado.\\n\\nas for speeds they can achieve, if its in the mountains, going down it would easily be in excess of 50 miles an hour.

I don't know how old you are, but try to hangout with the guy: maybe work on homework together or invite him and his friends to hang out with you and your friends. Pay attention to him but be cool about it-NO tripping, getting over-excited or stalking or acting obsessed. If he gets the clue and tells you he likes you-mission accomplished! If he seems interested but you get the feeling he is too shy to admit he likes you then just casually ask him to hangout, just the two of you this time. If he doesn't seem interested play it cool and let it slide, you don't want to lose a friend and besides there are plenty of guys out there who would like a thoughtful girl like you. Good luck!!!

Yes. However it depends on what you hit at the bottom. If your head hits a rock, definitely. True story: A man parachuted from 5000 feet and his chutes didn't open. He landed feet first (must have been a really soft surface) and walked away. The only difference was that he was an inch and a half shorter.  So you just never know, but a fifty foot fall could kill you depending upon what you land on and how you land.

i would advise you go back to the person who did your piercing, but since they did your initial piercing with sterling silver, then they are no good!  they should have done your initial piercing with stainless surgical steel...please find a reputable piercer in your area that uses stainless surgical steel for your initial piercing.\\nin the meantime if you want to save your piercing, go find a surgical steel nose ring asap to put in from a more reputable piercing place!  a good piercing place will help you with your problem.  if not, then you will have to wait until it heals and closes up and try again through a reputable piercer.  \\n\\nto heal/clear up the infection, try sea salt soaks (a pinch of sea salt in 3 oz of hot tap water, soak a cotton ball and put it over your piercing for 5 minutes). it worked for me!

Your question suggests you want an answer that only involves 2 dimensions. This is not possible. If you arrange the sticks in a star shape as has been suggested then once two sticks touch you cannot get any more across the boundary they create. If you are allowed into the 3rd dimension slightly then you can arrange the sticks as follows. Arrange two sticks in a V shape. Insert another stick into the V so it touches the other two sticks but doesn't push them apart. I don't have a character on my keyboard to illustrate but the result will look like the three fingers remaining if you folded your thumb and little finger down. Now do the same but laying the remaining three sticks on top on the three you just put down and making sure the neck of the second V is rotated by 90 degrees with respect to the first.

I pulled my back years ago and have recurrent back aches, so I empathize with you.  Its hard to stand when you're sitting, hard to sit when you're standing, hard to walk, hard to turn to look back, etc. etc.  First of all, you should see a doctor to rule out a slipped disk, ligament tear, etc..   Second, and until you can get attention, the best help for back pain is to stay off the back, and that means lying down flat on your back on a firm mat/mattress (not hard floor or soft couch or mattress).  Don't put a pillow under your head.  Tent your legs at the knee and stay that way, for as long as you can. That is the best.  You may want to take an analagesic or something, and if you have a heating pad, heat helps reduce the muscle spasm.  I use a muscle relaxant tablets and an anti-inflamatory cream, heat and stay off my back at every opportunity till it eases.  Don't exercise and try pulling your knees up to your chest until the acute phase of the spasm has eased or you ease pulling the muscle and have years of pain.  Also, if you have to sit, be sure it is a firm chair, don't slouch and try to keep your back perpendicular to your lap.  Hope the pain eases soon for you
I would say the obligations of a guardian are the same as a parent.  Safeguard the child and provide for their basic needs.  I'd imagine that temporary guardians are possible, if say, a single parent is put in jail for something like tax evasion for a couple months.  A temporary guardian, probably someone in the immediate family, would be named guardian for that time.

Nice question. I just answered the Girl Scout cookie question, so my mind naturally was on my elementary school years...and what flashed by immediately was being in a warm, cozy house with a fire burning in the fireplace, my Mom cooking dinner, the table set with glowing candles, fresh chrysanthemums arranged in the entry hall, and curled up snugly under my Grandmother's hand-sewn quilt, reading one of my favorite childhood books, like The Bobbsey Twins, or Nancy Drew. The memory is a trigger of joy to me, and I thank you for such a special question.

Here are some basics:\\n\\nS-Corp: limits personal liability of owners to investment in the business; LLC: ditto\\n\\nS-Corp: avoids "double taxation" of ordinary corporations.  (Standard corporations pay income tax, then distribute profits to owners, who pay tax again on the income.)  S-Corps pass profits to owners, who pay tax on the income, but the corporation itself only files a return and doesn't pay income tax.  LLC: can basically decide whether to be taxed like a corporation, like a simple partnership, or like a sole proprietorship.  The default rule depends on how many owners the LLC has, but you can file a form with the IRS to tell it you want a different option.\\n\\nS-Corp: ownership limited in number and restricted to natural persons (not other corporations) and legal residents; LLC: ownership not limited by number or citizenship/residency status\\n\\nYou might find it easier to complete the paperwork for an LLC, though both are well-designed for small businesses.\\n\\nIf you go with an S-Corp, be sure to check with your state to see whether they require you to file for S-Corp status with them, too.  I've had clients who filed S-Corp status with the IRS but not the state, then the state turns up in a few years wanting corporate income tax because the company was not an S-Corp in the state's eyes, just a regular, income-tax owing corporation.  It is a very good idea to consult with a locally licensed attorney on this decision, though you may be able to handle the actual set-up yourself.\\n\\nI hope that helps.  Good luck.

Well, it could be a number of things.  He could be the type of person who wants to keep relationships separate from his friends and family, or it may be a sign that this may not be the relationship that you'd like it to be.  Does he have the means (i.e. does he have a job, money, transportation, etc.) to be able to take you out?  Did he take his previous women out on dates before you?  Are you his first relationship?  He may just be inexperienced in dating and not think to introduce you to his family nor to take you anywhere.  Is it a cultural thing?  Maybe he's from a culture where traditions are different and you don't meet friends and family until it is more serious.\\n\\nUnfortuantely, I'm not getting a good feeling about your guy.  I've seen other relationships where the person didn't take his woman out on dates and avoided mixing her in with friends and family so that he could say, down the road, that what they had wasn't a relationship.  I can't say for sure that this would happen to you (because I don't know you or him), but I would look at this as something to be concerned about.  If you really want to be with him, you may have to overlook these things about him and find other things to focus on in the relationship.

umm... i'm in physics right now also, trying to think of a great summer assignment for the class.  i would suggest something like rockets (7th and 8th graders always love rockets), or a trebuchet (catapult).  those are always fun to make, and everybody loves those projects.  so, have fun!
Depending on the nature of the business, the entire advantage likely lies in the information the business has.  Information about the product, information about the industry, information about the customer.\\n\\nInformation really is what determines the success or failure of a company.  With that, it's clear why the information needs to be protected. As it is currently there is no "perfect" protection.  All two-way encryption methods can be deciphered, however some much more easily than others.\\n\\nBottom line, the better the encryption, the less likely you are to have your information discovered and (in the worst case) used against you.

First of all, he was signed to a free-agent deal; he wasn't traded. Second, being a huge Cowboy fan, I think that signing him was a good idea. Andy Reid is too soft to handle players like Owens. Look at Keyshawn Johnson. When he left the NY Jets and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he left on bad notes. When he came to the Cowboys, he uttered little word under the direction of the drill sergeant of the NFL, Bill Parcells. Parcells knows how to control outspoken players like Johnson and Owens. Just wait until football season starts.

I'm not so sure that I will agree with you on the issue! you know as for everything maturity is the key, when we are young you go to church because our parents take us there, we don't choose our religion we follow our parents. I believe that the religion does not save, your faith does, however being surrounded by true believer make the path of spirituality much easier. My opinion and advice to you would be to keep learning about GOD words, read your Bible as often as possible get explanations on point that you do not understand clearly, and don't get involve in any debate yet give yourself a couple of more years to be ready to do so.... I'm not saying to hide that you love GOD, I'm saying not to debate on religion or faith for now.

Wow. A lot of people on this thread haven't really read their Bible. \\n\\nYes, everybody has read Paul's letter to the Corinthians that states that women should not teach men. Yet, Paul is very inconsistent in his writings on the subject of whether women should hold positions of authority in the church. \\n\\nAfter all, in his letter to the Romans, why does Paul make Phoebe the deaconess to the Romans? In his letter to Timothy, Paul makes clear that there are only two church offices: Deacon and Bishop. Yet he tells the Romans that he is sending Phoebe as their Deacon (And, yes, he uses the word DEACONESS in Greek...there's no wiggle room on this) and to do what she requires of them. Now if women are not to teach and not to have authority, will somebody explain to me why he's sending a woman to preside over the Romans' church? And, in the same passage, he mentions several other women who have been named to high church office. \\n\\nFurther, as supporting text, all you have to do is read Paul's letter to the Galatians, where he clearly states that there are no men and women in Christ, no rich and poor, no slave and free. There are just Christians. So with Paul clearly subscribing to absolute egalitarianism in the church, why provide one gender with more priveleges than another?\\n\\nSo, no, women cannot be priests in the Catholic Church. But that doesn't mean that the scriptural teachings on the subject are consistent.

Presuming a player is currently under contract to a club, that club have the right to enforce that contract for it's duration.\\n\\nShould another club want that player they can offer to buy him from his current club - this offer will normally take the form of a cash bid, but the exact nature of it is entirely up to the clubs concerned. The club can then decide to accept or reject that bid.\\n\\nShould they accept the bid and decide they want to sell the player, it is then up to the player what they want to do. As they have a contract with the club, they can decide to stay where they are, or they can decide to move.\\n\\nThe top players can attract bids huge bids from other teams, but the counter side is that when a player is out of contract they are free to sign a new contract with any club they like.\\n\\nFor this reason most clubs try to prevent their players reaching the last year or 2 of their contract, and if a player won't sign a new one by this stage they will seek to sell him to another club while they still have some value left.\\n\\nThis is just an overview, and many more complex rules exist particularly in relation to younger players, and when transfers can actually take place.

10% *safe* investments don't exist! In general the more risk you take the better the performance *might* be.\\n\\nThat said the best you can do is a mix. \\nSuppose you have 1000 dollars. \\nPut 800 into CDs. One can get about 4%/year on those. So in five years the 800 dollars will grow to 1000 dollars. This guarantees your capital.\\nPut the other 200 dollars into a stock index fund, or better buy an index tracker. After five years this investment will have made *on average*  7%/year. It could be much less, or much more, this is the joker part of your investment. In practice you will have something between 150 and 350 dollars.\\n\\nSo after five years the 1000 dollar will have grown into something between 1150 and 1350 dollars.   \\n\\nIf you want more risk, change the 80-20 mix to 60-40 or 50-50.\\nYour capital is no longer guaranteed, but your chances to gain more increase.

They are actually Jor-El's underwear, which Superman wears to honor his late father & the entire Kryptonian race.  However, since no one wants to wear the same underwear that covered the junk that helped to conceive him, & have it pressed against his own junk, especially since his father's junk also touched his mother's junk, Superman decided to wear these outside his tights.  That way, he could honor his father, but not feel all dirty about it.\\nIn an ironic twist of fate, Superman saved a young girl during the 70s.  She, too, wondered about the underwear outside the clothes.  She also thought that was a very bold & inspiring fashion statement.  Therefore, she also decided when she got older, she would occasionally wear her underwear on the outside of her clothes to honor the Man of Steel who saved her life, on those rare occasions when she would wear any underwear.  Today, we know this woman as Madonna.

well i just got over cholesterol problems myself.  my bads were really high and my goods where really low. all i did was cut grease out of my diet (use olive oil very good) i started eating oatmeal in mornings (oatmeal eats bad cholesterol's) I started eating more salads and a lot less beef. focused most of my meals on chicken and some pork. so no more hamburger helper. when i went back in for blood work six months later the goods and bads had pretty much leveled off plus i lost 10 pounds.  My doctor was pretty impressed because she prescribed me some pills TRICOR or something but it gave me diarrhea  so i stopped those with in a week of getting them. also you can go to an organic store and get Fish oil pills and garlic pills THESE WORK GREAT if you like taking pills. i hope this helps you

Economic history of Nicaragua \\n\\nPre-Columbian and Colonial Era\\nThe first Spanish explorers of Nicaragua found a welldeveloped agrarian society in the central highlands and Pacific lowlands. The rich volcanic soils produced a wide array of products, including beans, peppers, corn, cocoa, and cassava (manioc). Agricultural land was held communally, and each community had a central marketplace for trading and distributing food.\\n\\nThe arrival of the Spanish in the early 1500s destroyed, for all intents and purposes, the indigenous agricultural system. The early conquistadors were interested primarily in gold; European diseases and forced work in the gold mines decimated the native population. Some small areas continued to be cultivated at the end of the 1500s, but most previously tilled land reverted to jungle. By the early 1600s, cattle raising, along with small areas of corn and cocoa cultivation and forestry, had become the primary function of Nicaragua's land. Beef, hides, and tallow were the colony's principal exports for the next two and a half centuries.\\n\\n\\nThe Coffee Boom, 1840s-1940s\\nCoffee was the product that would change Nicaragua's economy. Coffee was first grown domestically as a curiosity in the early 1800s. In the late 1840s, however, as coffee's popularity grew in North America and Europe, commercial coffee growing began in the area around Managua. By the early 1850s, passengers crossing Nicaragua en route to California were served large quantities of Nicaraguan coffee. The Central American coffee boom was in full swing in Nicaragua by the 1870s, and large areas in western Nicaragua were cleared and planted with coffee trees.\\n\\nUnlike traditional cattle raising or subsistence farming, coffee production required significant capital and large pools of labor. Laws were therefore passed to encourage foreign investment and allow easy acquisition of land. The Subsidy Laws of 1879 and 1889 gave planters with large holdings a subsidy of US$0.05 per tree.\\n\\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, the entire economy came to resemble what is often referred to as a "banana republic" economy--one controlled by foreign interests and a small domestic elite oriented toward the production of a single agriculture export. Profits from coffee production flowed abroad or to the small number of landowners. Taxes on coffee were virtually nonexistent. The economy was also hostage to fluctuations in the price of coffee on the world markets--wide swings in coffee prices meant boom or bust years in Nicaragua.\\n\\n\\nDiversification and Growth, 1945-77\\nThe period after World War II was a time of economic diversification. The government brought in foreign technocrats to give advice on increasing production of new crops; hectarage in bananas and sugarcane increased, livestock herds grew, and cotton became a new export crop. The demand for cotton during the Korean War (1950-53) caused a rapid increase in cotton production, and by the mid-1950s, cotton was the nation's second largest export earner, after coffee.\\n\\nEconomic growth continued in the 1960s, largely as a result of industrialization. Under the stimulus of the newly formed Central American Common Market, Nicaragua achieved a certain degree of specialization in processed foods, chemicals, and metal manufacturing. By the end of the 1960s, however, import-substitution industrialization as a stimulus for economic growth had been exhausted. The 1969 Soccer War between Honduras and El Salvador, two members of the CACM, effectively suspended attempts at regional integration until 1987, when the Esquipulas II agreement was signed. By 1970 the industrial sector was undergoing little additional import substitution, and the collapse of the CACM meant that Nicaragua's economic growth, which had come from the expanding manufacturing sector, halted. Furthermore, the manufacturing firms that had developed under the tariff protection of the CACM were generally

If you insist, I will answer. I will give now a short answer , but later on I want to give a real long answer. I have final exams; therefore, I have hurry. Remind me , again!\\nAnyway, first of all I wonna know the exact part of Quran from which this muslim has quoted these words. I didn't memorized the whole book . And I want to read this part , again because I want to read the whole paragraph. \\nHere is my answer. You are right. God is omniscient and not only omniscient. Time has no meaning for him. He is not time dependent. There is no before or after for him. So, we cant talk about "He made a mistake (past) but will(future) not do again." . Quran speaks clearly about the perfection of Quran and its invulnurability. You know my answer about the bible's corruption . So, there is no god's mistake , ther is only choice, order and creation of the god, which is mistakeless. What happened to bible was not a mistake, but may be a sign of it completed its duty and an other one will come. The deaths of the prophets was the same thing, their duty was over. They completed it. So, there is no mistake about it. This person has given to you a wrong answer or couldn't explain his thought clearly and made a mistake. \\nBesides that! These two sentences from Quran (but I want to see the whole paragraph, I hope they are really quotes.) means that: \\nSecond one (you will never do it) is pretty clear. \\nFirst one (you wouldn't be able to do it) is telling about the mistake of people. It is a sentece like : If you are really true believers, you wouldn't be able to do it" because true believers respect the God and this respect contains also a fear! Fear of doing such a great mistakes which will corrupt the book of god. People who corrupted the bible and old tastament will pay for it! They were just liers , who seemed some times as good people or real priests or what ever. This is underlined with these words of Quran. I am not adding to these group every one. There were great christian saints even after corruption. God bless them! But esspecially in the times of old testament , man of religion changed it a lot for their own good and won more power over people! I think that is enough for now! Funny thing is this sentence doesn't mean your comment. Your answer is manipulating the meaning. OK, may be you really understand it  that way and that's why you asked it. I hope it was a misunderstanding  or questioning not a manipulation. \\nBye for now!\\n\\nWhen you can find me the correct numbers of the quote, I will read the whole paragraph. I also will try to find it. It is my responsibility and I will keep it!

Most police agencies have a system for purchasing their police cruisers.  Some buy every year, some every couple of years, but most buy a certain number each year to replace the ones currently in use.  The attrition of some cars are due to accidents, but most are due to the wear and tear on those cars.  You figure they are well maintained, but the starting and stopping, high speeds, and being run nearly constantly during the shifts, it takes it's toll.  \\n\\n20,000 miles on a police car is like nearly 100,000 to ours.\\n\\nAs for money, each municipality sets aside a fixed amount for it's law enforcement detatchments.  Police, jails, etc.  Each department is responsible for allocating the amounts in their respective accounts.  Salaries, equipment, cars, etc.  Check with the city clerk or city manager for the exact percentages of both the budget and the budgeted amounts for vehicle expendatures.
The difference is in the way they transfer ink onto paper.\\n1. Dot matrix:\\nThese are an older generation of printers and function in a way similar to a manual typewriter. The printer has a head with many fine pins and these can be arranged to form characters. The head then strikes an inked ribbon onto the print media.\\n2. Inkjet:\\nThese are quite common now. They are cheaper than lasers but the running costs are higher. They use liquid ink stored in cartridges or ink tanks. Through digital and electronic means, ink is squirted onto the paper by the printer head.\\n3. Laser:\\nA laser printer uses ink in powdered form, usually stored in a toner cartridge. The printer heats/magnetizes the media areas that need to be printed and then the toner powder is attached to the paper.
A paleontologist is one who studies paleontology. Paleontology or palaeontology is the study of the developing history of life on Earth, of ancient plants and animals based on the fossil record, evidence of their existence preserved in rocks. This includes the study of body fossils, tracks, burrows, cast off parts, fossilized feces ("coprolites"), and chemical residues.
No, the 16th Amendment says, "The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration." If the 4th amendment would have applied before that amendment was passed (which I doubt), passing the 16th completely empowered Congress to tax incomes, regardless of all previous amendments.\\n\\nAlso, about the "missing" 13th ammendment, it regards titles of nobility, not lawyers.

Mexico does always seem to want us to fix its problems. Mexico can have boders and  control its borders. Mexico can enforce its immigration laws. Mexico sends its poor to the U S A, even putting out a book on how it get across our border. Mexico illegals in the U S A send money back to Mexico, and Mexico is very happy to take it. Mexico tells us if we can put up a fence or not. Mexico tells us that they are a poor country, but they are the richest Latin American country, and are the 13 th richest world wide. Yes it sure does seem they want everything their way.
The above answer is correct with respect to human anatomy. However, the shoulder girdle of most vertebrates has more bones. \\nIn most vertebrates, there is one important bone dorsal to the glenoid cavity (the place where the humerus articulates), that's the scapula. \\nThere's another important bone ventral to the glenoid cavity, the coracoid. \\nFor instance, in an amphibian there are well developed scapulae (with a suprascapular cartilage) and coracoids; and claviculae (ventral, situated anterior to the coracoids). The claviculae and the coracoid connect the shoulder girdle with the sternum.\\nReptiles have many variations including other bones (interclavicula, etc.)\\nBirds have strong scapulae and coracoids, and the claviculae fused in a furcula.\\nPrototherian mammals (platypus and echidnas) have a reptilian-like shoulder girdle; marsupials and eutherians only have scapula, because the coracoid has fused to it forming the "coracoid apophysis". The clavicle may be present or absent; it's usually well developed in animals that use their forelimbs for different movements (for instance climbing, manipulating food) and reduced or absent in others that are specialized for running.

Actually lynching does not necessarily to have anything to do with hanging someone.  A lynching is violence committed by a group of people.  In SC law, 1st degree lynching is a death causing by an act of violence by a mob.  2nd degree lynching is an act of violence by a mob which does not result in death.  A mob is defined in the statute as two or more people.  1st degree lynching can result in imprisonment from five to forty years.  2nd degree lynching can result in imprisonment from three years to twenty years.  Of course, the definitions and penalties for lynching will vary from state to state.

This again depends on the coin itself for starters. Most jewelers or pawn shops will not buy something like that at the cost of gold as they would have to refine it, which costs money and/or time.... Maybe you could get 60% od spot price of total weight of gold, now remember that the kt also plays a factor.... such as 14kt gold is only just over half percent pure gold....if you have a half ounce and its 14kt, with gold at $700 per oz figure 60% of $350 if you are lucky and find the right place. You may wish to try a coin shop as the coin itself may have its own value beyond the gold... Good Luck

Depends on what your goal is and what your position is. A masters degree is usually a good way to get an entry level management position. Once you have a position that you like, it may have less utility to you. Therefore a certificate program that has specific skills that you want to use in your job might be more useful to you. Certificate programs are a lot shorter. One advantage of some certificate programs is that you can start out in the certificate program and then apply the credits toward a masters degree if you decide to go that route.\\n\\nIf you want to advance to a new job or a higher management position, what kind of educational background do the persons who are in those jobs now have?

Ok, first things first, what you did was VERY unwise. You borrowed money for your cousin and made no legal requirement on him to pay anything. The only thing you can do without getting sued is to make payments to the bank and makeup the past due balance. Hopefully you will learn from this experience.\\n\\nYou have a loan with the bank that you applied for and signed a contract with. The bank is not required to verify that you have a license to give you a loan. There is no requirement about where the documents can be signed.\\n\\nYou could possibly sue your cousin, however since you don't have any written contract with him, it will be difficult.

A glide bomb is an aerial bomb that is modified with aerodynamic surfaces to modify its flight path from a purely ballistic one, to a flatter, gliding, one. This extends the range between the launch aircraft and the target. Glide bombs are often fitted with control systems, allowing the controlling aircraft to direct the bomb to a pinpoint target.\\n\\nThe first glide bombs were developed by the Germans during World War II as an anti-shipping weapon. Ships are typically very difficult to attack: a direct hit is needed to do any serious damage, and hitting a target as small as a ship was difficult during WWII. The US felt the solution was massive fleets of bombers dropping a huge numbers of bombs, leading to the development of the B-17, but the Germans instead concentrated on making the bombing itself much more accurate. At first they used dive bombers with some success in this role, but their successes were countered by ever increasing anti-aircraft defenses placed on the Royal Navy ships they were attacking. By 1941 such attacks were still just as difficult as ever, but the added defenses made such attacks almost suicidal as well.\\n\\nThe German solution was the development of a number of radio controlled glide bombs. These were constructed by fitting a control package on the rear of an otherwise standard bomb, starting with their 100kg armor-piercing bomb to create the Ruhrstahl SD 1400, commonly referred to as the Fritz-X. The bomb aimer dropped the bomb while the aircraft was still approaching the ship, and guided it into an impact with the target by sending commands to spoilers attached to the rear of the bomb. This proved to be difficult to do, because as the bomb dropped toward the target it fell further behind the launch aircraft, eventually becoming difficult to see. In addition it proved difficult to properly guide the bomb to impact as the angle of descent changed, and if the bombadier didn't "get it right" and end up with the bomb roughly right over the target, there was little they could do at late stages to fix the problem.\\n\\nNevertheless the Fritz X proved useful once crews were trained on its use. In test drops from 8000m, experienced bomb aimers could place half the bombs within a 15m radius and 90% within 30m. Following the capitulation of Italy in 1943, Germany damaged the Italian battleship Italia and sank the Roma with Fritz X bombs. Attacks were also made on the USS Savannah, causing heavy damage, and on several transports off Anzio. HMS Warspite was also hit, had to be towed to Malta and was out of action for six months. Fritz X attacks also damaged the cruiser USS Philadelphia and sank the British light cruiser Spartan.\\n\\nA more useful weapon was the Henschel Hs 293, which fitted a set of small wings to the guidance system to flatten the trajectory and make the system easier to guide. On release a small liquid fueled rocket fired to speed up the weapon and get it out in front of the bomber, which was aimed to approach the target just off to one side. The bomb then dropped close to the water and glided in parallel to the launch aircraft, with the bomb aimer adjusting the flight left or right. As long as the bomb was dropped at roughly the right range so it didn't run out of altitude while gliding in, the system was easy to use.\\n\\nDesign work started as early as 1939, and a version of the guidance package mounted to standard 500kg bombs was tested in September 1940. It was found that the bomb was unable to penetrate a ships armor, so changes were made to fit an armor-piercing warhead before the system finally entered service in 1943. The basic A-1 model was the only one to be produced in any number, but developments included the B model with a custom armor-piercing warhead, and the C model with the conical warhead that was designed to hit the water short of the ship and then travel a short distance underwater to hit the ship under the waterline.\\n\\nThe Hs 293 was first used operationally
It is obtained by reduction of glucose changing the aldehyde group to an additional hydroxyl group hence the name sugar alcohol.

Domestic Violence charges do not just go away like they use to. Even though they can be dropped later by the state the arrested person still will have a criminal history that will show one charge and no conviction. The DA may decide to drop the charges when you go in front of a judge if there is a bad witness or no witness willing to testify. A wife can not be compelled to testify against her husband just because the state decides to prosecute. The spouse needs to contact the agency that is handling the case and the DA or prosecutor that is handling it for the state and I am sure something can be worked out mutually. Domestic violence is frowned upon now and carries stiff sentences so try and avoid domestic violence at all costs.

when you say 10000 a time, do you mean actual gains?  what i mean is to calculate your gain, you subtract your basis(what you purchased it for) from your sales price (what you sold it for).  If that is amounting to 10000 a time, then yes - you have to pay capital gains on that.  \\n\\nhow do you reduce?  well, if you have other investments that are not doing so well, and you think they wont ever do well, sell them at a loss.  this will reduce your capital gains.  this includes any capital assets you have - real estate, investments, etc, etc.  other than that, there really is no way you can avoid taxes because you already sold them for a gain.  in the future, what i would recommend is at least holding the investments for over a year to ensure long term capital gains rates.

R.S.V.P. stands for a French phrase, "répondez, s'il vous plaît," which means "please reply." The person sending the invitation would like you to tell him or her whether you accept or decline the invitation. That is, will you be coming to the event or not? Etiquette rules followed in most Western cultures require that if you receive a formal, written invitation, you should reply promptly, perhaps that same day. For hosts who are planning a dinner party, a wedding or a reception, this is important from a practical point of view, because they need to know how many people to count on and how much food and drink to buy. More important, though, is the simple courtesy of responding to someone who was nice enough to invite you, even if it is to say that you regret that you will not be able to attend
when a cut is fresh it usually does turn white after you take a shower. so its not infected and when you get a carpet burn the scar is sometimes dotted because my carpet burns scar is dotted as well. i was sliding on the carpet floor somewhere. and well yea.so its dotted in a streak manner. but thats my answer.
I think that the problem a lot of people have with Christianity is that a large segment of Christians try to translate the Bible literally.  This only leads to kind of a joking atmosphere when discussing certain aspects of Christianity and makes it very hard to take the good parts as, well, good parts.  Since some of these people, who believe so completely that the literal translations are the correction translations, feel compelled to constantly, repeatedly and forcefully enlighten others as to their beliefs, it burns bridges for everyone who falls under the banner of Christianity.  Consequently, those who see the teachings of the Bible as simple lessons of morals are not able to spread that understanding because most listeners have become cynical whenever they are preached at.  It is a shame that all that people hear and see is the inherent holes yelled at them by sidewalk prophets and not the plain belief that the Bible is a list of good ideas set to a classic storied theme.  So, just try to take the Bible as a good story with some ideas and morals to try to live by.  Anything more and you will become disenfranchised when something is proven to be incorrect or unbelievable.

My boyfriend say the 6800 GT is a better video card.  It has 16 pixel processors and 6 vortex processors while the GS only has 12 pixel processors and 5 vortex processors. Both cards have 256 bit bus-width, 256 GDDR3 memory, and 1000 Mhz Ram speed. However, the GS has a GPU speed of 425 mHz while the GT has a GPU speed of 350 mHz.  Either card will produce great results.

I prefer a staff.  I'm too clumsy for a lightsaber...I'd just end up hurting myself.  A wand is extremely tempermental, if not handled correctly, and I suspect I'd blow things up a lot more often than not.  A staff, on the other hand, has three things going for it:\\n\\n1. It looks cool, in a "don't mess with me, I'm a mountain man" kind of way.\\n2. It can be used to beat people without killing them, even aside from its magical content.\\n3. Finally, the word "Staff" sounds way cooler and tougher than "wand" (which sounds like something a magical fairy would carry) and "light saber" (which sounds a little too much like the fruity, ring-shaped pocket candy).

Common Sense! It's hard to live in a world with so many idiots.
I think interracial relationships of any kind are perfectly normal. Why can't you like/love another person if they are not the same gender or race as you? These aren't the old days anymore and with the children coming up today, they are being exposed to more at a younger age (Depending where in the country you live). Here in Providence, RI you see interracial couples ALOT! Asian and black, Asian and White, Black and White, Spanish/Latin and White, Spanish/Latin and Asian, Spanish/Latin and Black, etc. It's so common here, what is there to say about it?! It's beautiful! And there is nothing more awesome than a world with love and peace!!! So accept love in whatever color it comes in. You never know, you may be into something GOOD. And I know this because I have experienced love from a different race. And if your in doubt of what others may think about it, think to yourself. If your were madly in love with a girl/boy from a different gender/race, would you let people pull the two of you down? Hopefully not... ... ...~Kay

Yes, completely normal! Obviously we're not talking corkscrews here but a little curvature is perfectly normal. And I shouldn't think women would bother about it - I certainly wouldn't - I think personality and humour are more important. Anyway, presumably someone that's seeing it already likes you quite a lot anyway. lol. Seriously, don't worry - my boyfriend's goes slightly to one side (although I won't tell him I wrote that down). There have been some interesting studies done in which researchers morphed faces to be more or less symmetrical. The findings were that we like things more or less symmetrical - but not completely - subjects described feeling uneasy when looking at faces that were completely symmetrical. A little asymmetry apparently puts the mind at rest. Maybe it makes us more trustworthy and more approachable?

Just like any other business, hospitals need to market themselves. they all have websites, brochures, and advertising. Most likly the marketing center you are questioning is simply a marketing department, and thay are just trying to sound more sophisticated.\\n\\nIt is also possible that they have a big meeting room or media center wher they put on seminars or workshops. This tool is a marketing strategy. It brings people into the hospital. If they have a really excellent area for this, they may even let the community use it for non hospital business, again, it is just to bring more people into the hospital.\\n\\nBringing people in for any reason helps the comfort level and familiarity with the building, the parking and the ammenities. This will make many people more confidant and comfortable in choosing that hospital when they have a medical need.

here are some of my favorites:\\nTwo blondes sit on a park bench at night. One looks up and says, "What's closer, the Moon or Florida?" The other one looks over and says, "Duh, can you see Florida?" \\n\\nA blonde is jogging down the road and sees another blonde in a rowboat in the middle of a field.  The blonde on the road shakes her head and sighs.  "It's blondes like THAT that give us SMART blondes bad names.  If I could swim," she said, "I would go out and help her."\\n\\nA blonde walks into a beauty shop with a pair of headphones on. She asks for a haircut. The blonde is led to a chair and asked to sit down. The woman who is about to cut the blonde's hair asks her to take the headphones off. The blonde does, and a few minutes later she passes out. The surprised shop worker picks up the headphones and hears a little voice saying, "Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out...". \\n4,000 blondes pack the auditorium for the first annual Blondes Are Smart competition. A blonde is chosen from the audience to come on stage and answer a question to prove that blondes aren't dumb. The emcee asks "What is 2 plus 2?" The blonde thinks for a moment and answers "Seven." The emcee shakes his head and the audience begins chanting "Give her another chance! Give her another chance!" The emcee asks again, "What is 2 plus 2?" The blonde concentrates for five minutes and finally answers "Five." The emcee shakes his head and the audience begins chanting "Give her another chance! Give her another chance!" The emcee asks once again "What is 2 + 2?" The blonde screws up her face in thought, scratches her head, and finally answers "Four?" The audience begins chanting "Give her another chance..." \\n\\n\\nTwo blondes are walking in a forest, they spot a pair of tracks. One suggests they're bear tracks, while the other says that they a fox tracks. Then they get hit by a train. \\n\\nQ: How do you make a blonde laugh on Monday morning? \\nA: Tell her a joke on Friday night. \\n\\nQ: If you drop a blonde and a brunette from 100 ft, which hits the ground first? \\nA: The brunette, because the blonde has to ask directions on the way down. \\n\\nEnjoy!

I wasn't able to find a specific site with much more than few sentences about him\\n\\nCharles Thilorier was a scientist who gave the earliest description of solid carbon dioxide. In 1834 he opened a pressurized container of liquid carbon dioxide, only to find that the cooling produced by the rapid evaporation of the liquid yielded a "snow" of solid CO2.\\n\\nDry Ice is the trademark for carbon dioxide in its solid form, frozen at -109.3° F or -79.5° C. It is primarily used as a refrigerant. Dry Ice does not melt but goes directly from a solid to a gas in a process called sublimation. It is generally accepted that French chemist, Charles Thilorier, was the first to record the appearance of it in 1835. The Dry Ice Corporation of America first trademarked the name Dry Ice in 1925

Statistically, more men are hit by lighting, (only a percentage of whom die as a result, by the way), because men are more likely to hold jobs that are outdoor based, and are more likely to engage in outdoor activities.  Simply a sampling error based on who is available for the lightning to strike.

Choose something that interests you. You're more likely to do better research and not get bored with it, than if you randomly pick something only to find part way into it that you couldn't be less interested in that topic. Make it somewhat fun...no reason you can't learn about something you are curious about, while also getting your paper done.
I'm not exactly a scholar of Arkansas state law, put a prenup is, first, a contract.  So it has to have all the same things a contract does.  The parties have to understand it, agree to it, and each give up something of value.  All of its terms have to be written down and it has to be sufficiently detailed so that it's not an "agreement to agree."\\n\\nPrenups are frequently signed between people of unequal power - one wealthy, one less so.  For that reason, most states will insist that the parties be given some extra rights.  Each must have access to an attorney, ample time to consider the prenup, and must have received fairly complete disclosure about the finances of the other.  One or more of these may be waived but the more unequal the position of the parties, the less likely courts will be to allow such waivers. \\n\\nSome states also require prenups to be sworn and notarized, a requirement not necessary for your average contract.\\n\\nAnd couples will have a hard time making an agreement about child support and visitation.  These issues are almost always open for the courts to re-decide them.
Can you offer additional information?  I couldn't find a reference to this case with what you have supplied.
Yes, "I love you". Are there any other options?\\n\\nPerhaps you're trying to ask something about Jewish languages, such as Hebrew, or Yiddish?
If your wife wants you to spend all of your time with her, any kind of relationship, platonic or not, will affect the marriage.\\n\\nBy the way, platonic relationships are usually called friendships - I presume that this is what you meant, a buddy, female by your "extramarital" reference, to share interests with. Nothing wrong with it - most couples have at least some outside interests that are not shared, and spend time away from each other experiencing them with others (poker night and football games for example).\\n\\nHowever, it sounds like the differing interests are only a part of the problem... you listed a whole lot of other ones... but there must be something good if you stuck around for 22 years (power to you, by the way, you are beating averages hands down).\\n\\nWhen was the last time you two talked? Really talked - have you ever told her how you feel about the time spent together, sex life and else, in a way you would talk to a cherished friend, not someone you have to live with because you married them? Was she always like that? If not, where did the girl you fell in love with go, and why; and more importantly, can you two bring her back?\\n\\nI'd suggest to do some maintenance couples counseling, as a safe space to air out all the problems. If you just grow more apart, it's likely that your wife would sense this as a rejection - I can imagine this making her behave even more in the way you dislike, as she tries to fix or control the situation in the only way she knows.\\n\\nPeople in long term relationships sometimes stop communicating and start taking each other for granted. It's easy to get into set habits, and to reinforce each other weaknesses as well as the strengths (was married for 11 years, now divorced- that's part of what happened).\\n\\nFor example, the more independent "caretaker/protector" party can match with the more "clinging/dependent" one - both get something that they need out of it; but if the roles lose any flexibility it can be hard to get out of the worn-in track when the situation changes and there's need for readressing the identities.\\n\\nA good couples counselor can help with emotion management - both yours and your wife's, and could help you express to your wife your need for healthy independence, in a non-threatening way she can hear. Just doing "your thing" on one side and "doing time" with your wife will leave at least half of both of your lives less than happy. Hope you try for the whole thing :-).
Sometimes when eating food you take a bite and feel something isn't right...  So you eat a bit more. \\nSo i guess it depends on what your eating really.\\n\\nFor example. I want out to a nice restaurant. \\nI ordered Reef and Beef.. my fave dish.\\nIt came out looking awesome.  the steak was awesome the sauces were awesome..  but the prawns were not that great.. tasted raw-ish and just not right.\\n\\nI'm not a prawn eating expert but i know they were not right. \\ni tried one at the start of the meal in the middle of the meal and eat the rest at the end.. hopping it was just me.\\n\\nMaybe its the same with with people that eat half a meal.. \\nthey are trying to work out what it is that dosent taste so bad.. if its just them or if its really the meal. \\n\\nBy the way. i did pass on my congratulations for the steak and sauces..  but to check on the prawns as they really didn't taste good.\\n\\nI was asked by the waitress at the time.. Did you try the prawns at the beginning of the meal.. as you might have left them to get cold.. i said yes i tried them  at the beginning, middle and end.. \\nIt was indeed the prawns...  my partner had the same dish same feeling and we both went home after paying fully. \\nHopping for no repercussions.. if you know what i mean.

More than likely they have a plan for this office already.  Someone has probably already beat you to the punch by lining up this office for themselves. What I would do is to ask around and see if anyone else knows about this office and what is going to be done with it.\\n  When you do go to your boss about this office you should come up with some good reasons why it would be important for you to have an office.  Do you recieve phone calls in which confidentiality would be important?  Do you think that this office would increase your productivity?  Do you have the space requirements that would merit an office?  \\n  Really what you gotta do is show that you have a need for the office and not just a want.

The Intolerable Acts, called by the British the Coercive Acts or Punitive Acts, were a series of laws passed by the British Parliament in 1774 in response to the growing unrest in thirteen American colonies, particularly in Boston, Massachusetts after incidents such as the Boston Tea Party. Enforcement of the Acts played a major role in the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War and the establishment of the First Continental Congress.\\nThis British cartoon, depicting the acts as asaults upon an anthropomorphic Boston, was quickly copied and distributed by Paul Revere to all the colonies. \\n\\nThe Coercive Acts included:\\n\\n    * Massachusetts Government Act\\n    * Administration of Justice Act\\n    * Boston Port Act\\n    * Quartering Act\\n\\nThe Quebec Act was also passed in 1774, but it was a piece of legislation unrelated to the Coercive Acts. American Whigs, however, were alarmed by the Quebec Act as much as the Coercive Acts, and they labeled it one of the "Intolerable Acts". Their main complaints over the Quebec Act were the protections granted to the Indian territories and to the Catholic settlers in Ohio. These were viewed as attempts to halt expansion into the west and to strengthen a church that many opposed.\\n\\nThe acts had several different effects. They unintentionally promoted sympathy for the revolutionaries in Massachusetts, and encouraged revolutionaries from the otherwise diverse colonies to band together. However, the Quebec Act had the opposite effect among French Catholics in the Province of Quebec, encouraging many of them to either pragmatic inaction or support for the Crown.
I have read it and enjoyed it. It really brought out the attitudes and historical elements of the south in the war.\\n\\nThis historical novel set in the Civil War era was first published in 1993 and is based on the extraordinary experience of one family in the South. The Civil War began with shots fired at Will McLean's house at Manassas and—by an amazing quirk of fate—ended with General Lee discussing surrender in the Appomattox house where McClean had moved his family to escape the war. Through the eyes of the narrator, Oscie Mason, readers can explore the impact of historical events on one family from 1852—when Will McLean becomes Oscie's new stepfather—to the end of the war.
Hmmmmm....Kobe... or.... Shaq? That's a hard one. NOT!!!!!!\\n\\nKobe Bryant kicked out the second best coach in NBA history, Phil Jackson, who is behind Red Auerbach. Kobe also kicked out the guy who won him more than just one championship, the big dog, Shaq himslef. Since Shaq has left, Kobe has... lemme think... missed the playoffs and got eliminated in the first round. Since Shaq has left L.A., Shaq has helped his team to a Game 7 in the Eastern Conference Finals and helped his team win the NBA Championship last year. Now I'm not saying Shaq is the best player on the Miami Heat roster, because everyone knows Dwayne Wade is better right now. Even Shaq knows that. BUT, Shaq is by far better than Kobe. Shaq will go down in the Hall of Fame as a better player than Kobe. No Doubt.

I am not familiar with the immigration law you are referring to, but I do know that it is a manuever of the business elite in developed countries around the world to hire immigrants, legal or illegal, because they can pay them lower wages and thereby increase their profits.  That's why the United States has an immigration problem.  Businesses want them here, and the government looks out for the interests of the business elite above all else.  As an American of French origin, I can tell you that I resent the French business elite being allowed to exploit the cheap labor of immigrants.  I see it as an attack on the French people's standard of living  as well as an attack on French culture itself, since these immigrants, mostlly from Arab countries, are so different culturally .
It's not clear what you're asking, but you can have a workers compensation claim recognized for torn bicep if you establish the condition exists and it is related to your work activity.  Whether you settle your claim, and for what amount, depends on what benefits you may be entitled to receive in the state where you live.  In general, you should consider the cost of past and future medical care, lost wages, and any permanent partial impairment awards available.  You may also be entitled to vocational rehabilitation if you are physically unable to return to the type of work you were doing at the time of your injury.  Good luck and best wishes for a full recovery.

As a southern cal boy, I had never known how Welsh "Jones" was until I played Detective Jones in Agatha Chritie's Spider Web.   I also enjoyed the challenge of working on the lyric Welsh accent.\\n\\n"Jones is a common family name that comes from the term 'Son of John' or 'Son of Joan' but can also be attributed to the name 'Jonah' – a name of Icelandic origins suggesting a Viking connection. It has further been suggested it derives from Germanic settlers in the United Kingdom with the name Johannes. It is also the most common last name in Wales, United Kingdom, and is the fourth-most common last name in the United States according to the U.S. Census. "

You can actually contaminate others with the radiation. However the risk is small and it depends on how much radiation therapy you recieved as well. \\n\\nRadio Active Iodine (RAI) is passed out of the body through all bodily fluids such as stool, urine, saliva and sweat therefore these are all potential forms of contamination. \\n\\nRadiation exposure is directly related to the amount of time you spend with another person as well as how intimate and close your contact is with them. Avoid prolonged, intimate physical contact with babies, children and pregnant women. \\n\\nFor a pretty easy site to follow, try http://cpmcnet.columbia.edu/dept/thyroid/raiprep.html\\n\\nGood luck with your treatment and get well soon!

In a standard mortgage your payments consist of a combination of interest and principal payments.  There are other mortgages/loans that are interest only payments.  And then there are horrible mortgages that you are actually paying less than interest payments.  This means that the principal is growing.

I'm not a dermatologist, but I can give you some advice b/c I have acne as well. They sell clearasil ultra at wal-mart. It is a 3 step system just like Proactive. I use both Proactive and Clearasil Ultra. They both work great. Just make sure you get the ULTRA. Also, in the pharmacy you can get this soap (facewash) called Panoxil bar. You don't need a prescription, but my dermatologist recommended it, & it indeed works great. Good luck!

arteries Always go Away from the heart, Veins always go toVards the heart (corny, i know). the pulmonary artery takes deoxygenated blood away from the heart and to the lungs, where it is oxygenated. the oxygenated blood goes from the lungs, through the pulmonary veins, and back to the heart. the oxygenated blood is then pumped through the aorta to the rest of the body.
i totally agree with u..some guys think that a women cant run the country..im surprised that we have not had any women presidents yet cuz even in a country like pakistan (where its totally all about guys) guys have to eat first, guys get to sleep more, no house chores for guys, guys dont have to do anything in the house excpet lay down,where husband is viewed as a women's god....even that country had a women president (banazier bohotto) and in USA where we supposedly see them as equals we have not had any women president.....\\n\\n\\nVOTE HILARY CLINTON
It depends upon your interest. If you love to study further then it is the best option, because here in Pakistan as far as industry is concerned no innovative work is being done in almost all areas (except Militry and Defence). If you choose to work in industry then you are only going to maintain the apparatus already innovated, there is nothing technical in it. However, if you love to enhance your technicalities and importance then it is better for you to go abroad.

Like many parts of the American political system, the idea of a cabinet was borrowed from Great Britain. Hundreds of years ago, the word cabinet referred to a small room, no bigger than a cabinet, that was located near the private rooms of the king or queen. The monarch's advisors would be brought to the cabinet for confidential discussions about the empire. The most trusted advisors visited the cabinet most often. They came to be called the cabinet counsel, or simply, the cabinet

Minerals are natural compounds formed through geological processes. The term "mineral" encompasses not only the material's chemical composition, but also the mineral's structure. Minerals range in composition from pure elements and simple salts to very complex silicates with thousands of known forms (organic compounds are excluded). The study of minerals is called mineralogy. To be classified as a "true" mineral, a substance must be a solid and have a crystal structure. It must also be an inorganic, naturally-occurring, homogeneous substance with a defined chemical composition.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNatural resources are naturally occurring substances that are considered valuable in their relatively unmodified (natural) form. A commodity is generally considered a natural resource when the primary activities associated with it are extraction and purification, as opposed to creation. Thus, mining, petroleum extraction, fishing, and forestry are generally considered natural-resource industries, while agriculture is not. Natural resources are often classified into renewable and non-renewable resources.

Well not every Muslim has become a terrorist in everybodies eyes. However Muslim people are being racially profiled because it saves time, money, and makes sense. Lets face it is not White, Black, Asians, Mexicans on and on that are straping bombs to themselves or crashing airplanes into buildings. I feel badly for the Muslim population that is being profiled but they should be thankfull they are not being interned like the Japenese during ww2. At the same time innocent people/journalist in their countries are being kidnaped and killed on video. The savage brutality of these senseless killings is very unnerving to America, especially when they film and mail it to us. (view videos at michaelsavage.com) Not to mention OBL keeps threatening us with sleepers. He is the biggest enemy of the average Muslim. My last point would be that there are no strong public speakers on behalf of the Muslims. I have been waiting for an intelligent well spoken Muslim to stand up and represent the American Muslim. I feel this would really help there cause.

I came here because of my deep interest and affection for a land settled by the Dutch in the mid-seventeenth century, then taken over by the British, and at last independent; a land in which the native inhabitants were at first subdued, but relations with whom remain a problem to this day; a land which defined itself on a hostile frontier; a land which has tamed rich natural resources through the energetic application of modern technology; a land which once imported slaves, and now must struggle to wipe out the last traces of that former bondage. I refer, of course, to the United States of America. \\n     But I am glad to come here to South Africa. I am already enjoying my visit. I am making an effort to meet and exchange views with people from all walks of life, and all segments of South African opinion, including those who represent the views of the government. Today I am glad to meet with the National Union of South African Students. For a decade, NUSAS has stood and worked for the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights--principles which embody the collective hopes of men of good will all around the world.\\n\\n     Your work, at home and in international student affairs, has brought great credit to yourselves and to your country. I know the National Student Association in the United States feels a particularly close relationship to NUSAS. And I wish to thank especially Mr. Ian Robertson, who first extended this invitation on behalf of NUSAS, for his kindness to me. It's too bad he can't be with us today.\\n\\n     This is a Day of Affirmation, a celebration of liberty. We stand here in the name of freedom.\\n\\n     At the heart of that Western freedom and democracy is the belief that the individual man, the child of God, is the touchstone of value, and all society, groups, the state, exist for his benefit. Therefore the enlargement of liberty for individual human beings must be the supreme goal and the abiding practice of any Western society.\\n\\n     The first element of this individual liberty is the freedom of speech: the right to express and communicate ideas, to set oneself apart from the dumb beasts of field and forest; to recall governments to their duties and obligations; above all, the right to affirm one's membership and allegiance to the body politic--to society--to the men with whom we share our land, our heritage, and our children's future.\\n\\n     Hand in hand with freedom of speech goes the power to be heard, to share in the decisions of government which shape men's lives. Everything that makes man's life worthwhile--family, work, education, a place to rear one's children and a place to rest one's head--all this depends on decisions of government; all can be swept away by a government which does not heed the demands of its people. Therefore, the essential humanity of men can be protected and preserved only where government must answer--not just to the wealthy, not just to those of a particular religion, or a particular race, but to all its people.\\n\\n     And even government by the consent of the governed, as in our own Constitution, must be limited in its power to act against its people; so that there may be no interference with the right to worship, or with the security of the home; no arbitrary imposition of pains or penalties by officials high or low; no restrictions on the freedom of men to seek education or work or opportunity of any kind, so that each man may become all he is capable of becoming.\\n\\n     These are the sacred rights of Western society. These were the essential differences between us and Nazi Germany, as they were between Athens and Persia.\\n\\n     They are the essence of our differences with communism today. I am unalterably opposed to communism because it exalts the state over the individual and the family, and because of the lack of freedom of speech, of protest, of religion, and of the press, which is the characteristic of totalitarian stat

Just because the Hindu religion has many dieties does not mean that a Hindu worships all of them. Some of them just focus only on one.\\n\\nWhen one focuses on too many dieties in their worship to aide their spiritual growth, that is spreading energies too thin and not creating much of a progress.\\n\\nAmma told a story of this devotee that when he went to go see a guru. This guru worshiped so many different dieties. This devotee started digging a hole when the guru worshiped a diety. Then when the guru would go to the next diety and pray to that one, and the devotee would stop digging the hole and move to dig another new hole. The devotee kept digging so many small holes for all of the different dieties. I don't have the exact wording of this story but the concept is that this devotee wasn't able to successfuly dig one deep hole.\\n\\nBy focusing on one diety, one can really seriously feel their energies more. Also just because one focuses on one diety does not mean they wouldn't partake in many of the cultural festivals that celebrate other dieties. That would be more of a holiday, cultural aspect rather than actually worshiping it on a daily basis.\\n\\nWhat Hindu is in "general" as a religion does not always mean that it is the same for a specific person.

Christopher Columbus (October 30, 1451? – 20 May 1506) was an explorer and trader, who crossed the Atlantic Ocean and reached the Americas on October 12, 1492 under the flag of Castile. History places great significance on his landing in America in 1492, with the entire period of the history of the Americas before this date usually known as Pre-Columbian, and the anniversary of this event, Columbus Day, being celebrated in many parts of America. Although there is evidence of Pre-Columbian trans-Atlantic Ocean European contact, Columbus is commonly credited as the first European to see the Americas because of the profound impact his contact wrought on history. His voyage marked the beginning of European exploration and colonization of the Americas.\\n\\nIt is generally assumed he was Genoese. However there is no solid evidence of this and historians claim he could have been born in other places, from the Crown of Aragón to the Kingdoms of Galicia or Portugal, or in the Greek island of Chios, among others. His birthname is also unknown; see the section on Columbus' national origin for a discussion of his origin and names.\\n\\n\\ncheck the rest of the link for more info.

I am circumcised. My father isn't. He took medical advice prevalent at the time that circumcision was beneficial but which has since been proved incorrect. If I could have my foreskin back, I would take it any day.\\n\\nThese days there are NO hygenic reasons for circumcision if you bathe at least once a day. There will therefore be no smell. Accusations otherwise are just born out of ignorance. If you consider most of European men, for instance, are uncircumcised, don't you think they would have moved to circumcision en masse long ago if circumcision was the most hygenic and correct thing to do?\\n\\nAlmost all other reasons for circumcision are now medically treatable and therefore, circumcision is unneccessary.\\n\\nFor women, an intact penis is DESIGNED to work better that a circumcised one because the foreskin allows for greater movement during sexual intercourse and less lubrication is required.\\n\\nIt is also better for the man because his glans is soft and sensitive - the glans on circumcised penises gets thick and hard over the years and decreases sensitivity and can even lead to erection problems.

Well, first find out what kind of wood your cheapy guitar is.Then if you look it up and its basswood, or something decent, change some stuff around. Better tuners are always nice, nothing sucks more then bad tuners going out when your playing. I dont honestly think the nut is gonna help unless its seriously ruined. Pickups are nice, but none of this even matters if your using cheap cables, and a cheap amp too. Everything has to be good quality or theres really no point in adding to your guitar.I mean if you get let say a pair of emgs put in, they would normally be great mid-high range guitar tones, but if your amp doesnt have good distortion and sounds grainy, well your upgrade is only doing half of what it should.The cheapest thing on my list is cables-bad cables suck tone.You could also get a nice lil graphic eq, they can help a lot for a lil money.

Salmonella typhi is similar to other salmonellae in that it is a gram-negative, flagellate, nonencapsulated, nonsporulating, facultative anaerobic bacillus that ferments glucose, reduces nitrate to nitrite, and synthesizes peritrichous flagella when motile. \\n\\nBeing such, you can use chloramphenicol, ampicillin (or any penicillin), Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, Ciprofloxacin (or any quinolone), a 3rd generation cephalosporin, or azithromycin.

I have an answer to this question. \\n\\nThe Christian Gospels mention Mary Magdalene a few times, with some confusion as to whether she and Mary of Bethany are the same person. Mary Magdalene is the only woman mentioned by name in all four gospels besides Mother Mary. She sinned more deeply, so she had more demons to eject. The number seven gives the clue.\\n \\nJesus healed Mary Magdalene of seven demons (Mark 16:9, Luke 8:2); Mary Magdalene came to the dinner at Simeon's house with an alabaster jar from which she anointed the head and feet of Jesus Christ (Mark 14:3-9, John 11:2, 12:3-8); and Mary Magdalene was the first to see Jesus Christ resurrected from the tomb (John 20, Mark 16:9, Matthew 28).

fire isn't in a class of matter at all. it's just light and heat, which aren't made up of particles at all (light is made up of photons, but their mass is negligible). plasma, by the way, is ionized gas.
Industrial wastes cause pollution in four major areas: air, water, soil and atmosphere. Those wastes that are gaseous pollute air that living things breath or use for food production as in plants. Gaseous wastes in air will either kill living things or disturb their normal processes. Gaseous pollutants also pollute our atmosphere that the atmosphere will lose its ability of blanketing the earth from hostile rays coming from the sun and space. Acid rain is as well caused by gaseous wastes. Wastes also pollute water bodies and soil and result in killing or disturbing the normal processes of living things specially plants.
From what I've read online, DTH is a satellite system, so this will not be possible unless you have a satellite dish receiver on your radio.  This is because satellites use frequencies on the order of about 15 GHz.  Your AM/FM radio antenna will only pick up frequencies up to about 110 MHz.  \\n\\nFurther, DTH signals are digital.  An AM/FM radio is purely analog.  Thus, even if you had a satellite dish that was the right size and pointed in the right direction, all you would hear is garbage.  The signals are compressed and encrypted, so you need hardware to convert the analog signal to digital, and then decompress and unencrypt the data.\\n\\nSo, in short, the answer is a definitive no. Sorry buddy.

Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.\\nif you still feel all the above from this man after all these years... then cherish him from today onward..

If you're using windows, the command prompt is very powerful and useful.  I assume that the 3 instances of "title" in your example represent 3 different names, right?  And that they all have the .mp3 extension, right? For a test, copy a few of the files to a new folder, open a command prompt window, and CD to that folder. \\nOpen a text editor and type or copy/paste the following: \\n@echo off\\nif "%1"=="" goto main\\nren "%1 %2" %2\\ngoto  exit\\n:main\\nfor %%i in ("?? *.mp3") do call %0 %%i \\n:exit\\n\\nNote there is a space between ("?? and *.mp3").\\nSave the text as temp.bat in the new folder.\\nIn the command prompt window, type "temp.bat" (no quotes) and hit enter.\\nThis should rename any file in that folder whose name begins with 2 characters and a space; the new name should be the same with the initial two characters and space removed.\\nIf this works you can CD to the folder containing all the files to be renamed, copy temp.bat to that folder and repeat the execution of temp.bat.

I am assuming that you are using Windows XP (with out without the service packs)\\nThe best way is to use the Windows "File and Settings transfer wizard.  Find this under Start->All Programs->Accessories->System tools->Files and Settings Transfer Wizard.  This will help you to transfer your files and most of the windows settings.  However you will have to reinstall most of the programs seperately in the new computer.\\n\\nFollow these steps\\n1. Run the wizard in your old computer.  If you can get a parallel cable to connect your old computer to the new one then choose that option.  Otherwise save the settings in a folder in your hard disk\\n\\n2. Open your old computer case and remove your hard disk.  Now open the case of your old computer and connect the hard disk to the new one.\\n\\n3.  Start the new computer and run the tool again.

This question could be interpreted two ways.\\n1st interpretation: "10%" = 0.10.\\nIn this case, the answer would simply be 6+0.10 = 6.10.\\n\\n2nd interpretation: "10%" = 10% of 6.\\nFirst, let's determine what 10% of 6 is.  To find 10% of 6, we must multiply 6 by 10% (remember that 10% is 0.10).\\n10% of 6 = 6*0.10 = 0.60\\nNow we must add that to our initial quantity.\\n6+0.60 = 6.60
Well, I believe in every country there will always be rude and discourteous people. On the flip side, there will also be polite and well-mannered people. Let's not compare why certain people are nicer than others. Let's face it, the human race ain't perfect at all. And each and everyone of us has our own set of perceptions and thinking with regards to other peoples. \\n\\nAnd remember, the survey is just a figure which can always change with time. \\n\\nBut on personal account, perhaps the reason why Singaporeans emerged 30th probably stems from the individualistic personality and due to lack of social cohesion. The 'culture' that puts one before the society perhaps may cause the lack of graciousness among some members of the society. It all boils down to the individual's family upbringing and environment, to a large extent. Hence, there are differing factors that might lead to the lack of courteousy among some Singaporeans.

Magnets are always dipoles. Always. This is Maxwell's second law of electromagnetism (Div B = 0). The divergence of a magnetic field always equals 0.\\n\\nThe magnetic moment would decrease for each part of the magnet, but the sum would remain the same. Magnetic moment equals pole strength times separation distance. Each individual magnetic moment would be unchanged, but the sum for each part would be less, and the total sum would be the same.

I sure hope you are smiling.\\n\\nIf you want some deep spiritual questions just stay tuned ha ha. I will soon start to asking questions that no one can answer ha ha. You just wait and see. Oh yes it will get stupid answers but I tell you I am sure no one will be right ha ha\\n\\nDo you think you know the Bible? then tell me with an absolute positive answer that no one, no not one can cause you to change your opinion in the future in regards to it. I am serious not joking.\\n\\nWhat color was Mr Adam's hair in the garden of Eden? Absolutely the bible tells all its precise color and length. Do you know it and this is no joke.

One mole of an ideal gas occupies a volume of 22.4 liters  at STP.  We can safely assume that HCl gas under STP conditions behaves pretty much like an idea gas, so 1.1 liter of HCl gas contains 1.1/22.4 moles of HCl.\\n\\nEach mole of HCl that reacts with NaOH produces one mole of NaCl.  Because we are told that the NaOH is in excess, the amount of NaCl formed will be equal to the amount of HCl gas.  In other words, 1.1/22.4 moles of NaCl will be formed.\\n\\nThe molecular mass of NaCl is 58.44 grams/mole, so the mass of NaCl formed will be:\\n\\n58.44 gm/mol * 1.1/22.4 mol = 2.87 grams.

Others have pointed out that it's not a waste of government money, but is it a waste of other folks' money?  I will say probably not.\\n\\nFirst of all, if we do detect intelligent signals that we wouldn't otherwise have detected, I don't suppose anyone could call it a waste of money, even if very large sums had been spent.\\n\\nBut even if we continue to not find anything, the project will not have been completely useless.  We'll still have learned a lot about our universe!  Namely, that there aren't any radio signal emitting civilizations within our ability to detect them.  That will, as is often the case in science, raise new questions.  Mainly, why don't we detect any other civilizations?  This is the Fermi Paradox.  See the attached article for information, I think it'll interest you.\\n\\nOf course, if the money and resources (radio telescope time, etc) spent on SETI could have gotten us more information about the universe if invested in other ways, then, yes, SETI would end up not having been worth it.  But it's difficult to say that unless we already know what we'll find (or fail to find).  And I'm not equipped to evaluate what use of science resources is best.  In the meantime, I'll enjoy what SETI has already told us about the universe and will eagerly await more data, whether that confirms that we are still alone in the known universe or whether we have company.

The flag, called "Tae Kuk," symbolizes the thought, philosophy, and mysticism of the Far East. \\n\\nThe circle in the center, red upper half and blue lower half, represents absolute, or the essential unity of all being. The Yang (positive) and the Yin (negative) divisions within the circle represent duality. Examples of duality are heaven and hell, fire and water, life and death, good and evil, or night and day \\n\\nThe four trigrams also indicate the duality of opposites and balances. In the upper left trigram, three unbroken lines symbolize Heaven; opposite them in the lower right, three broken lines represent Earth. In the upper right trigram, two broken lines separated by an unbroken line is the symbol of Water; opposite them is Fire, symbolized by two unbroken lines separated by a broken line. \\n\\nSymbolic of the nation is the white background (the land), the circle (people), and the four trigrams (the government).

I think I understand what you're going through. I recently had radiation therapy on my overactive thyroid gland, and I have gained a lot of weight! The problem in the US is that convenient and fast food means crappy and unhealthy food. I will only order things like fish and veggies, grilled chicken and veggies, and if I HAD to do fast food, get a grilled chicken salad with no croutons, and bring your own dressing. Unfortunately this is not a dieters world, and we just have to make the best of it! Why not bring along some Nutrition shakes "just in case"? I know finding the right foods to eat on the go is a lot harder than doing it at home. Best of luck to you! :)

We don't know when exactly when Jesus was born(could be the summer) and that case even the year. The bible is not persice when it comes to this matter so the do the early christian leaders do was genius. They want to mark a specific date to rebemer Jesus birth and they want to convert people aslo so.  So they pick a roman pagan holiday that was at the end of each year and replace it with the christain holiday christmas.  Christanity is very flexable at incorparting new thing to convert people. How do you thing the Christmas tree got started?
yes of course its possible, just not likely.  There are 1000's of celebs and most of them lead quite normal lives visiting normal places and bumping into normal people. so put simply yes !

The purpose of the Virgin Birth story in regards to Jesus was to give him a miracle birth like all the other dying/saving  man/gods of the ancient world. Many of them were born of a human mother and a god for a father. Even Hercules had a human mother, Elcmene, and Zeus for a father. Dionysus had Semele for his human mother and, again, Zeus for his father, and the death of Dionysus was seen by his follers as dying for their sins.\\n\\nWhat everyone forgets is that IF Jesus was born of a virgin, then he cannot trace his lineage back to King David, and he therefore could not have been the Messiah! Some might say that this was to prevent him from being a descendant of Jehoikim, Jeconiah, or Shealtiel whose descendants, like Joseph, were cursed and would preclude a descendant of them from being the Messiah. But you cant have your cake and eat it too. He cant get the benefit from being a descendant of David through Joseph, without the curse that comes from being a descendant of those three, if he is to claim being from the House of David through Joseph.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Bible makes it clear that the Real Messiah is not adopted into the Davidic Line, but must be a direct bloodline descendant through his own human father back to King David, through Solomon.\\n\\nAnd if one were to actually pick up the Bible and read it, one would see that every single genealogy in the Bible traces the lineage through the father. If a mother is mentioned it is because she was famous, but the lineage still goes through her husband and not her. This is also true in the Christians' New Testament, where both Matthew and Luke trace Jesus's lineage through the males. This means that even if Mary was a descendant of King David, it would not matter because one's lineage is traced through one's father, not one's mother.

Eisenhower developed the concept of the Interstate Highway. How does this relate to the war? Part of the plan was to enable quicker positioning of heavy combat units anywhere in America. Also, part of the highway plan involved making sure that there was a stretch of highway in any given distance that would be built straight enough to land our largest aircraft of that era.

I am a Real Estate Broker in Oregon and there is NO reason why the buyer should ever see what you owe on the home.  However a tax search can be pulled by anyone and that will tell the person doing the search what the amount of the last loan was and when(unless something has changed recently because tax searches on the internet are usually upto 6 months behind). Any agent or broker has the access to see what the taxes are on any property in the state which they are licensed in.  Good Luck!!

The quality of education is hampered because teachers are now being asked to teach children the social skills that families used to promote.  Unfortunately, as a teacher, all too many times I have to deal with issues that have absolutely nothing to do with what I want to teach my kids.  Children's behavior stymies the amount and quality of teaching that goes on every day.  When reflecting upon what the major cause for this, I always go back to the lack of caring many parents have towards their child's education.  Our society has fallen into the "it's all about me" syndrome, and parents aren't doing their part.  Our government is now working at holding the schools accountable for what is taught and the academic success of the students attending, but until parents are held just as accountable, then our schools (especially those in the urban arenas) are going to continue to struggle.  Thanks for the question Joe.
People have been saying that Jesus didn't really die on the cross since not long after he was crucified.  Did he die on a cross?  I don't know.  I figure that's where faith comes in.

The odds are very poor whether you are in Australia or US -- unless you have something to provide the bank as collateral. A restaurant is not something that you can do for $1000 only -- you need more; and for a financial institution to give you a loan, you need to show that you are capable of repaying the loan, that you have a strong business, you have experience in the business or a strong management team will help you, you have collateral and you have the right character. Banks simply want to make sure that they can get their money bank. Right now, with your conditions, you are too-high risk to be provided with a loan.

Celiac sprue (AKA celiac disease or Gluten-Sensitive Enteropathy), is a chronic disease of the digestive tract.  It is a *genetic* disease that is characterized\\nby autoimmune damage to the mucosal lining of the small intestine when gluten is ingested.\\n\\nPeople with CS cannot tolerate gluten in any form (gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, barley and some oats).  When gluten is ingested by people with the disease, the mucosa of their intestines is damaged by an immunologically mediated inflammatory response, which results in maldigestion and malabsorption.\\n\\nSymptoms vary but can include severe gas pain, stomach pain, malodorous and oily stools and/or profuse diarrhea, and weight loss.\\n\\nBecause it is a genetic, inheritable disease, there is no true prevention.  However, there are things that can be done to help manage it, most notably, dietary changes.\\n\\nThe Celiac Sprue Association can be very helpful to those interested in or living with the disease.  You can see them online at http://www.csaceliacs.org.  Hope that helps.

It seems to go around the net because groups like Chick Publications put in out there that this happened.  I believe the origin of this particular urban myth comes from the retranslation of the KJV in the 1890's.  Whole denominations' reasons for existence winked out of existence with that event.  Also, people have edited the bible throughout history but generally not in a malicious way.  A clarification here or there, and edit etc by people who did not always have the best text to work from.  In that limited sense people did add or subtract, but it doesn't affect us today.  It is also probably exaggerated by the prior existence of more slanted texts done so as to support a particular theological cause.  This is mostly rare now and isn't done to support theology so much as internal church politics and audience needs.  Using multidenominational translation teams put and end to the likelihood of that occuring.\\n\\nThe other thing is a misunderstanding of the deuterocanonical books.  They were not added, Luther removed them.  They had always been there.  The only major early authority who suggest their removal is Jerome and I believe Anthanasius, but Anthanasius has I believe seven additional texts in his New Testament.\\n\\nAlso most people are unaware of the process by which the books were assembled into a canon for all of Christianity.  They are not aware that it was the Pope who promulgated the list and it is on Papal authority that the list rests.  A local synod at Carthage, following the work of one at Hippo Regius and a local synod at Rome sent their lists to the Pope.  He promulgated the list using his authority, also with a list of excluded books and so closed the issue until Luther.  Luther did remove James, Jude, Revelations and the Deuterocanonicals as they didn't agree with him.  The charge ever since is that Catholics added books to the bible.
There are bits and pieces throughout the responses that are correct.  \\n\\nThe Marines are within the Department of Defense.  However, within the DoD they are administratively attached to the Department of the Navy which is led by the Secretary of the Navy.  A Marine 4-star is on the Joint Chiefs of Staff (one is currently the Chairman) as is a Navy 4-star.  So, for all intents and purposes they are their own branch of the military but due to traditions and history they have not been given their own department within the DoD.  Although, I believe there is  probably a large majority of senior Marines that would like their own Dept even though falling within the Dept of the Navy is really only administrative.\\n\\nIt's just the history that at one time they were the Naval Infantry.  There is no reason to not think of them as their own entity.

I am a mom and the BEST thing I ever got was a homemade card from my little girl and I will cherish it til the day I leave this earth. I am a very sentimental person and she had put alot of work in her gift, and believe me it was the BEST "gift" any mom should get.

Don't point blank ask, "Can you cook clean and sew." Instead, re-phrase this as:  "It's been so long since I've had a good home cooked meal."  If she's good at cooking, she'll want to show off for you, and she'll offer to cook you that meal.  If you get her to cook that meal for you, then acidently <wink-wink> pop a button from your shirt.  If she's good and caring, again, she'll lovingly offer to help you repair it.\\n\\n2.  Don't demand this.  Remember, not all woman have these talents.  In fact, with the high divorse rates, many woman were raised by men, or working mom's.  Many of us feel inadequite because we don't have these skills < like how a man feels without an income or how he feels if he has small male genetiles >...it's a hurtful subject to certain people, so be respectful <thx>.  Plus, our educational system does not provide training for this anymore.  Be kind and respectful to the woman who arn't skilled in this.  Maybe you'll get a lawyer/accountant/CEO FRIEND who'll help in in the future.  I belive you can never have enough friends.\\n\\nGood luck and best wishes.
a "biopsy" is the removal of some tissue or organ from the living body.  \\nas for how it's done, there are 5 types listed :\\n\\n*aspiration biopsy : in which the tissue is obtained by suction through a needle and syringe\\n\\n*cone biopsy : in which an inverted cone of tissue is excised, as from the uterine cervix\\n\\n*excisional biopsy : removal of an entire lesion and significant portion of normal-looking tissue for examination\\n\\n*needle biopsy : tissue obtained by the puncture of a lesion with a needle.  rotation of the needle removes tissue within the lumen of the needle\\n\\n*punch biopsy : tissue obtained by a punch
if those are the dimensions, then it is not a cube. a cube has equal dimensions all the way around:\\n\\nbase = length = height \\n\\nthis is a rectangular prism\\n\\nvolume = base * height * length\\n\\nvolume = 6 * 4 * 2\\n\\nvolume = 48 cubic inches\\n\\n\\nthe surface area would be the area of the six rectangles that make up the "skin" of the prism.\\n\\ntwo rectangles will have an area of: 6 * 4 = 24\\ntwo rectangles will have an area of: 4 * 2 = 8\\ntwo rectangles will have an area of: 2 * 6 = 12\\n\\ntherefore the total surface area will be:\\n\\n= 2(24) + 2(8) + 2(12)\\n= 48 + 16 + 24\\n= 88 square inches

You need to speak to a librarian at a medical college. Libraries will have several related journals and a librarian can give you some insight into which of the journals are preferred and respected. It may be that some journals are more authoritative on certain topics than others -- A librarian should know that.
By being on time, you show that you take your responsibilities seriously.  You also show that you honor others' efforts to help you, because no one should have to wait for you to show up late for an appointment or meeting.\\nHope these ideas are helpful.

Most home appliances don't give off enough of an EMF to affect us, at least so far as any studies have been able to determine.  Higher energy appliances like microwaves were once shielded rather badly, resulting in the warning in all the instruction manuals not to stand close to a running microwave if you have a pacemaker or internal defibrillator, because the stray EM could cause it to malfunction (I believe they've solved the shielding problem in modern models, but the warning's still there, just in case)  Just in case, I'd sit back a ways from the TV... luckily, the new LCD computer monitors put out considerably less EM (almost none, really)  These days, there are more hazards from the incidental (or intended) output other than stray EM -- tanning beds put out UV light that can damage skin over the long term or cause blindness if you don't wear the goggles properly, copy machines and faxes create ozone which can damage the lining of the lungs, etc.

I understand homosexuality is not illegal in S.A., but his situation is very difficult from what you say. In my opinion, what he could do –I know it can be difficult- is keep aside his sexual trends for the time being so that his father may regain confidence in him and at least, allow him to get a degree in some career or other. And when he has finally being able to start an independent life of his own then he will be able to openly show his sexuality in South Africa or wherever he chooses to live.\\nAfter all, there are thousands of young men that do not start having any sexual activity until they get married, although you may find it hard to believe, and that means finishsing their studies first and finding a job afterwards.\\nLife is not always easy, and you can tell this youn boy he will not die if he tries to disguise his true feelings for a few years and behave accordingly.\\nCurious98

It sounds to me that you're bathing her too often and drying her skin out.  I'd let her go a day or two between baths, just sponge bathe her.  Use lots of moisturizer on her.

What Is REM Sleep?\\n\\nUsually, REM sleep occurs 90 minutes after sleep onset. The first period of REM typically lasts 10 minutes, with each recurring REM stage lengthening, and the final one may last up to an hour. Polysomnograms show brainwave patterns in REM to be similar to that recorded during wakefulness. In people without sleep disorders, heart rate and respiration speed up and become erratic during REM sleep. During this stage the eyes move rapidly in different directions.\\n\\nIntense dreaming occurs during REM sleep as a result of heightened brain activity, but paralysis occurs simultaneously in the major voluntary muscle groups. REM is a mixture of encephalic (brain) states of excitement and muscular immobility. For this reason, it is sometimes called paradoxical sleep.\\n\\nThe percentage of REM sleep is highest during infancy and early childhood. During adolescence and young adulthood, the percentage of REM sleep declines. Infants can spend up to 50% of their sleep in the REM stage of sleep, whereas adults spend only about 20% in REM.
Characteristics of Red Sprites\\n\\nSprites are massive but weak luminous flashes that appear directly above an active thunderstorm system and are coincident with cloud-to-ground or intracloud lightning strokes. Their spatial structures range from small single or multiple vertically elongated spots, to spots with faint extrusions above and below, to bright groupings which extend from the cloud tops to altitudes up to about 95 km. Sprites are predominantly red. The brightest region lies in the altitude range 65-75 km, above which there is often a faint red glow or wispy structure that extends to about 90 km. Below the bright red region, blue tendril-like filamentary structures often extend downward to as low as 40 km. Sprites rarely appear singly, usually occurring in clusters of two, three or more. Some of the very large events, such as shown in Figure 1, seem to be tightly packed clusters of many individual sprites. Other events are more loosely packed and may extend across horizontal distances of 50 km or more and occupy atmospheric volumes in excess of 10,000 cubic km. \\n\\nHigh speed photometer measurements show that the duration of sprites is only a few ms. Current evidence strongly suggests that sprites preferentially occur in decaying portions of thunderstorms and are correlated with large positive cloud-to-ground lightning strokes. The optical intensity of sprite clusters, estimated by comparison with tabulated stellar intensities, is comparable to a moderately bright auroral arc. The optical energy is roughly 10-50 kJ per event, with a corresponding optical power of 5-25 MW. Assuming that optical energy constitutes 1/1000 of the total for the event, the energy and power are on the order of 10-100 MJ and 5-50 GW, respectively.\\n\\nIf sprites are only barely detectable by the unaided human eye, in intensified television images obtained from the ground and from aircraft they appear as dazzlingly complex structures that assume a variety of forms\\n\\nCharacteristics of Blue Jets\\n\\nBlue jets are a second high altitude optical phenomenon, distinct from sprites, observed above thunderstorms using low light television systems. As their name implies, blue jets are optical ejections from the top of the electrically active core regions of thunderstorms. Following their emergence from the top of the thundercloud, they typically propagate upward in narrow cones of about 15 degrees full width at vertical speeds of roughly 100 km/s (Mach 300), fanning out and disappearing at heights of about 40-50 km. Their intensities are on the order of 800 kR near the base, decreasing to about 10 kR near the upper terminus. These correspond to an estimated optical energy of about 4 kJ, a total energy of about 30 MJ, and an energy density on the order of a few mJ/m^3. Blue jets are not aligned with the local magnetic field.

great question, ty. The history is clear. Neocons have long wanted the USA out of the UN. They do not support peaceful contact with other Nations. The Neocons always point to the fact that we pay the most. The truth is they do not want to share any power with anyone. They also have no interest in what the other countries think or say. Neocons like Bu$h think "my way or the highway". A UN peacekeeping force could be in Iraq now (no ours) but for giving up the power and the control of oil, the wealth and the Contracts.\\nThe Saudis are not stupid. When they felt Saddam was going to invade and control the oil, they got US tax payers to pay for the defense of the oil. Saddam was a Arab problem, Arabs got the US tax payers to solve the problem.  \\nWe also deal with the loss of life and money for our own people. The Saudis should pay the $6 billion per month in Iraq not USA tax payers.

Yea.  This is my favorite friggin' drinking game.\\n\\nThe entire deck is dealt to however many people are playing (you need at least 3 and more than 7 or 8 gets tough).  The person with the three of clubs goes first on the first hand.\\n\\nOrganize your cards by number.  Seperate pairs or triples.\\nYou need to play either the same number or higher than the person before you.  You can't play doubles unless the first person who started the round puts down doubles.\\n\\nIf you can't play a card, you drink.  The round clears if it's your turn again and nobody played on the card you threw.  When it clears, you can throw down any card you want.  \\n\\nHere are some important rules once you get the idea:\\n1.) a two clears the board.  play these when the numbers get too high (ex. Aces) or when there's a pair and you can't go.\\n2.) fours are social.  If you have a four, you can lay it down on anything (even doubles).  Everyone at the table hits glasses and has a drink.\\n3.) When you only have one card left, you have to say "last card."  If you don't, you are automatic @$$hole for the next game.  If somebody else messes this up after you, they are @$$hold instead.\\n4.) You can't go out on a two or four (ie: clear or social).  If you do, you're automatic @$$hole.\\n5.) If you play the same number card as the person before you, the person who plays after you is skipped and they have to drink.\\n\\nThe first person to get rid of all their cards is the president.  The last is the @$$hole.  The @$$hole gets people drinks, shuffles the cards, deals, gives their best card to the president and gets the presidents worst card in return, and drinks whenever somebody tells them to.  But be careful, it might be you next hand.\\n\\nYou will keep track of the order in which people get rid of their cards.  You can tell people to drink if you are above them.\\n\\nThere are some other rules too, but this should get you a good start.

Very much depends on how much money you have to invest and how long you want to invest it.  Today as interest rates are going up, I would be cautious about real estate.

It depends upon the other outstanding bids.\\n\\nIf it is on the NASDAQ and the bid is 49 and the ask is 49.50 and you offer to buy at 49.25 and you are the only bidder, then you should become the new bid price raising the bid/ask to 49.25 and 49.50.  If there are other bids that may not happen.\\n\\nIf it is on the exchanges, then you are bidding outside the range.  You will limit the prices when the current best offer is taken, presuming no one else will make an intervening bid.\\n\\nMarket makers cannot bid against the street, BUT if there are other outstanding orders, they are not bidding against the street.  So they may keep the old if there are outstanding valid prices because your purchase offer is not in the money as the high bid.
It applies directly to DC and only sort of to AC.\\n\\nThe problem with AC is the power. If you drive a perfect inductor or capacitor, you will have voltage and current, but no power.  In real life, the load of an AC circuit has both reactance (capacitive or inductive) and resistance, so there will be power drawn, but in a more complex manner than simply P=IE.\\n\\nThe load is complex also, the inductance and capacitance are 180 degrees out of phase with each other and 90 degrees out of phase with a real (resistive) load. So when you add them you need to use trigonometry.\\n\\nDon't even ask about RF circuits. It is another order of magnitude higher in difficulty.

Cholesterol is a certain lipid used for various causes in the organism: it is a major constituent of membranes, a precursor of bile acids, steroid hormones etc. \\nThe terms "bad" and "good" cholesterol reffer not to cholesterol itself ('cause chemically it is all the same), but the vehicles by which it is transported in the blood stream. The are two major types of cholesterol vehicles: LDL (low density lipoproteins) and HDL (high density lipoproteins). HDL transport cholesterol from organs and tissues to the liver, which excrets it. Therefore, higher levels of HDL are "good", since they help to get rid of excess cholesterol. LDL, on the other hand, transport cholesterol from the liver to various organs and tissues. Of course, it is a necessary function, but if there's too much LDL, it is "bad", since, simply speaking, it packs vascular walls with cholesterol, which ultimately leads to cardiovascular diseases. \\nIt is not quite clear whether cholesterol rich foods really increase the "bad" LDL levels. However, it is very likely that if you eat oatmeal instead of a ribeye steak, your bad cholesterol levels will go down, since plant-derived products do NOT contain cholesterol. Cholesterol is found only in animal products (meat, eggs, dairy).

Ligaments connect bones to other bones to form a joint.\\n\\nCartilage is a type of dense connective tissue. Cartilage is composed of cells called chondrocytes which are dispersed in a firm gel-like ground substance, called the matrix. Cartilage is avascular (contains no blood vessels) and nutrients are diffused through the matrix. Cartilage is found in the joints, the rib cage, the ear, the nose, in the throat and between intervertebral disks. There are three main types of cartilage: hyaline, elastic and fibrocartilage. The main purpose of cartilage is to provide a framework upon which bone deposition could begin.

Usually not. Just get a list of proposed immunizations. Remember the second hep b vaccine some areas of the U.S. received? Well those specified areas had a rise in other acute illnesses. Only allow that which is of the norm and research any "new" proposed vaccination. Do what you feel is right, and chances are you can not go wrong. There are no stupid questions when health and safety are concerned.

A big part of confidence is in the way you carry yourself.  Stand up straight.  Think of a straight line going up your legs and spine straight to the top of your head and align your stance to it.  Smile when you see people, and look them in the eye (briefly, don't stare).  Think of yourself as the confident person you want to be, and imagine the positive reactions of those around you.  Make a practice of this regularly.  You may not only find this enjoyable, but there is scientific evidence it actually works to boost confidence in people who practice it regularly.  Good luck!
Kamehameha, also known as Kamehameha I and Kamehameha the Great (circa 1758-1819), unified the Hawaiian Islands in battle and formally established the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi in 1810. A skilled diplomat, Kamehameha developed friendships with the major colonial powers in the Pacific resulting in the preservation of independence, as well as a guarantee of peace and prosperity of the kingdom, for future generations of native Hawaiians. Kamehameha is most noted for his vehement defense of traditional Hawaiian values and the kapu system of law and religion. He is also remembered for mamalahoe or the Law of the Splintered Paddle, used today throughout the world protecting the human rights of non-combatants in times of battle.

Mix a solution of one part bleach to one part water. Spray on mold and mildew spots and gently rub. Let sit for 15 minutes and re-apply if it dries out. Rinse thoroughly. If Mold stain is still there use pure bleach. Bleach is the only thing that will kill the mold/mildew and if you don't kill the mold/mildew it will spread. If the canvas leaks in those spots afterwards apply "Camp-Dry" spray on waterproofer to reseal. It's available at your local hardware or Walmart.\\nGood Luck and Happy Camping!!!!

Because these people on here have no idea what they are talking about.  they dont see or care that the mexicans are NOT taking jobs but doing jobs lazy proudful Americans dont want.  Illegals are here because Immigration laws are ridiculous.  People who are poor and desprete to feed their kids cant afford the high cost, or the time it takes to come here to legal way, is this their fault?  NOOO Its the systems fault.  If your kid was starving you had no money, would you not steal to feed them?  Same thing for the illegals people.  YES to immigration reform, make a way to HELP these people get what they need to work here, But you fools need to get INFORMED.  Mexicans ADD to this country weather you like it or not we NEED them.\\n\\nAll of you who complain and open your big mouths about stuff you know nothing about are the fist to be signed up for cotton duty when the illegals leave.  18 cents a bushal, 16 hour days, 7 days a week.  you want them gone?  Ok then you take their jobs!!  Any takers....I bet not so shut up.\\n\\nIllegals are NOT eligabile for welfare so stop all the lying.  Without a social security card they are denighed, fack papers took, and they are charged with fraud.\\n\\n**Illegals DO pay taxes UNLESS they are paid in cash.  You forget some Americans too avoid taxes by being paid in cash, but I see no complaints to that...Illegals who are paid by check pay taxes they just dont get a return....GET INFORMED your comments are false.\\n\\nP.S.  It is obvious by the lack of intelligance here, that most posters are just wanting something to argue about and not really intrested in the facts.

The moon will not escape Earth orbit. It is currently moving away from us at only 38 mm/year, due to energy transferred by tidal forces. The energy transfer is also causing Earth's day to become longer (currently it is increasing by 15 microseconds each year).\\n\\nTheoretically, the moon's orbit would increase until the Earth's day slows to match the Moon's orbital period. After this point, solar tides will dominate and the Moon will start moving closer to Earth.\\n\\nBefore this happens, the Sun will become a red giant (5 billion years from now).

Depends on what actually happened to give us more or less chromosomes.  In humans, the most likely reason someone would have more or less chromosomes would be nondisjunction (an uneven split of chromosomes) in gametogenesis (process of making sperm or eggs).\\n\\nMost often, nondisjunction does not produce viable offspring.  They die within the first few weeks of gestation.  Some nondisjuncted offspring do come to term, but have some pathological problem.  Some common diseases that arise from nondisjunction are:\\n\\nDown's syndrome \\nEdward's syndrome \\nKlinefelter's syndrome\\nPallister-Killian syndrome \\nPatau syndrome \\nTurner syndrome \\nXYY syndrome \\nXXX syndrome
Nurses in clinics are the mid-level practioners of medical care and assessments.  They will often screen patients (called Triage) to determine exactly what the baseline problem is and prepare the doctors space to quickly and efficiently do his own assessment.\\n\\nIf medications are needed, the doctor will provide orders and the nurse will then follow up with this part of the patients care.\\n\\nIn the case of Nurse Practitioners, they are often primary care givers in the place of doctors and can do many assessments with the backing of a physician in the clinic.  They can provide perscriptions for certain medications and do assessments such as PAP smears, etc.

glad that you realised that you are going to a crappy school.. (some people never do) now that you know what a crappy school looks like and how they are structured, i would just go to various martial arts club in your area ask.. to sit in and watch a lesson or even ask to attend 1 lesson for free... since you have experienced a crap school you'll be pretty aware of what to look out for now and what questions to ask.. ask them about thier grading processes and if they require you to pay any extra fee's for this, does all the equipment get supplied or do you have to purchase your own (big money making scheme for most schools..they should provide you the basic equipment and when you do have to buy something you should have the freedom to get this equipment from anywhere.. not just purchase it from the school only).. ahh whether you have to lock into a 12 month contract (don't) alot can happen in 12 months.. a good school will let you buy a 10 or 20 class pass or let you pay casually or give you the option to sign up in 3 or 6 month blocks.. and a big giveaway look at the type of students which attend the classes.. how competent do they look for their level.. are people that have higher belt ranks overweight.. (they shouldn't be at that level they should be a certain fitness to get to the level they are at, if they are overwieght the belts are obviously getting handed out).. how old are the instrutors?? are they all 18 - 23yrs old another warning there.. they should be  ideally very late 20's or above.. that way you know that your instructor has the adequite knowledge to teach the art.. just some small factors to be mindfull of that will hopefully help when finding a new dojo to train at.. Hopefully you will find a style you enjoy soon.. as for real life effectiveness.. I would look into styles like Brizilian Ju Jitsu, Muay Thai, Krav Maga or the likes..

After the United States killed Osama bin Laden, he was met at heaven's gates by George Washington who punched him in the stomache.  Thomas Jefferson kicked him in the groin, Benjamin Franklin electrocuted him with with his kite key, and 46 other guys beat him up really bad.  When they all left, Osama walked up to God and asked, "Hey, what's going on here, I thought..."  God knew what he was going to ask, so he answered him quickly, "I told Muhammad that you would be met by 49 Virginians, what did you think I said?"

Summary of the eRumor\\nThis piece of alleged history explains that in the olden days of sailing ships, cannon balls were stacked on the decks on brass plates called "monkeys."  The plates had indentions in them that held the balls on the bottoms of the stacks.  Brass, however, expands and contracts with the temperature and if it got cold enough, the cannon balls could fall...giving real foundation to the phrase "cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey!"  \\n \\n \\n The Truth\\nAccording to the United States Navy Historical Center, this is a legend of the sea without historical justification.  The center has researched this because of the questions it gets and says the term "brass monkey" and a vulgar reference to the effect of cold on the monkey's extremities, appears to have originated in the book "Before the Mast" by C.A. Abbey.  It was said that it was so cold that it would "freeze the tail off a brass monkey."   The Navy says there is no evidence that the phrase had anything to do with ships or ships with cannon balls.

Lean manufacturing is a management philosophy focusing on reduction of the 7 wastes (Over-production, Waiting time, Transportation, Processing, Inventory, Motion and Scrap) in manufactured products. By eliminating waste (muda), quality is improved, production time is reduced and cost is reduced. Lean "tools" include constant process analysis (kaizen), "pull" production (by means of kanban) and mistake-proofing (poka yoke).\\n\\nI think this is what you were lookin for... :)

Most states have a redemption period, but there is a catch: You have to redeem the loan and any fees and accrued interest for cash.  In other words, you have to either find the cash from somewhere (unlikely) or get someone to loan it to you (equally unlikely).\\n\\nIn this case, you say you want to sell the property.  It is too late for that.  You needed to do that *before* the trustee's sale.  No lender in the world is going to agree to that request.  They've already gone and spent the money for default, lost all the interest and payments and everything, sat on this non-performing loan for months and months, and after they finally decide you're not going to save it and they bite the bullet and foreclose, and suddenly, now that it's no longer yours, you want to sell?  Ask a lawyer in your state, but I don't think you're going to have much luck with that one.\\n\\nFurthermore, it's not like people didn't try to tell you.  Anywhere in the country, as soon as that Notice of Default hit, you had real estate agents and lawyers and hard money lenders by the dozen trying to talk to you.  Yeah, they were trying to sell you something.  That doesn't alter the fact that the most important thing they told you was that you needed to take some kind of action right then, and whatever else they told you, that much was the truth.\\n\\nI know this is going to be hard to accept.  That doesn't change the facts.  You agreed to pay the loan back.  You didn't.  Furthermore, you did nothing with that grace period (absolute minimum of about seven months here in California) that the law gives you in which to act.  Forget that property.  It is gone.  Move forward and get on with your life.
Most states have a penal code section for justifiable homicide.  You would be commiting homicide, you would just have to explain why you did it.  I am sure the kid would be a witness for you. Officers commit justifiable homicide when they kill someone in an officer involved shooting incident.  The issue you have however, is you're not a cop, therein you would have a harder time justifying why you used the amount of force you used.  I say, "you would have a harder time," because police officers are in use of force situations daily, therein, they deal with the use of force more often and can articulate their reasons for shooting a bad guy.  Nonetheless, even the officer would be represented by extremely well-trained council.

I have done quite a bit of legwork on this issue, and have not had much success in finding out how someone who is not a US citizen might get a teaching job, even though I understand there is a shortage of teachers.  \\n\\nSo far I have found out that you have to find a school district that is willing to sponsor you.  I have contacted many districts, and quite a few reply, but so far I have not found one that sponsors someone who is not a US citizen.  \\n\\nIf your country of origin makes you eligible for the green card lottery you may be successful that way.  I am not eligible since I am Canadian.\\n\\nDo a state by state search for school districts and begin making contacts.  Also begin to check out teacher certification in the state you are interested in as requirements can vary.  As far as I can understand, some states accept the credentials of other states and some do not.  Not all international credentials are accepted so you also need to check that out.  You will have to write some exams in order to become qualified in any case.  YOu can find sample exams in all the different areas on line.\\n\\nI have included some sites that may be helpful to you.

Make sure all youre computers are in the same workgroup\\n4. If the printer has a network card connect it to the network and assign it an IP address (like explained for the computers). The u set up set up printing using the printers network address. If it doesn't have a network card connect it to a computer and turn that computer into a print server (or buy a print server if you wish) and set up printing on the other computers by pointing them to the print server (on the print server make sure the printer is shared)

Gun control had never worked.  Please provide a link so that your "proof" can be seen.  Assault weapons have been illegal to own since 1968 (unless you get a special class III license from the B.A.T.F.) so I don't understand your problem there.  You need to read the book by John Lott .  "More Muns, Less Crime".  Also,  the FBI recently did a study that shows that from 1991 to 2005, Americans have bought 70,000,000 guns, yet crime, since '91 has decreased by 38%.  I can't find this study on-line, I read about it in a magazine.  Concealed carry works also.  Florida's 2005 murder rate was 58% lower than in 1986, which was the year before Florida adopted (wisely) Right to Carry laws.  There are already many laws  to keep the wrong people from buying firearms.  The problem is that for some reason, criminals will not obey the law!!  They keep acquiring guns illegally.  So more laws are obviously not the answer.  Laws only affect the law abiding.  And by the way, I am NOT a conservative.  But, I believe that since guns do not kill, people do, then people should take the responsibility and the punishment, not guns.

First, you are not alone.  There are many out there that are "stuck" in the mire of what to do when we grow up.\\n\\nWith that said, I would encourage you to think about some of the following things:\\n1.  What do you enjoy doing?  What can you do and lose total track of time while doing it?\\n2.  What are your strengths?  You can find out by reading the book "Now, Discover Your Strengths", by Donald Clifton and Marcus Buckingham.  There is also an on line assessment you can take by buying the book and it can help you determine your signature talents.  \\n3.  What kind of lifestyle do you want to have?  What kind of income does that require?  \\n4.  What are your values?  What matters most to you?\\n\\nAnswering the above questions will help you start a journey of self discovery and awareness about how to take action.  There are fundamental career decisions everyone has to make and by digging deeper into your needs you can paint a clear path to happiness, but it starts with action.\\n\\nI would also recommend taking a few classes at a local junior/community college to see what might peak your interests.  While enrolled, utilize any and all career services  they have to assist you in making a well informed decision.\\n\\nI hope this helps!

Did you take any "after" pics to show exactly what WASN'T cleaned? \\n\\nJust some suggestions, that sucks. The best bet is to go with the news.
The Second Punic War broke out in 218 when Hannibal took control of the Greek city and Roman ally, Saguntum (in Spain). Rome thought it would be easy to defeat Hannibal, but Hannibal, leaving 20,000 troops with his brother Hasdrubal, went further north on the Rhone River than the Romans expected and crossed the river with his elephants on flotation devices. \\n\\nHannibal reached the Po Valley with less than half his men. He had also encountered unexpected resistance from local tribes, although he did manage to recruit Gauls. This meant he had 30,000 troops by the time he met the Romans in battle. \\n\\nHannibal won battles in Trebia and at Lake Trasimene, and then continued through the Apennine Mountains. With troops from Gaul and Spain on his side, Hannibal won another battle, against Lucius Aemilius, in which the Romans lost thousands of troops, including their leader. The historian Polybius describes the both sides of this, the Battle of Cannae, as gallant, and says of the losses:\\n--\\nHannibal's army in Iberia reportedly totaled 90,000 infantry and 12,000 cavalry, although those figures probably include Hasdrubal's forces as well as Hannibal's. The expeditionary force would still number as many as 75,000 foot soldiers and 9,000 horsemen. His army also had an unknown number of war elephants. \\n\\nAfter completing his overland journey, Hannibal descended from the foothills into northern Italy. He had arrived, however, accompanied by only half the forces he had started with, and only a few elephants. In total, Hannibal had lost as many as 20,000 men and all but three of his war elephants
how are you coping!!!!!!!
People are susceptible because people are afraid. Just like everything else in life, they are afraid of their bodies, their minds, their thoughts. When we grow up and realize that we don't have an infinite amount of time of this planet, people turn to what they have been taught. That there is a better life after death but you have to follow a path to get there. Therefore religion steps in and tries to turn your fear of death to faith instead giving hope. However, no one really knows what happens after we die so its a crap shoot.

Because people frequently go into a doctor's office complaining and get really upset if the doctor doesn't do something for their cold. Doctor's like to make money and they only make money if they have patients who are happy. Therefore, they prescribe antibiotics just to make sure their patients are satisfied.
I picked the Mets to win in 2006....I just like their lineup.  Starters might not be the greatest but they probably don't have to be.  Solid bullpen with Billy Wagner closing things out, a bounce back year from Carlos Beltran, Delgado, Wright and Reyes doing what they normally do and I like the Mets chances.  Maybe i'm dreaming too....
I DO REALLY BELIVE THAT IS OK FOR EVERYONE TO CRY.

I PERSONALY WOULD SAY THAT I FIND IT VERY ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE IT SHOWS TO ME THAT HE HAS FEELINGS... BUT DON'T USE IT TO GET A GIRL... THAT'S WRONG...

I've been thinking the same thing. Because of the wacky answers I've seen on this site, I have spent the last few on-call nights directing people to get proper treatment. \\n\\nI think this section is a disaster waiting to happen. It only takes one person to convince a patient to delay treatment. I've said it before it takes more than typing www.webmd to give accurate medical advice. \\n\\nTo the Kate person, you might think differently if your grandmother were given bad info from someone making a joke, or selling their "cure-all". Freedom of information isn't always a good thing. Disease doesn't recognize democracy. Your chlorine analogy is not funny, these are real people I might have to take care of down the road when their problem has gotten worse after receiving BAD info from THIS website. Fighting medical ignorance has been difficult enough with scam artists making their home on the internet targeting the desperate, and the evening news proclaiming "carbs" are bad, no wait now they are good, and telling the public everything causes cancer. Of course the public is confused. THIS forum only makes it worse.\\n\\nI've written to Yahoo Answers about this, but haven't received a reply.
Well, there are a lot of Arabs around Detroit... I think it is the highest percentage of Arabs in the entire US. There are also a lot of African-Americans, Hispanics, and Caucasians throughout the entire state, although there are fewer African-Americans in the Upper Peninsula. In the UP and in the northern part of the LP, there are a lot of Native American reservations, and although there are not a lot of Native Americans the population percentage is relatively high.

First, I'd pay off my debts. All of them. Then I'd pay a few things several months and/or years in advance, because I'd like to avoid being another 20 grand in the hole, if you don't mind. \\nThen I'd buy myself a home and a car, and shoot some cash to my parents for putting up with me & my BS for so many years.\\nNext, maybe I'd seek out some of my friends who need some help.....more morally than monetary, and help them do the same things I'd just done for myself. And set up some college/trust funds for their kids.\\nMaybe I could find some good organizations to donate some money & some time....like Habitat for Humanity or something. Maybe get in the school board's face around here, and tell them I'll do a little something with their budget, but in return they have to step up their curriculum & stop graduating idiots (I heard our schools are like 49th in the nation - HELLO). Maybe I'd travel the country & speak in schools about my lifestyle & where it got me (I'm a bad, bad girl).\\nAnd somewhere in there I'd go do some crazy shopping & spa-type things, with a health club membership b/c I'm fat & lazy & that's gotta go. And put my own self through college to get a few degrees that might be worth something :-)

Good answers so far.  You have to be able to decide who you want to be.  \\n\\nThe "Good Guys" are those that have your best interests at heart, and prove it.  They are those that will help you when you need it, and they are those that you look up to the most.\\n\\nThe "Bad Guys" are those that do the opposite.  They only want what is best for themselves, and will do anything to achieve that goal.\\n\\nAs the other poster said, we all have "good guys" and "bad guys" inside of us.  It's up to us to figure out who we want to be.  We will never always be the "good guy", because there will always be something we want to badly.  We can only try to soften the blow.\\n\\nLiving in a world where you don't know anything, however, does NOTHING but leave you open as a target for the bad guys.

Well I have read all the responses so far and I must say that some are very amusing, but so far only one of these is close.  That is this one:  ( the real answer is at the bottom please read on.)\\n\\nGreen and gold are the national colours of Australia, as proclaimed by Sir Ninian Stephen, the Governor General of Australia on 19 April 1984. The exact colours were specified as being Pantone Matching System numbers 116C and 348C. Green and gold are also the traditional team colours of Australian national sporting teams. Nearly every current Australian national sports teams wears "The Green and Gold", although the hues and proportions of the two colours may vary between teams and across eras. It is widely believed that the colours were chosen because they are the dominant colours of Australia's floral emblem, the Golden Wattle.\\n\\nYou will find that every major Australian national team wears green and gold including most notably the two time world champion Wallabies of Rugby, the Socceroos of the World Cup, and the Olympic team. \\n\\nSource(s):\\n\\nwikipedia.org \\n+++++ \\n\\nReal Answer:\\nThe official colours of Australia are BLUE AND GOLD... (Not Green and Gold, Green and Yellow, or any other colours of the rainbow or anything else that the so called greenies or hippies or even other minority group may wish to conjure up.  If you go to Parliment House and read the constitution ( not that many of obviously have or have the ability to) you will find amongst the small print that the national colours for the reprsentaion of this great land of ours called Australia are Blue and Gold... the reason that we portray Green and Gold is for our sporting teams and that is due to the above mentioned clours of the Wattle flower and tree. \\n\\nNow before you so called experts try to smack me down with all your references and alke I suggest you visit the National Capitol and see the constitution for yourself. Also take the time to read it (if your able to that is  and you will no doubt see that I am correct and you are misinformed..) \\n\\nI hope that this had shed a bit of light on your dilemma or at least given more ammunition for a good arguement as I really do enjoy that..

it isnt gross. in highschool for gym we had to swim and my dumb self didnt wear flip flops and i noticed bout a month later this callous type thing on the bottom of my foot. it kept getting bigger and got to the point where it hurt to walk. well i went to the doctor, and he tried freezing and burning it off  never worked. i am bout 90% sure what u have are what u call planter's warts and they are sooo painful. sadly the only way to get rid of them id to go to the doctor, have the doc numb the area and have him dig it out. planter having to do with plant means they have to cut the root out. i guarentee u after the first day u will have a lil soreness, but after that u will feel better. there will be a small scar, but who looks at the bottom of ur foot and there is a slim to none chance of it coming back. i am 27 yrs old and i had it removed at 17 if that tells u anything. if u nd anymore info email me at genler100@yahoo.com. dont be embarrased. its human life. they do suck and are annoying. hope i could help. if u use messenger and wanna chat genler10 not 100 on mess take care.

my business law teacher in college always told us to think of the "deep pocket" rule, meaning only sue people that have money.  but unless you signed a CONTRACT with your employer, then your employer is not at fault, nor is he/she liable for reinstatement.  find out if your state is an "at will" state as far as employment is concerned.  if it is(as is the case in (i believe) 34 states), then you are screwed. \\n\\nif what you are seeking is REVENGE, then do this:  file a small claims lawsuit against her(costing you b/w $35-$70 to file), but be careful about how you come up with the number you are suing for.  if and ONLY IF you can prove that she lied, then i THINK that you should sue her for 6 months of wages, since that is generally how long it takes to find a job (ie unemployment insurance lasts 6 months).  don't say ANYTHING about defamation of character in small claims court, this area ONLY applies to people in the public eye, ie politicians.  just focus on how HER LIE LED TO YOU LOSING MONEY.  if you can prove that, you will win.\\n\\nwhat happened to you is bullshit, but you can't really DO anything about it other than really just harass the lady.  even if you win in small claims, she won't pay you.  you would have to get a judgement against her, then garnish her wages, etc, which BELIEVE ME is not worth doing.  so if it is revenge you seek, sue her.  if you want money, then find another job and use a friend as a reference for your last job.  if you are pissed off, i've found that throwing eggs is a good outlet for hostility.\\n\\nhope that helps!!!!
If by nature you mean as a person is born, including heredity and genes, I believe this influences human behavior by about 50%.  However, the nurturing a human receives via parents, friends, teachers, and others a person meets and/or sees in life then influence a person's behavior by about 50%.  A person starts out with certain characteristics and learns to deny or appreciate, accept or seek out scenarios which then show that person what he/she enjoys or not.  Life is choices.  So I would need to say "both".
God will not keep them alive in hell. A person who goes to hell will suffer the second death. The second death is an eternal separation from God and  you will be no more.

The speed of light is dependent on the medium in which it is traveling.  Light CAN be slowed down.\\n\\nIn a vacuum, light travels at exactly 299,792,458 m/s.  However, in other medius, like air or glass for example, light will slow down.  The more optically dense the medium , the more it slows down.  We can define a quanity, called the index of refraction (n), which will help us determine the speed of light in a substance.\\nThe higher the index of refraction, the slower light travels.\\n\\nThe velocity at which light propigates (v) is inversely proportional to the index of refraction (n).\\nv = c/n\\nwhere c is the speed of light in a vacuum.\\n\\nIn a perfect vacuum, the index of refraction is exactly 1.  Air has an index of refraction of just slightly above 1, but often, since it is so close, we can just round it off to be 1.  Glass however (depending on the type) can have much higher indexies of refraction, (~1.3 - 1.5 roughly).\\nWhen air moves from lower index of refraction to a higher index of refraction (or vice-versa) it is bent.  This bending of light is due to the fact that the light is slowing down as it enters the medium, which is the case in a prism.\\nDifferent wavelengths of light have different indexies of refraction, all wavelengths do not slow down equally.  This is the reason why blue light is bent more easily than red light and appear at opposite ends of the spectrum.\\n\\nLigh DOES slow down as it enters a more optically dense medium.
i agree with lynda, as far as the clothes dont let the man lust over them, its all good. Loose fitted jeans and shirts do just fine for other men as its very unattractive. You can wear anything for your man when you and him are all alone.
This wasn't my fault, but it was I who got embarrassed....\\nLast night my boyfriend's daughter locked the keys in the car by accident and it was the only set of keys. So we had to wait there until someone brought a metal hanger, and I had to crawl on top of the car and "fish" with the hanger through the sunroof (that wasn't completely open; it was open like 2-3 inches). Everyone in the gas station was laughing their butts off because of me crawling all over the top of the car and then once I got the keys, I almost fell off the car. So at least I gave everyone a good laugh!♥

Your voice sound different to you because you here the voice that resonates in your head, but when it is records and played back you aren't actually speaking so you can hear your voice as it sounds outside of your head (literally).  Therefore everyone hears their own voice different than everyone else hears it.  As for the pictures, yes because we all have a perceived image of ourselves in our minds, when we see that still image, if it differs from the perceived image that we have of ourselves, then it appears funny to us.
here, as the gas is in equilibrium,the pressure exerted by the piston should equal the pressure exerted by the gas..                    Ppiston=mass/area =5g/0.047pa. Use the ideal gas law now..  V=nRT/P and so,area*ht(=V)=nRT/P this implies ht.H=nRT/aP and use your units carefully..i think the answer will be around 203.67502 km

Does it have to be one or the other?  He was gerat in that he had the courage to explore unknown places (educated people of the time did *not* believe they would fall off the edge of the world), and some of his crew were probably people who would otherwise been killed by superstitious oafs, so he was likely responsible for saving lives.  On the other hand, he started the takeover of the "New World" and spread diseases that killed large numbers of the native population.
This is hard to say even now.  I was travelling in China about 10 years ago.  I was in a city near the border where there were a lot of tourists and hence a lot of beggars on the street.\\n\\nThe beggars were mostly children - perhaps 8 to 12 years old.  What made it worse was that they had babies with them - babies that they left lying on the sidewalk until they saw you coming, then picked them up and ran after you asking for money.\\n\\nI never heard one of the babies cry and I still wonder how many of them were already dead and where their supply of them came from.  There would be 2 to 4 children (with their babies) on each street I walked.  I only went out the once; I couldn't take it any more.

haggard has forfeited all credibility and probably won't be in a religious leadership position ever.  There appears to be a Conservative "naughty" trend from foleygate to catholic priests.  There is a lot of hypocrisy in Christianity and that's why i don't subscribe to that religion or any.
Another abnormal thing is India winning nothing in every olympics. This is because India lacks sports culture in general, sports is just not given enough importance. Also add the fact that the whole nation is totally in love with cricket which is faboulously marketed. The Indian FA is just not rich enough for the betterment of the game. One thing i might mention India did get an invitation in 1950 WC in Brazil. But at that time FIFA had introduced the new rule that all players must wear boots. Indian players were not used to it & FA could not afford it also as India had just got her independence in 1947 & was economically unstable. Secondly  we might not be in the WC but we do have world's second largest football stadium in the world Yuva Bharti Krirangan in Kolkata which can sit 150,000 people.

That's the best time to do it!  (In fact, I'm told that persecuted Christians in other countries are actually praying that Americans will begin to face persecution.  They are praying this out of love because they know that in hard times, this is when we lean on God the most).\\nWhen we feel secure in our own ability to handle life, the human instinct is to leave God on a shelf in our own minds.  However, when hard times come, we realize that we are fragile humans in need of a loving, all-powerful God - our Father.  He is always quick to draw near us, just as we would while teaching a young child to walk when it appears that they are about to fall.\\nMy advice: find a quiet place & a good praise CD.  Pop it in, and enter into His presence with thanksgiving in your heart.  Enter His courts with praise.  Once you have entered into a spirit of worship, begin to read the Bible, or you could simply sit quietly, and wait to hear from God.  (Prayer isn't always an act of speaking - the best prayers are often the act of listening).\\nLean on His guidance, and He will direct your paths.  You are NOT alone!  God bless.

Write the words in your question verbatim on a very smart piece of card and pop it in a gold envelope and leave it in her bag, so she opens it on the tube on the way home, or while she's waitin for the bus. Women live for attraction dynamics like this - it's far better than openly admitting anything to her - that should come on the first date during dessert and coffee. Trust me, girls love a flutter of intrigue or mystery in these matters. For an extra twist, spray the card with your cologne! And initial it at the bottom. Good luck t'ya!
She/he means that there are mean that live heterosexual lives date women, but sleep with other men. But they claim they are not gay and wont tell there women that they are sleeping with other men. but they are supposed to be living a "straight" lifestyle.

The United States has a "Triton missle" on a couple nuclear subs, which is capable of destroying all life on the plantet, 3 times over, with a single weapon. \\n\\nBut destroying the actual earth, thats a different story, if we detonated several nuclear weapons in the core of the planet, theres no doubt in my mind that we could destroy it. But on the surface i dont believe its possible, the earth has taken direct hits from comets and asteroids, which both have far more power then any man made weapon, and the earth is still here.

The correct way is to hold the card in your right hand  with the front facing up as if you were going to read it yourself.  Then slide it into the envelope.  The opening will be at the top.  Then when it is opened, the person slides the card out and it is ready to open and read.\\n\\nIf you do it any other way, the card will be backwards or upside down.

This is how I  organize my working days, class time, homework/ study and other obligations.\\n\\n2.I also try to get as much rest as I can because I know what I have to do after the weekend is over (well, I go to school on Saturdays so I really should say when Sundays are over). \\n\\n3.Make sure you have food that is portable -- no fuss and no mess -- eat home cooked meals on the weekend when you have time.\\n\\n4.Make time to workout, trust me, it helps with coping with everyday stress.\\n\\n5. Don't try to be accessible to everyone that wants your time -- make time to have fun with your friends/ family but also know when to draw the line.\\n\\nHope this helps!!! Good luck to you
The answer isn't likely what you'd want to hear.  From the first site listed below, it is apparent that the Jet/DAO components and applications are not supported fully any longer.  That leaves you with a couple of not so good options.\\nFirst, do a file search on the internet and download a few copies.  Make a survey of the file size and get a consensus so that you are fairly sure it isn't a tampered file.  Virus scan it very thoroughly and then install it.  Second option, find and purchase an older copy of a Microsoft programming product that will have the redistributable included on the CD.  This will cost you and you should only use an obviously factory produced CD for the same reasons I advised the gyrations with the downloaded file from option one.  If you do get it and it is critical to your system, be sure and archive it in two or three places and keep the media safe, sound and separate.  The third option is to download the MDAC 2.8 package and hope that it supports enough "deprecated" calls to work with your software.  I hope that this helps you out and wish you luck.

http://www.yamoslair.com/reaper.html\\nhttp://www.ghostnet7.org/grimreaper.html\\nDeath to many is something to fear because its the great unknown, it comes with a sinister stigma or image, many cultures and religions all over the world have ways of coping with the one thing all men and women will one day have to stand face to face with, the greatest of unknowns "Death". \\n\\nThe fact is that we are ALL going to have to take the plunge of death. Through out time human kind has delved into the deepest and darkest places in there minds and imaginations to try and find an answer to death, or to give it a face and to better understand that dark and frightening thing that we all put to the back of our minds, but know that one day we will all have to take the plunge into that dark unknown. \\n\\nTo many death is a dark and sinister and unforgiving and unrelenting shadow, so you can probably see how the modern idea and image of what the grim reaper or death looks like comes from, its a dark figure holding a scythe, dressed in a black hooded robe, with a skull for a head. How did this image come about, and is there really a ghostly figure called death ready to introduce him self to us when our flame has eventually been extinguished ? \\n\\nThe image of death or of The Grim Reaper probably comes from human kinds fear of dyeing, many people want to live forever and the fact that they know they cant live forever has caused them to give a face to that nasty obstacle that stops them from being able to stay alive for good, so of course the picture that is going to be painted by a death fearing society is going to be that of a scary and mysterious one. \\n\\nThe reaper is seen to be carrying a scythe, the idea of this comes from the idea that when death comes to us he’s coming to chop down the living and to sever the soul from the body. The scythe is used for chopping down crops so the image of the grim reaper and his scythe would indicate that its seen as death coming and "reaping his harvest" his crops being the souls of the just departed. \\n\\nThe Reaper is not just seen as a figure to meet at ones own death, but its also seen as a warning to the living, that if they dont change there ways then "death" is just around the corner, so he can be seen in a positive light too. \\n\\nMany people who claimed to have been visited by The Reaper say that he was totally silent and did nothing except pull out an old watch on a chain or an hour glass and is said to gently tap on it like the seconds ticking away all the while not saying a word, but even though he says nothing the message is clear to the person seeing it. His skull like face probably comes from the skull symbolising death myth, so it would make sense that people would see the reapers face as a skull. \\n\\nMany people might see The Reaper as the sinister man in a black robe because that is how they view death, so the reaper will probably show him self to each person how that person views death personally, if someone longed for death or did not look at death as something to fear I can imagine then death would probably show them selves to them people as something more pleasant looking. Death is what we want him (or it) to be. \\n\\nThe image of the grim reaper in a long robe comes from the garb of Death or the black mourning robe first seen in the 1500s, in them times a monk would stand over the dyeing persons bed, so again the images of things people have seen surrounding death have been associated with how people view The Grim Reaper, which is why he looks a little like a monk dressed in a abbot. \\n\\nThe belief in The Grim Reaper probably goes back to ancient times. In Greek mythology you have the god Chronos or Cronus also know as "Father time" who could also be seen carrying a scythe and his saying was "nothing lasts forever - except time(death)". The word ‘corone’ to the Greeks (translated to English) means crow, so its no wonder that the crow i

Stars twinkle because of turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere. You can think as the atmosphere being made up of several "layers." Each layer has a different temperature and density. As the light from a star passes through the atmosphere, it is bent by each layer, and we perceive the twinkling. \\n\\nThe bending of the light when it passes from one medium to another, like water to air, or one layer of air to another, is called refraction. Refraction is what makes a straw look bent when you put it in a glass of water. Refraction also makes the stars and the Sun near the horizon look higher in the sky than they really are. In fact, when the Sun is setting, we are seeing the sun's disk when the Sun is already below the horizon!\\n\\nhttp://www.mira.org/fts0/stars/text/txt001c.htm

You should jog at a comfortable pace (you should be able to say a sentence semi-comfortably) for more than twenty minutes. Slow down if you need to. Stop if you have any chest pain. \\n\\nThe first 5 minutes or so are more of a warm-up: go a little slower at first, then increase your speed. Also, cool-down after your 20 minutes are up (start with a power walk and wind down to a good "mall pace"). Don't forget to stretch before and after a workout- it will make your workout more productive. \\n\\nAs for the workout itself, for the first 20 minutes, you're getting cardio benefits (aerobic exercise). After 20 minutes, you're in anaerobic exercise...you're no longer burning fat, but building muscle. Muscle will increase your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), which will increase the caloric need of your body...so it helps you to lose even more weight!\\n\\nAs for treadmills v. outside: it's a matter of person preference: \\nTreadmills:\\n   Advantages: help you keep up your pace, can vary terrain/incline to your preference, can see the calories you're burning \\n   Disadvantage: sometimes it can be more difficult to breathe indoors\\nOutside: \\n   Advantages: ever-changing scenery, cleaner air \\n   Disadvantage:less control over terrain/incline\\n\\n\\nEnergy requirements depend on the speed, duration, and incline of your workout, as well as your current health status.

Then repeat pouring into glass number two! ;-D  Ask them to pick which glass has the most water!!! Hee, Hee. It so fun, most times they pick the Tall narrow glass because, well, it look like MORE!! Ha!!! Then you can explain Measurement Concept using the measuring cup, show them it the Exact same! BUT, because the glasses are shaped Different, one look like it have more! Hope you understand what I saying. Then you can work from here to TEACH the importance of using different measuring Devices to Really know what is correct!! It a blast! Just be Patience, as, it can take time for Children to see this Concept.\\nIK has a good one with the Candy Bar. What I do is a one-on-one here, so fun, you take a candy bar and say you going to half it with a Child. Then Break it uneven (3/4-1/4) and measure the two pieces side by side so the child see one is bigger!!! Then you keep the big one and give the smaller to the Child, hopefully he/she will respond yours bigger! Then you say sorry and put the two pieces back together, so child sees, and Bite them off even eating that part, then you say; "there, now it even", and hand them a piece!!! It is GREAT!!!!! Then you can use a Ruler to show how this could have been done Fair!\\nHEY!!!! Better add this, IF, you do the candy bar, be sure you know what candy a child can have. As, in, Dibetic etc. AND, be prepared to gain a little weight! ;-p AND, have a whole candy for them to take home, then, they not feel cheated!
people dont want to admit theyre sinful and that they are doing wrong\\nto admit that Jesus is your savior means that you are admitting that you are living your life in sin, and that you need to be saved.  it is natural for people to sin, and to leave your sinful ways is very difficult.  many people would rather choose to ignore it and pass it off as fiction so they will not feel grievance

Edema is an observable swelling from fluid accumulation in certain body tissues. Edema most commonly occurs in the feet and legs, where it also is referred to as peripheral edema.

HERE ARE MY TOP THREE:\\n\\n(1)Laugh as often as possible. ~\\nLaughter releases endorphins, the body's natural pain killers. Laughter lowers blood pressure, reduces stress hormones and boosts your immune function.\\n\\n(2)You need a friend. ~\\nFriendship is not a luxury, but is essential to work-life balance and your health. Studies show isolation decreases immune functioning.\\n\\n(3) Maintain an attitude of gratitude. ~\\nIt's impossible to be grateful and experience stress at the same time. Studies tell us daily gratitude exercises result in higher levels of alertness, enthusiasm, determination, optimism and energy.

The speed of a computer depends on various factors. RAM and the Processor are examples of hardwares which determine the computer speed. Other factors are software related factors such as Presence of Anti virus and Anti spyware etc decreases speed, Full harddisc decreases the speed, Presence of large hard disc partitions also decreases speed.\\nFor increasing your computer's speed you can add some more RAM to your system. You can make smaller hard disc partitions. In addition to this regular use of disc defragmenter and disc cleanup also  increases speed to some extent.

I probably sound like a broken record when I say that going to university and getting a tertiary education gives you more job opportunities and also prepares you for the workforce (in terms of meeting deadlines, being able to "find" answers, learning how to learn). A lot of businesses look at your education record as a sign as whether you'll be a good worker or not. Some require certain qualifications before you can even apply. It was also a family expectation for me to go into university.\\n\\nMy education goals is to continually learn. It may not be formally, but I dont' think the learning process should ever stop. I do also wish to try to improve the education system in Australia by recognising good teachers and providing a good network/resource avenue for them.
That depends on what rate you're paying on your student loan.   If you're loan payment is higher than the 5-5.5% you can get from the bank or CD, then you're losing money on the spread.  In other words, the loan is costing you money.   On the other hand, if you had your money invested in something that gave you an average annual return that exceeded the loan rate, then I would advocate keeping the loan because you're making money on the spread.\\n\\nThe other issue is whether your student loan is fixed or adjustable.   Student loan rates will be going up about 1.5% in the next few months.   If that affects you then it may be even more motivation to go ahead and pay it off.   Ultimately, you just have to decide if you can invest the money for more than the loan payment with a reasonable low risk (based on what you're saying your risk factors are) because if not, then paying on the loan while you make less from the bank doesn't make sense.
I don't think there are any good shortcuts. If you are going to go vegan all the way, you might want to try your local health-food store and look for "vegan" in the label. You may also find websites if you google the same word. The bottom-line is you will still need to read a lot of labels and slowly learn what products come from animals (lactose and things like that). Try sticking to organic vegetables, tofu, and fresh foods in general to save some time at the grocery store (but not necessarily in the kitchen). Another good meat substitute is seitan (it makes a killer stroganoff). Look for fast-meal vegan cookbooks online. There is a world of information out there. \\nJust make sure you are still eating enough vegetable proteins. Try beans, tofu, seitan, mushrooms, soy, nuts, etc. (again, google things like "high protein content" or look for nutritional listings online). Good luck!\\nObs.: You might want to put your posting under a subject like diet, health, cooking, or something like that. \\n\\nP.S.: I just found that there is a whole section of yahoo! questions dedicated to the subject. Under "food and drink" there is a sub-section called "vegetarian and vegan". There are a lot of questions there similar to yours. Check it out!
I have read it and enjoyed it. It really brought out the attitudes and historical elements of the south in the war.\\n\\nThis historical novel set in the Civil War era was first published in 1993 and is based on the extraordinary experience of one family in the South. The Civil War began with shots fired at Will McLean's house at Manassas and—by an amazing quirk of fate—ended with General Lee discussing surrender in the Appomattox house where McClean had moved his family to escape the war. Through the eyes of the narrator, Oscie Mason, readers can explore the impact of historical events on one family from 1852—when Will McLean becomes Oscie's new stepfather—to the end of the war.

Yes, I have.  I was bitten on the leg.  It's pretty bad stuff.  It starts rotting the skin in and around the bite itself.  Swells up really huge, like a boil.  The longer you wait to go to the doctor the worse it si on you.  Considering your friend was bit on his buttocks, he had better get on in to the doctor.  They will lance it and put you on antibiotics.  Seek medical attention!!

Most honest lenders consider a score under 500 to be an unacceptable credit risk.  Your first goal should be to get your credit score up, not get yourself into more debt.

If you want a national plan (in the event you do a significant amount of travel) then you might want to use Blue Cross or Medica.  I would suggest looking at a plan that has a deductible that is at least $1,500 for a single person or $3,000 for a family.  This will keep the premium costs lower and also qualify you for contributions into an HSA (Health Savings Account).  These contributions are pre-tax and can be withdrawn and used tax free for qualified medical expenses.  \\nThis type of strategy saves you premium costs and taxes.  If you or a family member who will be on the plan has a large amount of health care expenses per year, you might do better to consider a lower deductible.  The increased premiums might be less expensive than the out of pocket expenses if you are more likely to use more services or ongoing prescription medications that are expensive.

The Meisenberg Universitat ran a 15 year program on 7500 pregnant women and their babies between 1957 and 1972 (using findings reported by Dr. Joseph Mengela from his experiments at the Oswieczim Klinische in 1944-45).  The chief physicians involved were Drs. Heinrich Schimmelmann (a clinical obstetrician), Gertruda Greundfeld (a clinical psychologist) and Magda Zhitanska (a clinical pediatrician and para psychologist).  The team was headed by Dr. Mikhail Ivanovich Strovankiev (psychiatrist and mathematician) until he retired in 1964 and was replaced by Dr. Gunther Romanovich (psychiatric pediatrician).\\n\\nThey concluded  from their experiments that the children exposed to Bach and Mozart for at least 5 continuous hours twice weekly during the third trimester of pregnancy and the first 2 years of life were about 25% faster in learning mathematics at the ages of 7 - 14.  Because the study ended, there was apparently no follow-up to determine whether or not the trend continued at later ages.   \\n \\nThose children likewise exposed to Italian opera were on par with the children not exposed to music at all, while the children exposed to Blues, Jazz and Bavarian folk music were about 10% ahead on the learning curve.  Rock and Roll resulted in about a 5% decline in math skills, but a 15% increase in language abilities, both in German and foreign languages.\\n\\nSchimmelmann, Greunfeld and Zhitansku postulated that the increased mathematical skills derives from the meticulous mathematical construct of Bach and Mozart,  while the more whimsical lyrical quality of the Italian operas did not engender the mathematical focus of the German selections.  (This may be a conclusion based  more on  propaganda than actual scientific results.)  They also attributed the increased math learning by the children exposed to Blues, Jazz and Bavarian Folk music on the less intricate but inherent mathematical foundation of these forms of music, while concluding that the less mathematical but more free-flowing and innovative rhythms in Rock enhanced the artistic and  imaginative characteristics of subjects, making them receptive to understanding language better, but less able to work problems in math and logic.\\n\\nThe experiment was a joint effort sponsored by the East German and Soviet governments, in conjunction with related research into para psychological phenomena.  The para psychological components of the study have been largely ignored, but the study did report increased psychic abilities in the children exposed to Rock, which follows from the conclusions reached as mentioned above.\\n\\nThe study was reported in the July 19, 1976, edition of Pravda and mentioned in the January 24, 1977, edition of Die Zeitung.  It was  largely discounted by the Western scientific community at the time.  To my knowledge, the actual study has never been published in the West and Western criticism was without benefit of reviewing the research.\\n\\nI became aware of the study while enrolled at Julliard in 1978, but was unable to procure a copy of the study beyond that reported in Pravda and Die Zeitung.  I was so intrigued by the articles that I have retained my notes on them, but unfortunately cannot locate the actual articles.  Sorry. \\n\\nIf you find anything further on the study, particularly about any follow-up study which may have been done, please post it here.  I had forgotten about the whole affair until reading your question.

I live in the South, and I love it, but I don't think all the people from the North feel the same way.\\nIf you grew up here and don't know what to think, what makes you think others that have not necessarily grew up here would know what to think?
In short:  Protein is what your body is made of.  Carbohydrate is the main fuel that keeps it going.\\n\\nTo keep the car analogy going:  Protein is like the fiberglass, plastic and rubber in your car.  Carbohydrate is the gasoline (Fat is another major fuel source for the body).\\n\\nProteins are VERY complex.  They are the most complex chemical substances in the universe (that we know of).  They are massive molecules made of thousands of atoms all linked together to form atomic loops and chains and blobs.  These special shapes give the protein its special characteristics.  That's why one rigid protein called KERATIN forms the hair and fingernails of many animals including humans, while another goopy protein called COLLAGEN helps to keep your skin flexible.\\n\\nAll proteins are made of the same 20 building blocks called amino acids.  Just like the same 26 letters can spell out 50,000 different English words, these same 20 amino acids an spell out all of the different proteins required for life on earth.\\n\\nCARBOHYDRATE is a fancy made-up Greek word for all the various forms of SUGAR.\\n\\nTable sugar is a chemical called SUCROSE, while apples taste sweet because of FRUCTOSE and GLUCOSE.  Milk tastes good because of LACTOSE.  These are all carbohydrates:  Forms of sugar.\\n\\nSugar can take other unexpected forms also:  The stuff that makes wood tough is not a protein but actually a carbohydrate called CELLULOSE.  Don't worry, cellulose won't make you fat, because humans can't digest it.  Yes, carrots have cellulose, but that part of the carrot goes right through you.\\n\\nBut we love potatoes, which are essentially the stored sugar of a hardy plant that miraculously grew in Ireland and the Baltic region.  Potatoes don't taste sweet because the carbohydrate that makes up potatoes is STARCH, a complex carbohydrate.\\n\\nYour body CAN burn protein as fuel.  But, protein is very inefficient and your body is programmed to do this only if there are no sugar or fats available.  When your body starts burning protein for fuel, it starts with the major muscles, tearing them down for fuel like the crew of a ship wrecked in the arctic might start burning the planks of the vessel for warmth.\\n\\nThis is why starving people begin to have a "living skeleton" appearance (except for the distended belly, which is the result of another chemical process).\\n\\nMoral of the story:  In spite of what athletes and health nuts tell you, you cannot live off just protein or fiber.\\n\\nYou crave fat and sugar because your body favors those fuels.  If your car had a brain and had to find its own fuel, it would crave gasoline just like you crave burgers and donuts.\\n\\nOf course, we have more fat and sugar around than our ancestors could possibly imagine.  Our ancestors also got plenty of exercise, with all the hunting and skinning and chopping and chipping and the warfare.\\n\\nSince our bodies were designed for the hunter-gatherer lifestyle, and were not designed to sit behind a desk or on a couch eating insane amounts of sugar and fat -- we get sick from doing what feels right.

There are ways to speed up audio content, but you need sophisticated software to do so. At least speed it up and maintain the pitch, that is.  I use Digital Performer. It is an amazing audio recording program that does everything, including time shifting audio. I have not tried to import a .wma file, but I think it might do that. Post the file somewhere and I'll give it a try. BTW, why do you want to double speed it?

Probably 95% of AIM users are there by default - they signed up for internet via AOL, and AOL pushes its OWN programs almost as bad as Microsoft does theirs.\\n\\nI'd speculate that 60%?? of MSN users use MSN simply because it comes with Windows.\\n\\nThose with enough gumption to get out and actually SEARCH for an IM program, and perhaps COMPARE different ones, probably usually end up with YahooMessenger - the BEST in my view. \\n(Maybe 5-10% of YM users are there due to SBCGlobal/Yahoo signup - others, by CHOICE).\\n\\nBut.... perhaps ONE good reason to use AIM might be simply if all your friends are on AIM - though you can still go to something like www.trillian.cc or Gaim which can access most IM programs including AIM all at once.

An enterovaginal fistula is a hole in the wall between your rectum and your vagina, so that feces can enter your vagina. Cancer in the pelvic region and long difficult labour can cause this. A fistula, meaning opening between two areas that should not have it, can also occur between your urinary bladder and vagina, so you leak urine into your vagina. Or it can occur between your bladder and rectum so you can get feces into your urine. A fistula is not part of a persons normal anatomy. The word entero in enterovaginal fistula, means something to do with you gut basically. I am a Physician.

Under the first slider bar, labled "volume", make sure the "Mute All" box is NOT checked.  Slide the volume bar up about half way. Do the same thing for the next section labled "Wave", and the one marked "CD Player". Then close it down; if you have a sound card in your computer, then volume will work.

Sure, just look at a frozen lake - you can usually see frozen bubbles in there.  The top layer of water almost always freezes first. Any air in the water (or released into the water) naturally rises and is trapped under the top frozen layer.  When the water under the top layer freezes, you have frozen bubbles.  Look in your ice cube tray - you might just find some frozen bubbles there!

I am not sure what your question is but here is some information on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA): \\n \\nData Envelopment Analysis (DEA). A nonparametric method in operations research and econometrics for multivariate frontier estimation and ranking.\\n\\nWith the intention of being consistent with microeconomic production theory and when being conscious of the existence of inefficiencies in the production processes, frontier techniques have been developed during the last 30 years.\\n\\nAmong the different solutions, we can find a nonparametric method called Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which is a linear programming methodology to measure the efficiency of multiple Decision Maker Units (DMUs) when the production process presents a structure of multiple inputs and outputs.\\n\\nThen, some of the benefits of it are: (1) there is no need to explicitly specify a mathematical form for the production function, (2) it has proven to be useful in uncovering relationships that remain hidden for other methodologies, (3) is capable of handling multiple inputs and outputs, (4) it can be used with any input-output measurement, (5) the sources of inefficiency can be analysed and quantified for every evaluated unit.

A virtual school sound interesting. Most likely the classes will be made for your needs.
When you wrap a coil of wire around an iron bar and pass an electrical current through the bar, you create an electromagnet that is capable of temporarily aligning the iron atoms in the bar.  Perhaps all the atoms are aligned a little.  By increasing the current or adding additional turns to the coil or both the strength (flux) of the electromagnet can be increased and the alignment of iron atoms also increased until saturation when maximum strength is obtained.  Rather than increasing penetration, this is likely more like increasing strength at depth (penetration).

The Knock Knock joke , or gnoona gnoona joke as it was originally called , was devised by Henndrick Driedler , a successful first world war stand-up comedian . It is said that he invented the joke whilst trying to return to his deaf landlady's lodgings . Each time he knocked on the door , the landlady would ask who was there , he would say Herr Driedler , at one point after she thought he had said Hair Dryer he realized the potential humor in the situation and sat outside writing down other jokes until the end of the war .\\n'why did the chicken cross the road' is credited to an Irishman - Seamus O'Reilly who actually carried out scientific experiments to find out why his chicken crossed the road - after three hard years he concluded that it was indeed to get to the other side . However, at his lecture on the subject ( Birmingham 1897 ) his peers fell about laughing and so , after much deep thought , he re-invented his paper as a joke , which has become the classic we all know and love . His descendants live a life of luxury , living off the royalties of this single joke .

Don't cut it off... Like the other 2 guys before me said you might try stretching it... I am uncircumcised and I have stretched it a little bit yeah it hurts a little so I would suggest try inserting 2 fingers if you can try slowly spreading you fingers... I know of this one guy no kidding... fit eight fingers in there he told me he started with 4 fingers. But if stretching doesn't work for you you might want to get circumcised (sex should be enjoyable).

I read this book called the Five Love Languages by Gary Chapman. I talks about the five different ways people express love to each other. The ones I can remember, are Time, Gifts, Words. The last two I can't remember. I know that I usually express my love by giving people gifts, it's just natural for me, If I like somebody, I give them something. For others, what they say matters more than what they give, or for others thier time is more valuable than words or gifts. So look for the way that your loved ones see love expressed and try to show it to them in that way.
31 for your CO2 isn't too much over the range.  When CO2 levels are higher or lower than normal, it suggests that your body is having trouble maintaining its acid-base balance or that you have upset your electrolyte balance, perhaps by losing or retaining fluid. Both of these imbalances may be due to a wide range of dysfunctions. Your SGPT level could be high if you have liver damage from an acute viral infection such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C, or \\nyou have liver damage caused by medicines you have taken. Other reasons could be drinking too much alcohol, mononucleosis, chronic liver infection or inflammation, gallbladder inflammation, such as may caused by gallstones, gallbladder infection, congested blood flow through the liver due to heart failure, liver cancer or another cancer that has spread to the liver, or you are taking certain medicines, such as: \\nmedicines used to lower cholesterol levels \\nantifungal medicines \\nsome narcotics and barbiturates \\nmethotrexate \\nacetaminophen \\nsalicylates (aspirin). \\nYour doctor will probably do further testing to determine what the exact cause may be.

Make sure you've been under a warm shower or bath for a while.  Apply shower gel or shaving cream.  First shave in the direction of the hair growth (not much hair goes, this is ok).  Then shave against the direction of the hair growth.  Follow with cool water AND lotion.\\n\\nI have very sensitive skin, I live in a warm climate, so I am in shorts or a bathing suit about 9 months out of the year.  No bumps and my skin stays smooth as silk.

High Cascade Snowboard Camp V Windell's, the rivalry of the ages.  Well, personally I am a fan of MHSSC, Mount Hood Summer Ski Camp, however my friend, who competed in Oregon at the Paul Mitchell Progression Session and took first place in the nation, Tim Humphrey's has told me that both the on hill and off hill training at Windell's is far superior to that of HCSC.  I would have to say that being biased towards neither of those, I would have to say also that Windells has a far better name, and the coaching staff is much more renown than that of HCSC.  If you want to look into another camp though, MHSSC is the way to go man!
they both suck.
1960s The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) provide numerous contributions to medicine. Examples not only included the observation and documentation of metabolic and physiological stress but inventions like telemetry, Teflon, titanium, freeze-drying, microwave, fiberoptics, advances in computerization etc. \\n\\n1960s Dr. Richard Dyer pioneers a renewed interest in intraoperative autotransfusion leading to the development of the first commercial auto-transfusion apparatus. \\n\\n1960s American physiologist Judith Pool discovered that slowly thawed frozen plasma yielded deposits high in Factor VIII. The deposits called cryoprecipitates are further refined. \\n\\n1960s Vaccine against hepatitis.1960s Issac Harary, UCLA laboratory biochemist discovered the "automaticity" of heart cells leading to investigations at the cellular level. \\n\\n1960 Medtronic develops the first fully implantable pacemaker. \\n\\n1960 Dr. Albert Starr, Oregon surgeon develops the Starr- Edwards heart valve. One of the most successful heart valves produced until the late 1970s. \\n\\n1961 Dr. R.L. Swank, University of Oregon Health Sciences Center observed that the microviscosity of stored blood was significantly greater than that of fresh blood leading to the discovery and filtration theory of microaggregates. \\n\\n1961 Callaghan, developed an artificial placenta for extracorporeal support of newborns with RDS. \\n\\n1962 Moulopoulos et. al. suggested the use of a single chambered intra-aortic balloon, positioned in the descending thoracic aorta, to accomplish the same hemodynamics as did arterial counterpulsation. \\n\\n1964 Dotter and Judkins used tapered Teflon dilating catheters during arteriography to dilate occluded peripheral arteries. \\n\\n1964 Bretschneider introduces cold cardioplegia. \\n\\n1965 Raskkind, developed a low volume disposable pumpless bubble oxygenator for use as a substitute lung on children with cystic fibrosis, RDS, and CHD. \\n\\n1966 Tchobroutsky, long term support of puppies and fetal lambs in a controlled environment using extracorporeal circulation. \\n\\n1967 Rene Favaloro, an Argentine surgeon working in the United States performs the first coronary bypass operation using the patient's native saphenous vein as an autograft. \\n\\n1967 December 3, South African heart surgeon Dr. Christian Neethling Barnard performs the first heart transplant at Groote Schur Hospital in Capetown. This was shortly after touring the United States and observing Dr. Norman Schumway's nine year study with animal heart transplantation and rejection methods. \\n\\n1968 Kantrowitz et. al., the first clinical trial in man of intra-aortic balloon pumping. \\n\\n1968 Kolobow and Zapol, partial extracorporeal gas-exchange in alert newborn lambs with a membrane artificial lung, perfused via an A-V shunt for periods up to 96 hours. \\n\\n1969 Dr. Denton Cooley, Texas Heart Institute, Houston, Texas, implanted a total artificial heart designed by Domingo Liotta. The device served as a "bridge" for cardiac transplantation until a donor heart was found, 64 hours. The cardiac transplant functioned for an additional 32 hours until the patient died of pneumonia. \\n\\n1969 Zapol and Kolobow, "artificial placentation." Prematurely delivered fetal lambs connected to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenator by umbilical cord, and placed in a tank of artificial amniotic fluid. \\n\\n1969 Dorson, long-term partial bypass support of a 1.6 Kg. premature infant with RDS for 20 hours.
Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is any sudden and unexplained death of an apparently healthy infant aged one month to one year.\\n\\nSIDS is a definition of exclusion and should only apply to an infant whose death is sudden and unexpected, and remains unexplained after the performance of an adequate postmortem investigation including (1) an autopsy, (2) investigation of the scene and circumstances of the death and (3) exploration of the medical history of the infant and family. Generally, but not always, the infant is found dead after having been put to sleep and exhibits no signs of having suffered. Some researchers want SIDS to be assigned only to infants of age between one month and one year because of the likely high rate of false positive diagnoses in the neonatal cases when congenital anomalies are difficult to find at autopsy and the rarity of cases after one year.\\n\\nSIDS is responsible for roughly 50 deaths per 100,000 births in the US. It is responsible for far fewer deaths than congenital disorders and disorders related to short gestation; though it becomes the leading cause of death in otherwise healthy babies after one month of age.

Women's clothing isn't measured the way men's clothing is measured. Frustrating but true. Ask any woman who wears a size 8 in Gloria Vanderbilt jeans but a size 10 or 12 in another brand. That's why women have to spend so much time trying on their clothes. Men can buy a size "38 long" jacket and know it will fit because men's sizes are measured in inches. For women's clothing, it's all arbitrary from one brand to another... or even within the same brand. So there is no correct answer to your question.
If you mean "cariño" it means "affection".

The question is about withholding, not tax liability, and the answer depends on the state you're in.  If you are not a non-resident alien, the Federal government with not withhold any taxes, regardless of how long you lived in the property.  State withholding varies from state to state. Here in CA, if you don't have an exemptable reason  3 1/3% of the SALE PRICE of the property will be withheld.

It relates to the polarity of the ligands in question.  Peptide hormones are normally charged (that is their R substituent groups have polar atoms or groups) whereas steroid hormones are nonpolar molecules.  The phospholipid membrane of a cell is permeable only to nonpolar molecules such as steroid hormones and it acts to keep the peptide hormones out because of their charge.  For this reason, the cell has developed surface receptors located outside of the cell for peptide hormones and cystolic receptors for the steroid hormones that have direct access into the cell.

Dont use it as it allows to much rubbish to pass onto my system. Try another Browser. I personally use Opera as it doesnt use Active X controls which allows stuff to run on your PC. Although Yahoo says you have to purchase it. It is still free to download and use. See links below to find out the best one for you. Or you can still stay with your browser. Personally I have never had a problem with Opera thats why it gets my vote I hate having to sort out problems that effect my surfing.

If you are looking to start over and you have the financial flexibility, consider taking out a student loan and going back to school. That will give you some time to get on your feet, and it can be much easier to transition into a new field if you have some defined credentials.\\n\\nAlternatively, if you are willing to take risks and have a good idea, this might be a good time to start a new business.\\n\\nThere are lots of good fields to enter, anything from nursing to computer programming to molecular biology. Mostly, it depends on what you like to do and what you are good at.\\n\\nSpend some time thinking about what you wish you could spend your time doing. Is it working with people? Analyzing data? Working with your hands? Writing? Traveling? As long as it's not "sitting around watching TV" or something (and really, most of us would get bored pretty quickly with that), there should be a number of potential careers that allow you to do that.\\n\\nMost importantly, no career, no matter how lucrative, is the right career for you if you don't enjoy doing it.

I hope it does because women sports is the real thing they actuall play the game in guys sports they gotta act like babies and complain when a foul is made and do a lotta stupid fighting although i like the fights! it gets a little recognition but not as much as it deseves, the only reason guy sports are popular is because they are stupid and bring a lotta drama to the game, to me women sports is the real thing and they play the game that's why guys don't want to watch it cause they think they rule the world of sports and they think that it should be filled with stupid stuff!

As far as land and property goes, in the "old days" you simply staked out a claim.  In present time, you actually have to purchase the land you live on and hold a title to that land.  Without a title of ownership, anyone can take it from you.  It's like finders keepers.  If I take something from you and you cannot prove that it was yours with documentation or present some sort of proof in court that you possessed it or I stole it, it's mine and there is nothing you can do about it. Drop $100 bill on the street and see if you can get it back from the person who picks it up.\\n\\nAs far as rights and the constitution.  You do not have to claim the rights of the country you were born in.  If you are born in the United States you recieve a birth certificate and the government documents your existance with a Social Security number.  If you have these thing, you automatically recieve the rights granted to you under the constition.

Religion simply serves to validate homophobic feelings that will naturally arise, especially in men, in a patriarchal, macho society. In general, people find the sexually "deviant" acts of other people disgusting, although they have no problem with the ones they themselves engage in. For example, although both oral and anal sex would be considered deviant according to the Bible, most conservative Christian males only have a problem with the idea of anal sex because it implies male on male sex, which disgusts them personally because they're not attracted to men. But the idea of oral sex performed on a woman doesn't bother them. And in fact, some of them even engage in anal sex themselves, with women of course, but have no problem criticizing homosexuals who do the same. It's basically a double standard based on personal preferences and rationalized using religion as an excuse.\\n\\nAnother way you can tell it's a hypocritical double standard is to look closely at the verses in which the Bible appears to forbid sodomy and compare them to verses forbidding other things. For example, although sodomy appears to be forbidden only in the Old Testament, and is usually only mentioned in the context of another string of perversions as if sodomy alone were not the true problem, divorce and remarriage are forbidden not only in the Old Testament but in the New Testament as well. Jesus expressly forbids the separation of two people who have been brought together in marriage in God's name, but he says nothing whatsoever about homosexuality. Furthermore, if you look at the book in which the majority of the verses supposedly aimed against sodomy appear, Leviticus, you'll notice that it comes down equally as hard on a number of other behaviors which we have not vilified, including talking back to your parents. Therefore it's obvious that religious scripture is not the source of homophobia. The true source is a double standard born of personal preference and intolerance and rationalized by selective reading of religious scripture.

The pressure inside each enclosed bubble will remain the same.  If the airline is pressurized, there's no effect (usually cargo planes are pressurized, except in extreme cases).  Physics dictates that the bubble would "appear" to EXPAND in the increasing altitude due to lower pressure outside/inside the plane; therefore if you are concerned about shipping something via altitude w/o pressurized cabin--- no worries.  It would take a trip outside of earth's atmosphere to pop... if no cabin pressurization.  Don't take it out scuba diving; water depth increases pressure exponentially, and would collapse them.

I live just over 100 miles from the border and I have been thinking about that for a few years now. Ever since the NAFTA agreement opened the border to truck traffic from Mexico.\\nThey do not inspect the incoming containers like we do. So a terrorist group could load a container with anything and ship it to Mexico to be transferred to a truck that is going to somewhere in the states and just drive it across the border in San Diego or Texas. Then in just a few days it could be sitting right in-front of the Washington monument and pull the trigger on some big bomb Boom Boom Washington DC.

So do you want to have strong abs, or visable abs? \\n\\nRemember, that everyone has abs. But, everyone also has a layer of fat over them, some more than others. You need to enforce a low fat diet for them to be visable to the eye. Keep up with the situps, pushups, flutter kicks, leg lifts, etc and get on the low fat diet and you'll eventually see them.\\n\\nDon't get discouraged though; your abs are some of the hardest muscles to make visable to most people. Just keep working at it.
"Secure borders" is a fantasy, just like the "war on drugs" and the "war on terror".  Politicians talk about it in the hope that people believe the government is doing something about it.  It is an insane and mistaken proposition that you can somehow defend against the action of a single determined individual.  Yet the government keeps pouring our tax dollars into a big black hole all the while telling us to trust them.  I don't think so.\\n\\nYou can't be free and at the same time have the ability to stop an individual from doing something they want to do.  It doesn't matter whether it's crossing a border, taking drugs, or committing an act of terror.  We can't even stop Americans from robbing, terrorizing, and killing each other, let alone prevent it on a global scale.  If we give up rights and freedoms in order to be "secure" then what have we accomplished?\\n\\nAs a country, we are now in the process of repeating the same mistakes made by past nations/civilizations.  Those who advocate building walls, profiling, and other such measures in the name of security should take some time to review their history.  There is no fortress that can't be overcome and a "fortress America" would be no different.  If you believe that history won't repeat itself and the fate of the US will be different, you're only fooling yourself.\\n\\nDon't buy the jingoism and the macho statements of the day like "we need to fight them over there so we don't have to fight them over here" or "they hate us for our freedoms".  Those are meaningless statements.  The government has failed the American people and the people of many other nations because it fails to walk the talk.  And because those making US foreign policy have almost always resorted to flexing their muscle, rather than working toward a win-win solution in the best interests of the American people and other affected nations.  We are now paying dearly for such a short-sighted approach.\\n\\nTo be secure, we need to address the root cause of problems.  Treating symptoms is almost always more costly in the long run and it just doesn't work.  Unresolved problems may go away for awhile, or they may fester, but they always come back and sometimes worse than before.  Tolerance for others along with fairness, and integrity in all of our dealings with others would go a long way toward creating a more peaceful and secure world.  Peace.

If you want to study it in college, begin looking at those that offer the program.  Then contact someone in the department to find out more specific information about the program such as requirements for graduating, what projects they are working on, how involved they are in the community, and who the professors are.  Make sure you that you keep in mind what YOUR interests are.  For example, don't choose a university that focuses on southwestern archaeology if you would rather study underwater archaeology.\\n\\nOnce you find a program you like and are accepted, get involoved in the depratment.  Get to know the professors and staff members. This will give you more opportunities for field experience or internships.  You will go alot further in the field if you know people than if you only attend class.  In archaeology, its who you know that really takes you places. It doesn't take long for us to realize who is really going to make it in the field.\\n\\nIf you are purely just interested in it, there are many books out there on the subject, some excellent and some fiction.  Make sure you choose something that was written by a archaeologist working at the academic level or a respected agency.  If you don't you may end up with something about divination.  Also, Archaeology Magazine is an excellent source about what going on in the field right now.  You may also be interested in joining the AIA (Archaeology Institute of America).  It has chapters all over the country which usually hold field trips and monthly lectures.\\n\\nWhat you do not want to do is play Indiana Jones and just start digging things up on your own.  Through education you will be taught the proper techniques and guidelines for excavation so the data you collect will be useful.  As soon as you dig something up, you will lose its context and any information it can give about the past.  Proper education will teach you how to save this information.\\n\\nSo, when it comes to Archaeology stay up to date, stay involved, and always be willing to learn something new!  \\n\\nIts an amazing field to be involved in and very rewarding!

Myoflex, Blue Goo, are both more powerful, but if you are also looking for something that doesn't smell like medicine you should try Arnica.  Arnica could be found at specialty health food stores and is great for not making your clothes smell.  I know some tennis professionals use it, so that is why I am recommending it to you.
Nov. 23\\n\\nthanksgiving day is when we give thanks for all we have. the US associates it with pilgrims who settled in Plymouth, Massachusets. the Wampanog tribe helped them survive there. after the harvest, they had a feast. during that time it was not regarded as thanksgiving yet. harvest feasts were common in england and for the native american tribes. the pilgrims didn't hold a true thanksgiving until 1623 after a drought. Thanksgiving started to become and annual celebration in 1630 for the Massachusets Bay Colony. It started to spread after that.

Some Falcon species like peregrines and probably kestrels use tall city buidings to hunt and nest on as if they were cliff faces. The buidings, like cliffs, act as good vantage points (provide updrafts) to hunt other birds. As long as there is plenty of prey items like feral pigeons (peregrines) or mice to hunt (kestrels) they probably don't have many problems living in cities. Heavy pollution could be a problem?

Dan, I really think Americans currently live in fear. Fear of losing their jobs, fear of their credit score falling, and fear of jail and becoming a part of the 'system'.\\n\\nAt first this sounds like crazy conspiracy theory, but I do not subscribe to conspiracy personally. \\n\\nI see a war that the people do not support, and no one is marching against it this time (as in Vietnam). I see people being held against their will without charges and no one seems to care (as in Guantanamo Bay). I see employers being allowed to cut the rug out from under the worker (pay, benefits, etc). and yet no one quits or demands unions. \\n\\nPS, heaven help you if you step up and start to make a stink. I did for racism at my work place and my boss held a meeting and all but laughed in my face. Had to leave that job in the end over the whole matter.\\n\\nThe best thing I can recommend is educate yourself as much as possible (college and more college, current events, local politics). Vote. Support the things that need it, because for the most part they are under funded and under supported. \\n\\nAnd pass on the word that we all need to stop coasting, waiting for our 'shift' to end and start living. Participating and making the world a better place.
Yes! God wants you to be with him in heaven!\\nJesus died for us so that we would be with God!
America needs more political parties, a true representation of the make up of its people. If all your elected officials are rich white males, that usually hail from greedy,  repressed, right winged, red necked , fundamentalist families,  whom in most cases  hail  from the deep south and Midwest then Americas plot can  only continue to erode . \\nI do not mean to imply that Europeans are much different, after all the apple does not fall to far from the tree. and therefore  America will remain  the way that it  has always been, Racist Warmongering and Ignorant,  And as long as the Bush's and Kerry's keep being born with all the money and power , regardless of their mental capacities or moral turpitude  then the good citizens of America will  have  very little choice other than to remain ignorant,  afraid,  and poor of spirit. and accept whats on offer.\\n\\nAmericans must get out from in front of their TVs and off their lazy, fat asses and revolt take charge of their own destiny. because  "THE REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED"

I don't think that the Earth is as small compared to the sun as a golf ball compared to the Earth itself. \\n\\nI would say a Red Supergiant, one like Antares, the alpha star in Scorpius, would be much like the Earth when the Earth is compared to a golf ball.\\n\\nNew!:\\nI just received the information from Wikipedia.com and I did some calculations. \\nthe diameter of a golf ball is about 0.00004 km, \\nthe diameter of our Earth is about 12756 km,\\nand the diamter of Antares is about 924000000 km. \\n\\nSince calculating the volume requires us to cube the radius (let us ignore the pi and 4/3 for simplicity's sake since in ratio, they don't matter). So:\\nthe cube of the radius of the golf ball is 8 x 10^(-15) km cubed,\\nthe cube of the radius of our Earth is 2.6 x 10^(11) km cubed,\\nand the cube of the radius of Antares is 9.9 x 10^(25) km cubed. \\n\\nWe can get a brief idea of their sizes by comparing the powers of 10: \\n\\ngolf ball -> Earth is\\n1 -> 100000000000000000000000000\\nEarth -> Antares is\\n1 -> 100000000000000\\n\\nSo Earth is far bigger than a golf ball than Antares is than Earth (at least from my calculations). \\n\\nNow, returning to the questions, I would say something 1000000000000 times the size of Antares, probably a nebula.
From the Texas Department of Labor website:\\n\\n\\nBreaks are a common source of confusion for employers. As noted toward the beginning of this paper, the FLSA does not require employers to give breaks during the workday, but if breaks are given, certain rules apply. Rest or coffee breaks, defined as 20 minutes or less, are compensable hours worked under 29 C.F.R. 785.18, since they are regarded as being for the benefit of both the employer and the employee. Meal breaks, on the other hand, are not compensable, as long as they are at least 30 minutes in length and the employee is "completely relieved from duty for the purpose of eating a regular meal" (see 29 C.F.R. 785.19). Shorter meal breaks may be considered valid under special circumstances. The most frequent pitfall for employers is thinking that employees have true meal breaks if they are allowed to eat at their desks while answering phones, opening mail, sorting files, and so on. Such duties performed while trying to eat will render the time spent during the meal break compensable. Employers may control unauthorized work during meal breaks by the disciplinary process.

ARGENTINA, led by Diego Armando Maradona. They beat West Germany 3-2 with goals from: Brown (ARG) 23', Valdano (ARG) 55', Rummenigge (WG) 74', Völler (WG) 80', Burruchaga (ARG) 83'. It was their second title.
He's an old grouchy German dude who just happens to be the Pope.  Not only does he still wear the hat, but he'll sooo whip your shiny white with it if you get any funny ideas about that overhand, Mister.\\n\\nKeep in mind, God prefers Cricket, so he may kind of doze off while the Pope is playing Tennis.  I doubt the Pope gets an unfair advantage because of this unless he was going to get sneaky and cheat. But I kind of think God would know anyways.\\n\\nUnless, of course, the wind is just right.  Then the hat could be an advantage to itself, much like a sailboater's sail!  Get a little Pontifical Patewear action going in there and he could really go, I bet!

It's really impossible to recommend a bowling ball without seeing you bowl (for instance, what's your typical ball speed?).  The best answer is to visit your local pro shop, tell them that you throw a back up ball, and that you're not interested in being trained out of it, but you'd like a new ball.  Depending on where you bowl, and how the lanes are oiled, there might be something that the pro shop guy can recommend over the others.\\n\\nAs for a simple recommendation, any entry level resin ball (The Tornado series from Ebonite; Storm, Brunswick, Columbia  each make their own) will give you a simple hook--not a monster hook.
oh no no NO!!! perfect opportunity to get out of that relationship! yall jus got into a relationship and he pushing you to do it with him like that? GIRL! you better.. CLINK! CLINK! Lock down and say saranara to him!!!!.. NO means NO!! The fact that he keeps pressuring you to do it when u keep saying No, means that he has absolutely no respect for you yr body and yr wishes.. it will get out of hand! Im tellin you! if you aint ready, then you definitely should leave him! Do it early in the relationship b4 you get too attached to him and u cant let him go.. there are better men out there that will respect you and wait for u when yr ready..
He is wrong,,,, give him a break,,, let him of the hook.,,, and let him know in no uncertain terms , that you really do not believe him, but you will give him another break, If you ever see another inappropriate picture in his wallet ever again!!!  Oh the 2nd break will be a part of his body ,,,, pick somewhere that hurts,,, \\n                    Be nice,, really forgive him,,, do not torture him or anything or even bring it up,,but if it happens again,, time to go off!!!  \\n           my husband tried this very same bs,, when we got married, he had pics of his exes behind my framed pics,,, then when i told him to get rid of them or put them away he tried to hide them, i finally ripped them up and threw them all out, because he did not let me keep any pics of my ex,,,\\n            1st rule to survive marriage,,,Be loving, be sweet, be about business, take care of home, keep yourself on point,,,and do not be stupid!!!!
I think its a possibility. It definitely can't be disproven.
My husband has been in federal prison for 26 years.   \\n\\nRespecting the staff and behaving as if you have been reformed doesn't matter regarding earning good time.   You earn good time by specific acts, not by sucking up the staff or trying to BS anyone by pretending you finally found Jesus.    If it were that simple, everyone would walk out after a year.   \\n\\nMy husband files administrative remedies constantly against the staff for THEIR misconduct and lack of training and other violations, but has still earned good time.   So schmoozing the staff doesn't have anything to do with good time.\\n\\nThey earn good time by staying out of documented trouble, which results in time spent in SHU (the hole).   They can also participate in the (remaining) programs offered.\\n\\nA lot of the snitches also find out they can get good time for ratting out their cellie or another inmate.    They don't care if that guy gets another ten years for having a cigarette as long as they get five more minutes of good time.    Snitches are very common at low facilities, as most plea-bargained in the first place when they were convicted.    I wouldn't recommend that as a means of earning good time, tho, as there's often retaliation.   Even snitches don't like snitches.\\n\\nIf an inmate can stay out of documentable trouble, he can accrue good time, which DOES make a difference at the end.\\n\\nGood luck.
I do not know if this is the 'annihilator method' but here goes:\\n\\ny'' + 4y' + 4y = 2x + 6\\n\\nFirst solve y'' + 4y' + 4y = 0\\nK^2 + 4K + 4 = 0 \\nSo (K + 2)^2 = 0\\nie K = -2, -2\\nSolution is y = Ae^(-2t) + Bte^(-2t)\\n\\nNow for particular solution\\n\\nyp = Ax + B\\nyp' = A\\nyp'' = 0\\ny'' + 4y' + 4y = Ax + (4A + B)\\n= 2x + 6\\nSo A = 2 and 4A + B = 6 \\nSo B = -2\\n\\nThus the general solution is y = Ae^(-2t) + Bte^(-2t) + 2x - 2

I know the federal law Combined OmniBus R Act (COBRA) look this up on google which they have to offer you insurance, it is super expensive because you have to pay ALL of the costs, so for a family of four it is like 1200 a month, but the thing is it is a continuation of your old policy, they have to send that to you soon after leaving.  If they paid the 100% of the policy then they have the 'master' policy and you may be well right where you are now.  They are supposed to give 30 days, but that is NC law.  If you paid but it was a policy under the master they may only be liable to reimburse your premium for the month.

Your diet is the main thing. to get to your abs you need the fat off of them. eat low fat foods and do at least a half hour of cardio a day to burn fat. after that different excercises target different areas. the best excercise i've found to work your whole abdominal area is to get a large excercise ball and get in push-up position with your ankles on the ball. pull your legs up to your chest and stretch back to push-up position. you will have to work up to higher repititions as you go because it will hurt you at first. work up to five sets of twenty five reps. leg throws are also really good. lay on your back and have somebody stand at your feet. raise your legs up to the other persons waist or chest and have them throw them back down. you have to raise your legs back up without letting them touch the floor. work up to five sets of twenty five with those also

You're the only one that can answer this question. I think about sex as much as the next guy, but if you think about it 24/7, you're obsessed.
Firstly, you dump the concept of love and omit it from your vocabulary.  Then ah-ha, you can begin to figure some basic things out.  Stuff like how well do you communicate true and honest stuff.  Do you agree to disagree?  Can any and all topics be on the table without one or the other saying something lame like, "I don't wanna talk about that."  Does one or the other think they irreversibly have the plan for the other.  How much is seeped in a follies-filled belief' system.  Is it but the sex that is important but yet you distort?  Boil out all the fecal matter and it is the quality of your communication which will give you your answer.

The playoffs are not completely determined yet. The Lakers and the Clippers are both in the Western Conference. Their are two conferences (Eastern and Western). Their are 16 teams in each conference and 8 teams from each conference make the playoffs. The Clippers have guaranteed themselves of a spot in the playoffs and are positioned in the 6th seed, although they can jump up to the 5th seed depending on how they and the Memphis Grizzlies do in their last few games. The Lakers are not yet guaranteed of a spot in the playoffs (they have three games left to play), but they will most likely make it as the 7th seed in the Western Conference.
yes, u can definitely connect 2 computers together with a USB. Make sure your usb cable is the special kind, that is there's a box or some thing fat sticking out of the cable.

First, I won't go into the legality of downloading movies. There are copyright laws in the US that would make downloading movies a crime.

Scientists don't even know what gravity is.  They know how to measure it and account for it in calculations but don't know how it's generated.  They know it's one of the weaker forces in the cosmos and have identified a particle they call a graviton.  Once it is known how gravity is generated the next step will be how to counter it, or develop anti-gravity.

If the only handicap you gave McEnroe was one serve, I'd say Johnny Mac would kill them all. The fact is Johnny Mac never really needed more than one serve. With his wonderful slice spin, excellent direction, and relatively fast speed, John seldom double-faulted and baffled many good players.\\n\\nHowever, when you throw in the additional handicap of giving the women the doubles alleys to hit into, every single female tennis player you cited would kick John's butt.\\n\\nIndeed, each one of them can hit with enough angle and speed to not only hit a fair amount of winners, but also wear Poor Old John out.

Methylated spirits contains something like 95% pure alcohol, the rest is methanol. (The methanol is added to try and stop people drinking it). Alcohol in general is toxic to cells. The higher the %% of alchohol in a substance is the higher its toxics abities. At 100% it is so toxic to cells either through poisoning (or osmosis effects (sp)) it well kill cells quickly. Also due to its psyicial properties methylated spirits can quickly evporate into the air leaving the surface you applied to dry.

Steel is not an element, like oxygen, or a chemical compound, like water, but an alloy of iron and carbon, in which the two substances are mixed together physically, but not bound by any fundamental interaction.  So the limiting factor in steel manufacturing is the amount of iron available in easily mineable and refineable state.  Iron is one of the most common elements on earth, composing some 5% of the earth's crust.  \\n\\nDue to its high availability, and the fact that iron is not created nor destroyed in the steelmaking process, it is not exactly accurate to think of it as a question of how much steel is "left", but how much can be profitably exploited at current price levels.  The answer to that question is "a lot".\\n\\nEl Mutun in Bolivia is the richest provider of iron ore in the world, and it alone contains 40 billion tons of reserves.  For conmparison's sake, world consumption of Pig iron, the basic conponent of most steel, hovers around 500-600 million tons.

love is so beautiful...it's been explaination... you love a person because first you like him/her..then you feel hi/her care..and then because they love you you love them too... and also it is a wonderful feeling...i know i sound stupid...i am not doing a very good explaination here... but love is everything...because also this world is created out of love i guess it's an instinct for a human being to love someone else... for God is love
give your songs time, dont rush them, write about stuff that you actually know about, or stuff youre going through, but yeah, most importantly, give the lyrics time and wait until you get inspiration, dont reach out and grab your inspiration before it really shows up. if you wanna check out some of the stuff ive written it's here\\n\\nwww.myspace.com/brianwattier

i agree with lynda, as far as the clothes dont let the man lust over them, its all good. Loose fitted jeans and shirts do just fine for other men as its very unattractive. You can wear anything for your man when you and him are all alone.
as much as he can
I would wait.  Notify ebay of what is going on so that they too are informed.  And it is rude of the seller to be hounding you.  It sounds to me as if the Seller might need your money to pay for the tickets themselves.
Depends what type of evidence there is in the case.\\n\\nIf the person admitted to it in interrorgation, then yes, he would get off.  If there is a huge body of third party evidence that proves he did the murder then he can be still be tried and convicted on that.
Not all men, but i guess they be nice to get what they want, girls do this too :) usually its money

A running back will have all three attributes you have said, sometimes they are the fastest of the three positions and other time they are the strongest. \\nMost quarterbacks will have the least of these three attributes. I say most because of guys like, Michael Vick and Vince Young, they are exceptions. \\nWide receivers will have speed more than anything. They tend to be lighter in weight and taller.\\n\\nBest in their postions:\\nRunning back: LaDainian Tomlinson, great speed, strength and agility and can catch passes well too. He is the whole package when it comes to running backs.\\nQuarterback: Peyton Manning, smart, great arm and knows the games.\\nWide receiver: Steve Smith, undersized but plays big. Great hands, speed and runs great routes.

boys are stupid, throw rocks at them...  some guys (it seems most guys) want someone to look good.  what throws them is when the outside does not match the inside.  (Hmmm - she looks good on the outside... but... OMG she has a brain and her own opinion???  no way - she may find out that i am a dickweed)  i agree - when they are insecure with themselves - they want someone to make them look good...and not necessarily have a mind of their own.  if you have one that looks for the whole package... good for YOU!!!

unless otherwise contracted, either verbally or written and employee cannot work more than 5 consecutive hours without an eating period.   This period should be equal to no less than 30 minutes.\\n\\nSince no work is done during this time frame the employer is under no obligation to pay you for this time. \\n\\nthis time can also be divided in such a way that the employee can break up this time throughout the day to equal the 30 minutes.
ok if u want to talk to the guy talk to him but the best thing to do is wait for him to talk to u because if you wait for him to talk to u then u will kno if he likes u or not because if he likes u then he will talk to u first but if he dosnt like u then he wont talk to u at all but if u like the guy and u want to talk to him then u go right ahead and talk to him but i would wait for him to talk to u and if he says hi to u then ya say hi back and smile
First of all, the incorrect term is not "midget" nor is it "retard".  And usually when you do hear a beep, an person who did not steal anything would go back and willy have them examine their bag.  It doesn't take a retard to know this.  God, I hate ignorant people who talk that.
Your body sounds just fine....not at all a problem.  But you may want to check where your insecurity comes from.  You should feel as comfortable with yourself as you seem to look.
"The Way"  \\n\\nWould be walk in and drive through.\\n\\nWould serve fresh fruit, yougurt, healthy breads and fresh veggie and fruit juices in the mornings, in the afternoon it would offer an array of veggies, good carbs, healthy oils and fresh protiens (soy, fish, chicken, buffallo, beef...) and to up the ante for dinner, I would add dine-in multi course meals as oppossed to the traditional 'food on a tray', comprised of the same high quality fresh food.  It wouldn't either cater to Carnivores, Vegetarians or Vegans in particular.... simply offer the convenience of quality food for those that haven't the time to prepare it themselves.  \\n\\nAnd yes, I do think there is a market out there, even though the costs may be more than some are willing to pay.

I think its not a helpful way to deal with stress because it is harmful physically and because it doesn't really help you to manage the situations that cause stress. \\n\\nIt is impossible to avoid stress in life, so I think you are far better off learning coping skills that help you manage stress without harming yourself. Stress management, relaxation, seeking social support from others, and developing assertiveness skills are examples of coping methods that can be learned and have a long-term helpful effect for people.\\n\\nIf someone is cutting themselves to manage stress I suggest they talk to a trusted adult and find someone to help them learn more effective coping skills.

Get of your self rightous high horse and stop to realize that in order to learn, one must ask questions. You were not born educated in the word of God. You I'm sure asked many questions when you were wanting to learn about God. Where did you misplace your humility.\\n\\nIt's an attitude like yours that runs off the lost soul who is seeking out God's truth, and their salvaion through His truth. If they percieve all Chrsitians to spout off like you just did, they would not want to become a Chrisitan for fear of becoming like someone like you. And who could blame them?\\n\\nYou not only must obtain knowledge through the word of God, but you must adopt those very words into your being and behave as an ambassador of God. What you said in your post was ugly and rude and not the way God wants us to teach others.\\n\\n Proverbs 15:33 The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility \\n\\nDid it ever occur to you that other people may be getting spiritually fed from the answers that are given to those who ask questions that you feel are not worthy of yoru time to answer them?
I don't think anyone here has gotten the right answer yet.  Check back tomorrow though, someones bound to get it sooner or later.
WHOA!  Back up there slugger!  You're putting the cart before the horse.  So, you want to start a band?  And it's to be showcased at a talent show?\\nFirst, decide what kind of sound you're looking for.  Who's going to be in charge and make all of the decisions?  And everyone's going to agree to follow?  Assuming you're in charge.  Pick out the music you're going to perform.  Have sheet music.  What kind of instruments are going to be needed to achieve that sound?  Advertise and hold auditions.  Remember, not all studio musicians make good stage performers and Visa Versa.  Hold the auditions, get names, phone numbers and demo tapes of everyone.  Listen to what each has to offer, write down your ideas.  Take the tapes and listen to them again.  Pare it down and begin making your call backs.  Get everyone together and see if there's a chemistry -- you'll know it if there is.  Begin rehearsing.  Practice individually and then together.  Record yourselves and play it back so everyone can hear what you sound like as a group.  Keep practicing.  Give it about a year to really get the act down, practicing in front of small audiences -- not your family and friends, you'll never get them to tell the truth.  And when at last you are ready, take it to the stage.  Be prepared for squabbles within the band and always have an ace in the hole.  Someone doesn't like the way things are going and wants to do it their way, have a back up.  Do you have all of the equipment?  Is each individual going to be expected to buy and supply their own or are you planning on renting?  Starting a band isn't really so easy, but if you are determined and everyone is willing to commit, it can be done.  Be realistic.  Eventually, it will be fun.

It depends on where the 10 year old lives and family circumstances, but here are some of the things I have observed:\\n\\nswimming lessons, skating lessons, gymnastics, scouts, martial arts classes, video and computer games, organized sports, Boys and Girls clubs, art lessons, music lessons, drama classes, homework, some chores at home, visiting at friends' houses, reading, watching TV, pursuing hobbies, etc.\\n\\nI hope this helps.

I don't know about "neighboring nations"..what I do know is that we built a wall in CA and it was deadly.  I believe it was called "operation gatekeeper.....sorry...I don't have the right name" and it led to the deadliest year ever for immigrants.\\n\\nWhile alot of people will say....."Fuck yah.....build them there walls"\\n\\nWhen you build walls....people will tunnel, they will construct amazing ladders.\\n\\nMy answer.....there are far too many literal fences (you said that) and we will never get it right.

You can't put your own music.\\nBut if you find the band you want, go on their site and look for the playlist on the right hand upper corner.  Then click on "ADD" and it will ask you to confirm for "ADD" that song to your profile.\\nHope that helps.
Well, I am a white woman, and I always say "thank you" when someone holds the door open for me.\\n\\nThe reason some do not is that they have no manners, plain and simple.
The license will be anywhere from $10,000 to $150,000 or more, depending on where you are.  Budget for 6 months lease (sign a longer lease but have enough money in the bank to cover 6 months). Inventory to open will be another $2000-10,000 or more. If you want to sell food, add another $2000-20,000 to your licensing fees.  Furnishings, equipment... that may come with the space, or you pay for it.  Payroll for the first 2-4 months.  Business insurance will be $5000-20,000 or more per year. City and state business permits, tax certifications and all the other various licenses, permits and such will be another $2000-10,000.\\n\\nMore important are your costs for the first 2 years or so. Most new restaurants and bars don't break even in the first year. That means it costs more to be open than you bring in. So you'll be covering the shortfalls yourself as the owner--- particularly the liquor bills and payroll.  And remember, as the owner, you're not on the payroll. Your staff gets paid before you do.  And a lot of first-time owners don't factor that in, which is why 50% of these new businesses fail in the first year and only about 20% make it to the 5th year (search for Nation's Restaurant News, they have an online magazine somewhere with all these statistics).\\n\\nYou can make a lot of money owning a bar but it takes a while to get there. In the DC area where I live, it's well over $150,000 just to open the doors. In a rural area you may be able to do it on $50,000. But make sure you double your estimate, so once you open, you can cover the bills, till you start making money.
I lived there for 16 years, moved Back to TX last year.\\n\\nFirst, I cannot imagine what you are comparing rental prices to, but they are not low in Las Vegas.\\nHouses to buy, whether new construction or existing  houses are also VERY expensive. We moved because we sold our 1953 (year built) house in a very nice but modest neighborhood, mostly hispanic, for three times what we paid for it. It was very close to downtown and close to the concentration of those elements you don't like. These houses are the lowest priced available  and for many are in an undesireable location. When we sold, our house at very near 200,000 dollars was as cheap as you could buy a decent house of 1200 sq ft any where in the city. Anything costing less would be a destroyed house with crack squatters living in it.\\n\\nAs far as living there, the culture is very different and employers have NO employee regard. The reason is because there are plenty of people anxious to take your job if you don't like something. \\n\\nIf you can let all this roll off you, and we could, living there is fun. You can have a real good time just people watching on the strip or downtown. You must use good judgement if you are g oing to gamble, set your limit and stick to it! Remember you are not going to get rich gambling. We called the sale  of our house our jackpot!\\n\\nThere are many fun things t o do around Las Vegas, Lake Meade, Mt Charleston, you are very near Zion National Park in Utah, very near California, 5hours to LA, \\n\\nOut in the suburbs life for your children would be fairly normal if you can afford to buy or rent there, check out Green Valley, for starters.\\n\\nIf you go there, the best to you, enjoy it and keep your good judgement!\\n\\n\\nYou may e-mail me if you have more specific questions.
Everclear I will buy you a new life

Well, DMSO shouldn't smell anyway, if it does that is impurities in the solution like dimethyl sulfide. Anyway, since DMSO is a fairly simple compound with no forces other than covalent holding it together it should be fine at 60C. The shelf life of DMSO I believe is fairly long--as long as its not from the 60s and as long as you keep it in a dark bottle because it is sensitive to light!

Usually, only one USB port on a laptop is 2.0 compliant, you have to find out which one it is. Also, if you are putting anything between the USB port on the computer and the USB drive, like an external HUB, make sure that IT is 2.0 compliant. Plugging a 1.1 HUB into  2.0 port makes it all run at 1.1, thus anything you connect that is 2.0 will bring up that message.\\n\\nLastly, go into the device manager and look to see in USB devices if there is a USB 2.0 driver listed there, if not then contact the laptop manufacturer to see if they can help you get it back.
